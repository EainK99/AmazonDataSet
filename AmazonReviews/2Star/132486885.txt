After reading lots of great reviews I thought I would give this a try.  We had lots of problems with noise when moving around inside our house. I turned off all likely noise sources (cell phones, florescent lights, etc.) and this didn't help much.  We then tried it outside (free of other noise sources) and still had problems.  We also had a pretty limited range of about 50 or 60 feet before I started to loose the signal.  This was being tested with a camcorder that I had previously used with a borrowed Sennheiser wireless mike, and that configuration worked great, so it's probably not my camcorder.  Try both frequencies and had the same results either way.  Maybe they were just defective, but I've returned them, and I'll end up spending a bit more money on a better set.
