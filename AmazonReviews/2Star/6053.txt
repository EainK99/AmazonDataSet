The Poly Tune mode, which is its key distinguishing feature, doesn't seem to work very well. The tuner implements this mode automatically if you strum all six strings at once. (You need to do this without fingering a chord; otherwise, it will revert to regular (single string) tuning mode and display the root note of the chord.) At least in my unit, the D string indicator often fades away very quickly or won't display at all. I tried this on both an electric and acoustic guitar and there was no difference. When I viewed a few YouTube videos reviewing this product, the reviewer's unit had the same problem, although the problematic indicator might have been for a different string. One reviewer tried strumming with his thumb versus a pick, or increasing the volume of the strum but that didn't seem to make much of a difference.  I'll probably keep the product since it's solidly built and seems to work alright with single string tuning. But had I known the Poly Tune feature was so iffy, I would have opted for a less expensive tuner.
