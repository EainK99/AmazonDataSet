I love Aquila Strings in General.  All my ukes have them.  I bought the REDS and loved them.  Until the first one broke.  I love the feel, the sound, its clean and loud.  Love that... but they broke again, and again, and again.  WARNING.  These strings break.  Consistently break.  I'm sorry but I can not recommend them.
