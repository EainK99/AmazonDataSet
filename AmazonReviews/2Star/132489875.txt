Purchased the Aerodyne Bass over a year ago(after the Honeymoon). I thought it was perfect at first but after a year I sold it and bought an American Special Jazz Bass for about the same price( with a scratch). Here is the deal. Positives: Slim Neck, Light Weight and Versatile with a PJ configuration, a cool look sort of like a Movado watch.<br />Negatives: If you are used to playing real Fender Basses you may fall out of love with this Bass quickly.<br />Bass Wood will leave you with the Middy Blues, Midrangey on both pickups, missing high end focus and even a clear Pbass punch. I spent a lot of money upgrading pickups, the so called Japanese quality I guess went out with the 80's. Cheap pots and wiring! looked like a old squire electronics, the carved top looks ok but the upper bout is not beveled like a Jazz bass it's smooth but flat at the start of the curve(like an upright or violin). This starts to pinch the nerve in you arm( real jazz is ergonomically perfect( a smooth slope), the neck is not like the new slim-C it's more like an Ibanez neck or some Fender Copy. If you do want to upgrade you will have to ream out the pickup cavity and deal with the slope of curve top to get things to fit right and even with that design and nature of this bass it will not sound much different. After playing upright I can say it's nice to have fret markers a fast neck is great as long as you are hitting the notes.<br />After purchasing another American Jazz I can say for about the same money you are getting a quality instrument(Electronics, solid fit and finish and a perfect FENDER Sound. Yes, the Alder is heavy and the bass is beefy but Leo got it right the first time around. If you really want that Fender growl and punch. DON\\"T buy this BASS.....
