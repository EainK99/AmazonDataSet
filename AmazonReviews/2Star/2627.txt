Sounds amazing when it works but has been in for repair 3 times in one year. Horrible build quality and reliability.  I will never buy an Egnater product again. It's a real shame that Bruce Egnater would even put his name on these Chinese built piles of junk. Twice the warranty repair was done incorrectly, I finally just gave up and went to another tech and now there is conveniently more problems as soon as the 2 year warranty is up.  You can find these for 300-500 on craigslist because none of them work.  Egnater has ruined their brand with horribly build quality and even worse warranty service.  Bummer because like I said, it sounds when it works.
