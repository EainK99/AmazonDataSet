I was looking for headphones for movie watching, so I purchased these because they got decent reviews. I didn't like the sound. The mids and highs were too much for me. I tried to get rid of the hissing sound with 2 different equalizers but couldn't. And every &#34;S&#34; was like a screech. I don't know what they sound like with music. But if you're looking for headphones for movie watching, let me suggest the Sony MDR7506. They are a little more expensive, but well worth it. I went through several headphones from $30 to over $100 before deciding on them.
