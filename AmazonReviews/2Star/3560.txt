It is well built and strong for sure.  It definitely works for holding your guitars.  However, when I bought it, I was looking to hang my guitar at one end of my closet, not in the middle. The part of this product that actually holds the guitar is made of rubber & is very tight.  For this reason, I couldn't hang my warlock with it because it rested on the strings & constantly bent them.  Also, because it is too tight, you have to turn the guitar in order to get it off of the hanger which is the reason why you wont want to hang it at the end of your closet.
