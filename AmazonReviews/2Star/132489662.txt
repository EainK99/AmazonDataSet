I rolled the dice on this bag for 25 bucks and lost. There is absolutely no padding, just straight fabric. The only thing I like about it is it has two separate compartments. I bought this for my speaker stands, but ended up just putting a couple microphone stands in one side and a music stand and guitar stand in the other. It is okay for the money, but I would not buy it again.
