I've gone through 2 of these tuners now. Both failed after about 4 weeks of normal use.<br />NO MORE.<br /><br />Love the accuracy. Love the display. Love the strobe technology.<br />BUT the reliability is absolutely, inexcusably, frustratingly HORRIBLE.<br /><br />Both units that I purchased worked great for about 4 weeks, then just stopped powering up.<br />It was not a battery issue. Even after replacing the battery, neither unit would power up.<br /><br />The case also came apart spontaneously on one of the units. I couldn't believe it.<br />One half of the metal case just came apart while I was playing.<br /><br />If you want an excellent tuner that will work for about a MONTH before failing at the worst possible moment, BUY IT.<br />You will LOVE it... for about a month.<br /><br />If you want a reliable tuner that you can count on for years... RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY.<br /><br />You have been warned.
