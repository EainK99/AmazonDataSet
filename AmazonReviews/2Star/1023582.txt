The violin does not have fine tuners! Which is not okay for beginner students. I am also familiar with Gliga violins, this violin does not retail at $500.00, it retails at $308.00. I would not pay more than $250.00 for the whole outfit including violin, case, bow and rosin. The quality of Gliga violins is impeccable but this seller is asking too much.
