As others have mentioned, this is a really thin foam.  I was hoping to use it to deaden the sound from the fan on my desktop computer.  I was considering building a secondary enclosure with this stuff on the inside.  As a quick test, I surrounded the computer tower with layers of this foam.  An admittedly a crude experiment, but there was no noticeable difference in the noise level.  Disappointed.
