i purchace this for a lo budget project.  i was not expecting the best but the tuners had to be tossed,  The locking thread worn out after the first tring was held, and when tuned they would slip on the bearing, not only that, one of the tuner had a defect that scratched the shell / nut.  theses are not 3l 3r but 6in line.
