I'd first like to say that I love the Snark tuner. I really do. So why do you give it only two stars and write a head line like that, you might ask. &#34;The Good&#34; is the tuner is an inexpensive, easy and accurate way of keeping your guitar (or other stringed instrument) in tune. It really does the job quite well. You'll be happy with that. &#34;The Bad&#34; is the fact that the construction is flimsy. In an effort to give the display a wider range of motion, so that it can be turned to face the guitarist, the clip portion attaches to the tuner portion by snapping a plastic ball into a circle of plastic clips on the back of the tuner segment. These clips break because they are plastic. &#34;The Ugly&#34; is that I have been thru three Snarks in three years. I handle the Snark with great care, especially after seeing what happened to the first one. After the second one broke, I was just plain afraid to touch it at all. The third one just broke, once again for no apparent reason. I am torn between staying with a product I like and going to Polytune, who's design looks to be sturdier.
