Loved the sound that came from it, but it wouldn't stay on the instrument when removing the instrument cable from the pickup's jack.  I even tried using double sided tape on the cork to see if that made a difference. Maybe mine was slightly bent or maybe my mandolin (The Loar) was just too glossy - either way, it didn't work for me And kept popping off so had to send it back.  I attached some pictures how it looked on my instrument if you're interested.
