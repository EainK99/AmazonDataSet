I was so happy to order this necklace finally to match my earrings.  The Flute was perfect, but the chain leaves something to be desired.  Esp. the clasp.  It was cheep and wouldn't open.  I kept trying, had my son try, and it broke.  I figured instead of returning item, I'd just go get a new clasp and replace.
