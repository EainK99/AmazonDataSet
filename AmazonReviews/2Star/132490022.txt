This system is okay. It isn't loud enough for the size it is. If you turn the volume up all the way, the sounds are muffled so you cannot utilize the volume. Also, we had to purchase a separate adapter in order to use with an IPOD. This was very decieving in the add and on the model description. I had to call the manufacturer to learn that i had to buy a separate cord.
