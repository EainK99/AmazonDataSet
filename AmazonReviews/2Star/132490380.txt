This product seemed great. The price was on par with my budget, and had 4 spaces like I needed. This was all great until I tried to fit my Alesis Midiverb 4 in the rack. The screws included were fine, but the inserts were of a different thread, and resulted in stripping, on both sides. This was a problem already. I then tried my own screws, and they only worked on one side, and that's when I realized that all 4 sides (back and front) were of different threads... Don't buy, it will only lead to complication.
