Simple 3 button remote/controller, no instructions inclded with it so obviously self-explanatory and obvious key functions.<br />When plugged into the ADJ Dekker Effect Light, it did not do anything, did not change any functions or programs.<br />Returned it to Amazon. Thank you Amazon for great customer service as always! :)
