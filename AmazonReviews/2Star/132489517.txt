Hello, my name is Kelly Parker, band director at PRMS, the 2nd best middle school band class in Florida. One of my 6th graders had recently bought this clarinet, and I must say, this is NOT a good clarinet. It is made of plastic, the edges of the case come off quickly, the tone is just constantly flat due to it being made of plastic, no. If you want a clarinet, not this one.
