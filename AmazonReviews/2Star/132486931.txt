Even at a beginner's level this product is poor. Slide sticks and scrapes when moved; boring is off center to pipe (one side of the pipe of thicker than the other); the mouth piece receiver scored the mouth piece to the brass the first time it was inserted.<br />Perhaps Rugeri has a nicer line worth trying...
