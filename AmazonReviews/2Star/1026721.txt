This instrument does not play the notes advertized. It plays (from low to high) GABCDE. These are the first 6 notes of a G major scale, but it is not a pentatonic scale, so do not buy this as a replacement for a Choroi pentatonic flute. It is A LOT less expensive than a Choroi, and there are many pleasant melodies that can be played with this, but I don't really know why anyone would get this instead of a soprano recorder, which can play far more notes as the musician becomes capable.
