I bought the PercPad on the basis of its sensitivity and MIDI output. Imagine my disappointment to discover that the MIDI out does NOT pass any velocity (\\"how hard was the pad hit\\" or \\"how loud should I play this sound\\") information from the pads! I confirmed this limitation with Alesis, who also commented that there is no planned update to address this serious shortcoming.<br /><br />The built-in sounds are fine, and they respond very well to different hits: but if you're looking for a MIDI drum controller, look elsewhere.
