I realize they are designed a little different from other Bluetooth earbuds but these just barely work. The sound is good though my phone recognizes them only as keyboard and I can't type anything with them connected. They do fit my ears but it took quite a bit of work to get them to stay in and the little bit that sticks between the speaker and the outside makes it really awkward and does nothing to help.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't recommend them unless you want this very particular style. They are just too awkward but are ok for cheap Bluetooth earbuds. If want better ones I'd spend the little be extra to go a step up which I plan to do when I can.
