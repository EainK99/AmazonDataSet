Got this along with my new Sennheiser S25 II - man, this case IS SO MASSIVE!, so big - it's totally impractical. Clearly looks top quality, looks and feels... for a pro musician traveling all the time this would be amazing - but for a mere mortal DJ and music enthusiast like me, this case in horrible big. I will return it.
