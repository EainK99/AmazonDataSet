most of the effects are unusable<br />on the up side, the chorus, delay and defretter effects are as good as it gets as far as stomp boxes go. almost worth keeping the whole unit just for those alone. the auto wahs, synths, compressor are mind blowingly bad. the distortion and overdrive are just okay, you might get away with those if you needed to.<br />mine was a used unit from guitar showcase for 99 bucks, you might conclude that was the problem. either way its going back.
