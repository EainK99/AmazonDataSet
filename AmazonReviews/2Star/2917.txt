I had high hopes for this microphone, but at the current street price of $109, it's just not worth it. There are a lot of better options out there. Read on for my full review...<br /><br />I have several microphones for recording podcasts, doing live Google Hangouts, and Skype calls with colleagues that are all over the world. I was really optimistic about the CAD Audio U39 USB condenser microphone, because I'd love to have another full-size mic so I could have one setup at both my home office and my work. Unfortunately, this mic didn't impress me at all.<br /><br />Upon opening the box, I liked the minimalistic packaging. It almost looked like Amazon's &#34;frustration free&#34; packaging, but it was clear this was the manufacturer's standard packaging. It was simple, easy to open, and had minimal waste. Inside, the microphone, USB cable, and tripod were all wrapped separately in plastic.<br /><br />The microphone itself seems to be made fairly well. The mic is made of metal and has a good weight to it, but the buttons and volume dial are plastic and feel kind of cheap. Overall though, the construction of the microphone is pretty good.<br /><br />The microphone stand, however, is complete crap. It's lightweight plastic, and felt like it was going to break when I opened it for the first time. I would definitely want a heavier stand - the microphone is pretty heavy and the tripod doesn't feel very stable. Add a pop filter and it would tip over.<br /><br />The sound quality of the CAD U39 microphone left a lot to be desired. The sound levels were crazy high... even after manually turning the levels down and moving back at least 12&#34; from the microphone I was still spiking well above acceptable ranges. Compared to several other microphones I own this mic has very high output levels. That requires some adjusting before recording because you can't really fix that in post production.<br /><br />The sound itself was a little disappointing too. I really love the rich, deep sound my Samson G-Track USB Condenser Microphone gives me, and this CAD U39 was mich higher pitched and was not nearly as welcoming. Maybe it works well for vocals, I don't know, but I didn't like the sound I got out of it.<br /><br />In the end, there are a LOT of other options in the $100 price range, I could not consider this a serious contender. Between Samson, Audio-Technica and Blue, there are a lot better options out there to consider.ep sound my Samson G-Track USB Condenser Microphone gives me, and this CAD U39 was mich higher pitched and was not nearly as welcoming.
