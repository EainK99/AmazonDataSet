I have a very large repository of one-of-a-kind audio tapes from past musical performances, which I'm slowly digitizing using Digitope Audio Digitalizer. This is not an enjoyable process using Digitope. I have not used other programs than this one for this process, so this is not a comparison review, just a stand-alone review.  Here are some of my biggest frustrations with this software:<br /><br />1) Buggy.  Often crashes, sometimes is able to save the file, sometimes not.  I often have to completely redo the tape transfer to get a successful audio file (set.)<br /><br />2) No simultaneous play-through audio.  It should be simple for them to have it play on the computer speakers during the recording process.  Why the *&%$ didn't they build that in?<br /><br />3) Cannot cope with different artists for different mp3 tracks.  If one changes one track artist, it changes them all.  Very frustrating...  Have to manually rewrite the mp3 tags after completing the save.  Argh.<br /><br />4) Has difficulty with play-back from software during editing.  Sometimes crashes.  Very frustrating, since I'm only doing the playback because of problem #2.<br /><br />5) CD creation doesn't work well.  I've given up trying to create CDs using this software, and have decided to just do mp3's out of respect for my own time.<br /><br />For a $30 program, these problems should be resolved.  It is possible to record using free programs like audacity.  I should have taken other's advice and saved my $30.
