Been using it for a year or more, and it's great, except that the design prevents you from tightening the knob that allows it to rotated up and down.  It's tucked up under the clip part too far, so you can't get your hand in there to get a good hold on it.  This is a big problem, because the iPad's weight rotates it down because you can't get it tight enough.<br /><br />Terrible design for the tightener...it's like no one ever tried it before putting it on the market.  Love everything else about it.  Fix that, and it would be 5 stars.
