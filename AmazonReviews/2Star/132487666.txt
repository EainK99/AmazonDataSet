i had the old 3500 fail after 15 years<br />so i bought this<br />im in a southern rock band and first noticed people telling me to turn up<br />usually im told to turn down,<br />at practice this is fine , but when you need the punch ,i had to turn it up to number 7 and then heard some distortion<br />my old one i would never turn past number 3<br />but with others on here saying it last only a year or less, makes me worry mine will soon be dead
