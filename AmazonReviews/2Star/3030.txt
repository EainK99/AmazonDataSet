I have several trombones here.  It works great on those without triggers, but terrible on the ones with triggers.  Large or small hands, the plsatic cuts into your hand in the trigger horns, and it's just not a good investment.  Worked nice on the non trigger instruments, but that's not why we bought it.  If it was any more expensive I would send it back for a refund
