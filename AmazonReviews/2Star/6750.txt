This amp has serious reliability problems.  I purchased one a while back, left it in the box for about a year, and when I finally pulled it out and played it, the sound was underwhelming to say the least. After about two hours of time on the amp, it stopped working, and there was a burning smell.  Got disappointed, put it back in the box and forgot about it.  Another year goes by, and my interest in tube amps is renewed.  I pulled the amp back out of the box, pulled it apart and found that the mains fuse and the F1 fuse were both blown.  Also, the V3 output tube (EL84, branded &#34;China&#34;) was also shorted.  Surprised the heater fuse didn't go as well.<br /><br />The fuses for this are not the standard fuses you see in most tube amps, they are about 3/4&#34; long, and kind of a pain to source at the specified values.<br /><br />My advice - If you buy one of these, put respectable tubes in it before you play it.  If you take the gamble of gigging with it, bring a second amp along so you don't have to rip the chassis apart, discharge the filter caps, and fumble with fuses and tubes in the middle of your set.<br /><br />Be REALLY careful with tube changes on this amp.  The sockets are mounted directly to the PCB, and it flexes when you pull/insert tubes.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving it two stars is that it is a nice little package, and the layout is simple enough to easily understand and modify if you wish.<br /><br />I'll keep this review updated as things progress.  Happy playing!
