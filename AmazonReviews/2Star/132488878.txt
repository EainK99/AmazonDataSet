As a follow up to my last review regarding a squealing noise on my recordings: Tascam Customer service notified me that if the product is over 1 year, there is a $60 diagnosis fee that will be added to the repair fee (which is unknown, of course). The fee is not refundable. They also wrote \\"I also want to mention that this model is not cost effective to repair in case your warranty period has expired.\\" I won't buy another Tascam product again.
