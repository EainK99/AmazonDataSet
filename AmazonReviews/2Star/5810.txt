I bought this on Primeday because Ive been wanting a microphone for recording my guitar playing through an actual tube amp rather than direct in, and after reading other reviews I thought all the other negative reviews were people who simply didnt read the instructions or didnt know how to work it properly. Well, now I know the product is just low quality. I guess you get what you pay for, if you want a good quality mic, you gotta spend some money.<br /><br />I have lots of problems with recording my guitar amp with this. At first I was getting feedback and it was hyper sensitive, but after I fixed the hypersensitivity issue, I was left with what I can only describe as a modulation issue. Everything I was recording and playing back would be modulated meaning it would shift in pitch, swirl, and warble to name a few. It makes the mic totally useless for my purposes.<br /><br />I tried everything to fix it to no avail. I read about changing computer settings, so I did everything I could there and nothing. I read about grounding issues, so I literally unplugged everything in my recording room besides my amp and nothing. I read about certain lights messing with it so I actually unscrewed the lightbulbs and took them out of the room, and nothing. Nothing I did would fix the issue, the mic is just worthless to me.<br /><br />The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the construction and feel of it is pretty nice and the mic stand is decent as well for my needs, but the functionality of the mic itself is terrible.
