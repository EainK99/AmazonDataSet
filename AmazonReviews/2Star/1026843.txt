I ordered this item as a back up to my Mixdeck Express. Simple item didn't need the best. Pavilion Electronics sent me a Numark Mixtrack which is a much cheaper item!!! No RCA outputs and pretty much unusable for me. By looking at other reviews they did this intentionally so buyers beware. Make sure they send you the correct item.  That being said they did refund my money promptly. But overall it was a poor experience.
