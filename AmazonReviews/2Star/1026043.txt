I was not happy with this product.  While I have the Swan 10 hole chromatic harmonica which I keep on me almost always, I wanted the extended range of the 16-hole.  I ordered the boat-shaped harmonica, and received the straight harmonica instead.  Also, the lower register notes are both out -of-tune as well as dying in mid-blow/draw (I'm guessing) due to the quality of the wind savers used in the harmonica.  I wanted to return it, but did not have ink in my printer for the UPS return slip and missed the deadline.  I may take it apart to see if I can fix/improve it myself, but I am truly unhappy with the quality of the unit as-is.  Due to my previous harmonica, I expected more, and that is the only reason I gave it an extra star - I hope this was an aberration.
