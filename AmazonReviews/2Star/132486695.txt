The legs come loose all the time and need to be tighten, the hinge has been too stiff to lift.  And with adjusting the screws to loosen the hinges it then slides and gets disjointed.  The top has now completed been separated from having to use force to lift so it is completely broken.  I would not get this item again.  We can still sit on it but not for very long I am sure as one of the legs will be lost soon.
