First I must comment on all the reviews stating that this is a &#34;REAL iRIG!!!&#34;  That is not a review of the quality of the product.  Only the name printed on it.  Who cares if it's a real iRig if it's still crap?<br /><br />The one I got did come in an iRig package if that for some reason matters to you.  But it cracks a lot while recording and there almost no isolation between the headphones and microphone.  So expect anything sent to your headphones (like maybe a metronome click track) to also be recorded (at a slightly lower volume than your actual input).<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it is really cheap, so I don't feel like I was really ripped off.  It may have some limited uses for someone out there.
