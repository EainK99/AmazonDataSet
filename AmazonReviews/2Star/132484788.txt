I would pass on this one.  I understand that a floating bridge always create additional complications.  In this case, in addition to the standard complications, when I would need to fine tune a specific string, I would run out room on the screw to tune it.  My kid ended up putting this guitar aside and we bought in inexpensive fixed bridge ax and, eventually, a more expensive replacement without a floating bridge.  I don't know if a real Floyd Rose Birdge/Tremelo would have eliminated this, but I would have been better off not buying this guitar.
