The Fender Unkelele received tuning gears DO NOT hold the tension so the uke continually has to be retuned.<br /><br />The 4th string supplied is a nylon derivative which produces a flat poor sound. Based on the cost, I believe the 4th string should have been the bronze wound. This produces a crisp, clear tone which matches the tone and clarity made by strings 1-3.<br /><br />A shame the company decided to go the cheap route.
