This mic requires CR2025 button battery. You can get them for like 3 bucks at radio shack, they are not included.<br />This mic breaks audio bad, it peaks out at a low level and sounds like a speaker at a drive through. I wouldn't bother with this mic, it was a waste. It has power and I'm guessing it's suppose to do noise canceling but it doesn't. Cord is about 4 feet, the pic has a disk that turns on the bottom that lets you turn off the power so that you don't waste your battery. One batter gives you about 100hours of life.
