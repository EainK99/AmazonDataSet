I bought a \\"Used - Like New\\" Snark SN-8 from Amazon Warehouse Deals.  It arrived broken where they all seem to break:  one of the three little plastic boogers, that form the cup of the ball joint between the display and the clip, had broken off.  On inspection, I found that my \\"Like New\\" tuner wasn't like new at all:  it had been broken and glued before being sold to me. The glue had simply let go, as most glues will do when applied to most hard plastics.<br /><br />Never buy a used Snark tuner unless the seller guarantees that it has never been broken.  On the other hand, if you read the customers' reviews here on Amazon, you'll see that buyer after buyer has experienced the same defect, even with new devices.  My impression is that they break because they're poorly designed, and they can't be repaired.  I'm told that they're pretty good little tuners, so it's a real shame about that design flaw.  If they ever fix that, I'll give 'em another try.
