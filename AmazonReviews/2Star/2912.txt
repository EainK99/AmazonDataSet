I've used these headphones for 3 years. My main complaint is that they squeeze my head too tightly and hurt my head/ears when I wear them 30+ minutes. I tried increasing the cushioning but that didn't help. My only other complaint is the film on the cushioning has deteriorated, and leaves small bits of black film whenever I wear them.
