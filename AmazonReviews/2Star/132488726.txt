The outside design is pretty cool.  But the unit did not work properly, stalled, locked up in the middle of programs, had to unplug & plug it back in to start working again, universal controller did not seem to work with it (did not change any functions).  Additionally, the lighting effect was not really impressive, to be honest, didn't really wow us, just sort of 'standard' round dots circling around, gets quite boring very quickly...<br />Also, expected to be able to separate the blue light from the other lights and use it by itself- appears can't do that with this unit, checked all the programs and did not find one where you can use only the blue led.<br />Returned it to Amazon. Excellent customer service, as always. :)  Thank you Amazon!
