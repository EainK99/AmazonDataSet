I don't know what to say. I tried to troubleshoot with this thing but I couldn't find a single microphone port in the entire house that would work with it. I've never once had this kind of problem before. I'm not a genius but I like to think I am smart enough to work a microphone.<br /><br />I'd suggest looking elsewhere unless you have an Olympus device you plan to use this one.
