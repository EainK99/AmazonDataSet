Update to review 1/28/14:  I have been through two units now.  The first one died on me within a few months. I tried to return it to Novation and after two weeks of waiting on an RA I sent it back to Amazon.  Praise Amazon Prime for their quick turnaround.  One year later the new replacement has gone bad.  I lost one channel output on this unit.  Having said that, I guess you get what you pay for.  Build quality is not so great.  This is still a decent unit for the price but it has many limitations.  I cannot trust this controller's quality and have since switched to a Pioneer DDJ SR.  All I can say about the Pioneer is WOW!  Ok, I have been using this controller for about a year and a half now so this is a complete review:<br /><br />I went from a Rane TTM57 using Scratch and two Techniques turntables to this controller.  Basically 3 flight cases and close to 100lbs VS. something that fit in my bag and could easily be carried to gigs.  Big thumbs up here!<br /><br />Getting used to the controller was a very short transition.  This thing is easy to use, lots of cue point buttons and lots of effect controls.  Another Thumbs up.<br /><br />Where I had some difficulty:  Getting volume levels balanced between channels took some getting used to.  The master/cue fade does not help since the master volume is much louder than the cue volume through this method.  I keep in on cue now and hit the headphone A - B buttons now to go back and forth to sync volumes.  My concern here is that these buttons get a lot of use and may not last.  This is yet to be seen however.<br /><br />Output volume:  Yes, the reviews are correct.  It is a USB powered controller so output volume must be bumped up if you want to gig with this controller.  I went out and bought a mini-powered mixer with multiple outputs.  I bought the ARTcessories Power Mix III for about $75.  Problem solved and it very small and compact.<br /><br />Reliability:  I did have a problem with my first unit.  The USB interface just died.  Going through Novation to get this fixed was a nightmare.  It took weeks to get an RA from them.  Alas, Amazon prime!  Finally got fed up and just returned it for a new unit with my prime account.  Hassle free and quick 2 day turnaround.  Thank you Amazon Prime!<br /><br />Overall, a great unit with a few small problems that have been overcome.  I did get in on the free UDG gig bag offer Novation was running for a while.  That really offset the cost of the mixer.
