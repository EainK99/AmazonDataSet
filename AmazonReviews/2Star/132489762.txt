I would like people to know that the craftsmanship of this bowl is poor . The painting is cheap and is peeling off and the cushion is to small for the bowl. And when contacted by company to resolve issues with this  product there was false promises and dishonest business tactics that arose. Ultimately resulting in a loss for me a buyer on internet.
