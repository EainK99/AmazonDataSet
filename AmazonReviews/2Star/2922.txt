I returned this keyboard soon after purchase. The keys had inconsistent sensitivity; the same amount of force produced notes of differing volume depending on the key. In addition, the unit did not lie smoothly flat, causing it to wobble when played. It's possible that the unit I received was simply defective. Regardless, the keyboard felt cheaply built for the $80 price.
