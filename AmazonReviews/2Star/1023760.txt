Everything came fine & nothing was broken. While the hot shoe fixture did indeed feel a bit plasticy (in comparison to metal), but at this price and intended use it is okay. However, being mounted on 5D3 it has produced high-pitch noise in both magic lantern and in-camera video recording. I've tried all combos of high-low gain in camera and microphone (with pulling up in software, if needed), but noise was there. Yes, recorded sound had stereo panorama, it was crispier, but so was high-pitch noise. Software removal of noise brought quality to about the same level with in-camera recording. Hence, I've returned it back. Too bad, since form-factor was nice. I guess it forces me to look at larger recorders, like H5, that can supply higher level of signal and let me avoid camera preamp. I used Rode Stereo Pro earlier, its output was high enough to avoid camera preamp, but it needed battery. Two stars since it is still not a complete disaster (stereo).
