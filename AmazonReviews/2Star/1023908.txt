I really hate to write negative reviews, but I was really disappointed with this instrument. I'm a professional guitar and uke player and I really got into banjoleles when I was in San Francisco a few weeks back. I picked up a Gretsch concert series and LOVED it. I saw this instrument and immediately fell in love with it because of the aesthetics. I made a big mistake. This instrument does not have nearly the tone or resonance of the Gretsch I bought for the same price. I adjusted it as much as I could, sent it back and got a replacement and tried again...still inferior in comparison. I cannot recommend this instrument for much other than a cool looking display piece.
