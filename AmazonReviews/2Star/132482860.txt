I purchased these units to use for conference panels in moderately sized rooms.  The receivers are no more than 30 feet from the speakers.  There was a lot of dropping in and out (interference, lost signals).  Not thrilled with it.  I've only used once, and I'm going to try some other approaches.  It was not a clean first gig, despite a very short distance between mic and receiver. Had to work the eq a bit more than I prefer too.  But again, it was the first gig.<br /><br />The soundguy I used recommended getting the unit up higher, or rigging up an antenna system that's well off the floor.  I'll probably just re-rack them in a 2 space rack and get that off the floor on top of my other rack.  I hope it works out, since the price was right and the units are easy to setup. Will post an update when I use them again.
