Poor muffled sound quality.  I bought a cheap Behringer which sounds much better.  I used Mackie for years , until the mixers died.<br />If you are recording and concerned with fresh lively great sound quality, do not buy these Yamaha mixers.  Only one input is phantom power.<br />The compression does work OK.
