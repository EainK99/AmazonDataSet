Disappointing sound quality -- often harsh and tinny. Using the same signal sources and the same speakers, my old amplifier sounded a lot better than this. No way this is 1500 watts, either. And very few connections or features, not even an overall tone control or an output for a second pair of speakers. The subwoofer output doesn't seem to put out anything. Wish I'd returned it.
