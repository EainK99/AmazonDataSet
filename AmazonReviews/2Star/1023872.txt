So I received my amp today,very very quickly.just in time for my birthday.that part was great.now for the not so great.although this amp is the same model as advertised,this one is probably left over from the 80's.it has none of the features advertised.this amp was listed as (like new)laughable at best.I will play it but feel misled.I turned down a Marshall mc15 for 20 more bucks on Amazon.should've spent the$20!
