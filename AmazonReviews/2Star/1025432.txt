Right out of the plastic, the zipper was broken on the case. There was a slit in the material next to the teeth and so the pull had come off. No way to fix it so had to send it back. How this can even happen I cannot fathom. Must have been defective at the factory. The tuning hammer is ok but doesn't fit as snuggly as it should, so take your time and be careful when seating it on the pins. While this is not top of the line quality it seems to do the job.
