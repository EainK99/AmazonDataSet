This has not worked well for me. I wanted to use it for overdubbing recording with Audacity, but this is difficult, because the mixer does not separate the track playing from the track being recorded. (There is a work-around c/o Audacity: put the track playing back only into the left channel. But, then a bunch of post processing is neccesary to get a clean second track.) Following all the reccommended settings for Windows 7, and plugging an electrci guitar directly into the mixer, the mixer itself distorts at any but the very lowest volume. This means that Audacity only gets a tiny little signal. By the tme I amplified the signal in Audacity, there was a great deal of noise (guitar hum).<br />Also there is no support at all. I wrote to Alesis support with some of my problems, and did not hear back from them.<br />It seems like maybe it is only intended to be used with Cubase. The mixer came with &#34;Software Download Instructions&#34; for Cubase, which did not include the all important &#34;Download Access Code&#34; (it said that was sent in an email, but it wasn't). I had Cubase from another source, so I tried it with the mixer. Cubase could not see the mixer, in spite of trying several different drivers; I just got an &#34;Input not connected&#34; message.
