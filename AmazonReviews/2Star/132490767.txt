I really wanted to like this mic. Admittedly it does have good voice quality and picks up sound very easily. However, no matter what I tried I couldn't get rid of a rather annoying static sound that came from the mic. I spent around 4 or 5 hours researching and trying different things to fix it. I tried adjusting the levels to no avail. Even at 15(out of 100) the static was still very loud. My computer is plugged straight into an outlet so it's definitely grounded so that shouldn't have been causing any problems either. Just to see, I tried other outlets and it still produced static.I'll be investing in a higher quality mic.
