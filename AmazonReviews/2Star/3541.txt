I was looking for a cheaper Strat-style guitar for traveling. This had a nice body, nice neck, electronics inoperative, Had to return it.<br />Still, the body and neck seemed to be as well made as my Roadhouse Strat.<br />It is unfortunate, there were no others to exchange it with, and I had to just get a refund.
