I received it as advertised, with a couple of notable exceptions. Namely: 1) It came with an Ilok- great! but such wasn't stated, so I wasted money buying one as suggested by Amazon. 2) As a &#34;student version&#34;, verified student status is required to register and use the product - such not stated. This is a now obsolete version of ProTools I bought specifically so it could run on my current (soon to be obsolete) computer and system. I am borrowing a friends ProTools so I can continue my busy schedule of projects. My fault for trying to save a buck ($25 off the sticker price) and not knowing what &#34;student version&#34; really means. Apple and Digidesign's greed have a hand in this as well. I am frustrated to say the least. Oh well. Maybe I can find a student to buy it off me?
