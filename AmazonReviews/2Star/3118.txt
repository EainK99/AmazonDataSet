Two stars for the lights and minus 20 stats for the crappy glue that was supposed to keep them in place under the cabinets. What a joke! Might as well sell them as glueless so I don't waste time and hope it would actually stick. Too bad there are no better alternatives, you will need some superglue or double side tape.
