I got the Solo by mistake and tried it out - worked great in my pedal board!<br />But I wanted the XT's features, so I returned it, and got the Solo XT (used, no power supply).<br /><br />For some reason, Digitech decided to change the power connector for the XT, so instead of a standard pedal, you get a mutant monster that WILL NOT WORK with your 1-Spot pedal board power supply cable run. I will need some kind of adapter or a separate power supply just for this, only because Digitech made a very stupid decision. It will be hard to find, since Digitech doesn't provide any information to the size of the new connector, nor what 1-Spot converter to buy for it. This shows tremendous lack of respect for most guitarrists who have a pedal board.<br /><br />Thanks, Digitech! For terrible product design alone, you deserved 0 stars - but I gave you 2 for the functionality.
