Unless this is the only M-Audio device you plug into your Mac, you will certainly be disappointed. Even if this is the only M-Audio device you use, you will likely be disappointed that it doesn't perform like a 4x4 \\"Pro\\" device.<br /><br />I have a Fast Track Pro (FTP), and Mountain Lion, on a MacPro. It works OK, when it works. USB can't handle all of the audio channels on this device, so you either have to sacrifice bits per channel or channels.  Macs come with optical SPDIF, and this device has RCA SPDIF jacks, so you can't even use built-in SPDIF channels on a MacPro. The only workaround is sacrifice, accomplished by twiddling configuration settings in the Control Panel. Even this is not without unexpected headaches. Changing the channel/bits configuration in the control panel might mysteriously break recording or playback through the device (seems to work, except there's no signal), but you can usually unplug and replug it to get it to work again.<br /><br />Here's the stinger: Let's say, for argument's sake, you like the M-Audio device , and the brand, so you buy another (different) device with more recording channels (like a keyboard) which uses a different driver. When you install the new driver for the second device, it deactivates the FTP. If you reinstall the drivers for the FTP, it will deactivate the drivers for your other device. I guess M-Audio/Avid is telling you not to buy too many of their devices. This is a major engineering gaffe. It violates all of the assumptions about how USB devices are supposed to work.<br /><br />If Avid/M-Audio released better drivers to address some of the issues, I might be willing to give it 3 or 4 stars. If that happens, YMMV.
