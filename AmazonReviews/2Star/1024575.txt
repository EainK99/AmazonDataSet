The Microbrute is awesome!!!<br />I highly recommend it... Its the bag....<br /><br />Only 2 Stars because the bag in this package wears the white off the knobs and sliders of the Microbrute. The first time I removed it from the bag I noticed it.... kinda heartbreaking... I will upload pics when i get a chance..<br /><br />I only do light travel with the synth... Just store it in the bag and take it in my car... There is nothing I have done that would cause this.<br /><br />Not sure if the bag is poor quality or the micro brute's knobs and sliders are poor quality but this bag is not a good travel option for this synth..<br />(in my opinion)<br /><br />If your wondering about the sound quality of the Microbrute...<br />It sounds AWESOME.<br />Great 1st synth or travel synth.<br />Solid construction w/exception of the issue I mentioned above... again not sure if it's the bag or synth but it is a bad combination.<br /><br />See pics.. All knobs are like this.. Only been in the bag 5-6 times.
