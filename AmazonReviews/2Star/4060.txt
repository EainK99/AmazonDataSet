I'm good at most DIY projects, but this one was one tough cookie!<br /><br />This was supposed to be the focal point for my new home cinema, but I had to abandon this part of the project midstream.  By the time I began drilling holes and pulling the strands through, the rest of the fiber optic bundle began to unwind and became a giant &#34;eagles nest&#34; on my floor.  (Imagine having 300 fishing lines getting tangled at once!)  After spending several hours trying to detangle the pile of mess, I finally threw in the towel and surrendered.  Now I am out $400 plus materials and left with several dozen holes in my drywall that need to be repaired.<br /><br />There were no problems at all with the workmanship of the lamp and control unit.  I tested the lamp connection with one of the fiber bundles (still in the shrink wrap) when I received it so that I could see how it all works.  It worked well and the twinkling looked pretty cool.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, there were very few details, tips and instructions on how to properly install the kit.  There is a video on Wiedamark's website, but it is very basic and only shows a small scale installation.  I thought that it would be that simple, but fiber strands becoming tangled wasn't something that I had planned for. Having better customer education available would have definitely helped in this instance.
