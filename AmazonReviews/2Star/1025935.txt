Reducing this one star. The left ear bud has stopped working entirely. I know this happens a lot with headphones where one side stops working, but it's annoying as it renders the headphones useless.  Sound quality is good, but the flexible attachment that keeps it sturdy in your ear keeps falling out on both sides. I've lost it now and don't know where to get a replacement so can't use the headphones :(
