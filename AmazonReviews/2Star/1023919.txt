Ordered 427R, which looked gold/yellow, and got skin/translucent picks???<br />It looks like ALL Ultex picks are translucent skin, or black color, and the translucent skin picks are VERY HARD TO SEE.<br />If I dropped the skin pick on stage, I  would NEVER be able to find it!<br />As stated, Dunlop makes a black version of this pick, so introducing a pigment into the Ultex mix does not look like a problem.<br />Pick is small (jazz), Very stiff, and slippery; I like it.<br />Since this is one of  the smallest picks you can buy, it makes me wonder what Dunlop was thinking by also making it close<br />to impossible to see.
