(Hitlights Cree LED PAR20 7w) bulb [[ASIN:B007BTCME0 Hitlights Cree LED PAR20 Dimmable 7w Warm White Spot Lighting Bulb, Replacement of 50 Watt Recess Light or Track Lighting, UL Listed, 5 Year Warranty]] This is only a sort of question, about the authenticity of this bulb.  I always look for Cree LED bulbs, since Cree was the main push behind quality, reasonable cost and development of new uses for LED bulbs.  I ordered 2 types of what were supposed to be Cree bulbs from Amazon. This particular light has no indication at all on the bulb or the box that it is a Cree product, whereas the other type of LED that I ordered does have the Cree name, packaging, etc.  So, I have no idea what I have.  That is a problem for the consumer, since there are so many copies floating around.  It is not cheap, but I will try it and see if it lasts 5 years as it is warranted.
