Used this system for two weddings to play music from an ipod and use the wireless mic for vows.<br />The good - Ipod hook-up sound was acceptable and the battery pack worked well when not plugged in.<br />The ugly - (Note - you cannot change the frequency channel for the wireless mic). For the first wedding we had the unit outside and the microphone was within 10 feet of the unit. The unit cut in and out so much that we had to stop using it. What a let down. Thinking maybe it was because the unit was outside since it worked well testing it in my house at over 40 feet we had it inside the venue for the second wedding. This time the cutting in and out was worse. It would work for 2 seconds and then cut out for 10 seconds at a time. I could not believe it because it worked so well at the house. At this point we decided to just use it to play music and not for the wireless mic function.<br />I would not recommend this unit in any city environment. Home use it worked and still works well. Don't waste your money!
