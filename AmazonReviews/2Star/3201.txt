This is my second pair of the Gavin Harrison sticks. For my style of playing they work well. I prefer a little more weight and the balance is incredible.<br /><br />The issue is in the manufacture process they are dipped into a latex like material that should last a long time.<br /><br />The first pair did. I play 3X weekly and I got nearly a year out of them before I had shredded the grips. FYI I can still use them with the grip removed but the shock to the wrists is greatly increased.<br /><br />This pair arrived with the grips so thin that they bubbles and peeled the first time I practiced.<br /><br />There seems to be a huge inconsistency between runs and now I question if I will ever buy stocks online again. Too bad as I like them otherwise.
