I really wanted to like this pop filter, it seems like a good value, but the gooseneck is just horrible at the clamp side. It will not support the weight of the rest of the neck and the filter for holding the filter vertically from the bottom. I was able to rig it up where it held OK from over the top, but it is a less than ideal setup. For the price I can make it work, but I would prefer a MUCH stiffer gooseneck.<br /><br />It also then calls in to question the longevity of the gooseneck, if I reposition it too much will it fail prematurely? I just can't feel confident about the quality of this product.
