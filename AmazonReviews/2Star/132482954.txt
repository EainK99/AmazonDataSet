I have a Mac and it was really hard to get this up and running on my macbook. Also I had to do some research on how to troubleshoot it since there is nothing in the manual on it but with some time and frustration I got it up and working. Even then I am still having trouble with the gain since it is either hypersensitive or very muffled. I am just going to sell this and get a pro board with a pre amp and a meter instead for $100 more. I would say pass this one up and save $100 more for the board.
