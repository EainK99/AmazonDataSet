Bought because of the good reviews and affordable price. The attached photo is the quality of the case straight out of the box. note the 7cm by 3 cm gap. It would cost me shipping to return the item and it's better than the duffel bag style case we have. I would not have purchased this case if I was able to see it's faulty closure. Spend a little more somewhere else is my advice.  The return policy is you pay to ship and if they determine it isn't in brand new condition you get a further deduction in your refund. I determined it was too much work to return but I am not happy with this purchase. It will protect the body of the cello nicely for 2 stars.
