I don't mind if a company wants a subtle logo on their product, though I prefer not to pay for a product and then have the shill for the company.  But considering these stands are most likely going to be used for a performance, an enormous, mirrored  ON STAGE billboard plus a separate bar code sticker - is not acceptable.<br /><br />But what's really offensive, is that while the tacky mirrored banner peels off, it leaves a residue with an adhesive power rivaled only by Spiderman.  Really good to have if a performer wants to pick up the stand only to need it surgically removed later.  Crazy Glue isn't this good.<br /><br />But let's assume a little nail polish or battery acid addresses that issue, the bar code sticker is a whole other matter as it appears to be permanently branded to the stand. I may need a propane torch to remove it.  Can't use a blade or the finish might get scratched.  Hopefully the manufacturer will use something akin to a Post-it next time.<br /><br />The clutch seems a tad weak and is plastic - only time will tell if that holds up.<br /><br />On the plus side, the base seems sturdy and the threads are deep and fine, so the connection appears very sturdy.  Just don't pick it up the stand.
