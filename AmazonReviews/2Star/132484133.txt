This gig stand is portable but not safe for my instruments.  The foam covering can (and does) slip down so that the back of the instrument is against bare metal at the top of the stand.  Had to get rid of it and now use bigger gig stands which 'hang' the instrument by the head stock and cushion the sound box with padding which does not move or allow damage.
