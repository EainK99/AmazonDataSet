Worked pretty well except for Low E on my bass could never get locked in for some reason.  Always flat then sharp, too high too low, back and forth constantly.  Had to tune down from A.<br /><br />Battery ran out after 5 months and new Energizer batteries don't work.  Futzed with it for an hour and never worked.  No returns or exchanges so.....<br /><br />Don't buy is my recommendation.
