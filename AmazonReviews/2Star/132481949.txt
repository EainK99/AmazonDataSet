I thought I was getting the model with the adjustable buckle on it, but that's the pro model I realize that now. The biggest drawback with this basic model is that the tension can be either too strong so it bends the strings out of tune, or too little so there's fret buzz. It is sheer luck if the pressure is just right. But it's better than nothing, and if somebody on stage desperately needs a capo at a show, if it will be a lifesaver, I can give it away with no second thoughts. Keep it, let it remind you to bring your good capo next time.
