Pros: This karaoke machine is great machine for the price you are paying. The 2- microphone option is really nice for gatherings, and the aux cord is awesome. You can use any karaoke songs on YouTube for karaoke if you have the cord.<br />Cons: As soon as I opened the machine, the CD player did not work. The screen was blank blue, the cd did not spin, none of the play buttons worked, and even the cd the machine came with didn't even work! It was quite disappointing.<br /><br />Overall, good machine for a cheap price, but could use MAJOR improvements.
