This product does what it says it will; it holds a guitar securely on a microphone stand.  If it were $30, I would give it 5 stars, but for $60, I expected better quality.  Here's what I don't like:<br /><br />1. You have to screw the device on the mic stand first, then mount the guitar while it's on the stand.  Since one of the target demographics for this product are people with physical limitations, this can be difficult.  I bought this for a friend with a spinal cord injury, and he has trouble mounting the guitar by himself.  You really need a third hand.<br /><br />2. The device tilts on one axis, not two, so you can't adjust the tilt towards you.  It turned out to be an okay angle for my friend, but I am obese and it was a bit awkward when I tried it.<br /><br />3. To adjust the tilt, you have to take the guitar off the device, use the provided allen wrench, remove a screw, adjust the tilt, replace the screw, and reattach the guitar.  Both of these issues could be resolved with either a spring-loaded pin or a tension screw with a knob (similar to many mic stands) on the back of the device.<br /><br />4. The allen wrench is taped to the device.  Taped!  How hard would it have been to fashion a slot or some kind of snap thing to hold it?<br /><br />5. The whole thing feels flimsy.  I have no idea how durable it is or isn't, but it feels cheaply made.<br /><br />Bottom line:  It does what it says it does, and I would buy it again, but only because it is the only option.  However, the quality needs to improve or the price needs to drop in order for this to be a good value.<br /><br />Edit:  After three months, one of the ends started coming loose from the strap.  We sewed it back on, but who knows how long that will hold.  I cringe thinking that my friend's thousand dollar guitar may hit the ground because this manufacturer didn't want to spend an extra buck or two to provide a quality strap.  I dropped the rating from three stars to two for this reason.
