We ordered several packages of these & one package came with 4 Lefts & 2 Rights.  This means that we can't use it at all, because my husband only makes acoustic (6) string guitars & you have to have 3 Lefts & 3 Rights.  All packages only came with 10 screws & they are supposed to have 12 screws each package.  Because of this we are having trouble using them at all, because all screws must match perfectly!  Overall we are very disappointed with this product & will not order again or recommend this product to anyone.
