loose pegs and bad strings, (violin did not sound well after tuning and adjustment still did not sound right) we had it looked at by professionals in the area and they said it would cost more than just buying a new one. Very disapointed, sending it back. The violin and the rest of the packaging looks really nice, but just unfortunate that it didn't work. We know we paid little for it (new student)and didn't expect it to sound amazing, but at least it should be decent not something that does not work at all.
