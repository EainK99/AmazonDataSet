I have the same problem that a lot of people have with the tuning pegs. I thought I was gonna be tuning forever with this thing. I played an acoustic cello and never had this problem, not to mention the God awful scream sound it makes that practically makes you jump out of your skin. The headphones are horrible so I used my own but it just made the screaming sound more intense...oh wait, that was ME screaming out of aggravation on top of the cello screaming! 0_0 I was SO excited about getting an electric cello, but now I feel like an idiot for this purchase because it's becoming a nightmare between having to buy a good set of strings and a good horsehair bow. I'm so bummed out it's not even funny. =/
