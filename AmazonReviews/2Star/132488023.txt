It really sucks to get something like this that has a number of usable FX (especially considering the price), but not be able to use many of them because there is no volume control. Some of the patches have a volume parameter but many that need it don't.<br /><br />It even has one very necessary feature: Analog bypass. Inserting the pedal into my guitar signal chain turned my warm full tone a bit cold and trebly. Enable the Analog Bypass and my tone was put back to normal during M5 FX off mode.<br /><br />Knowing that, it's obvious that the tone of the FX would be a little bit cold. They were, but they were still very usable.<br /><br />I was very interested in the synth and filter FX in this unit. And they were very cool. But when I turn them on my volume went up significantly. Seemed two times louder when using the very awesome \\"Synth O matic\\" with 'Mix' parameter at max. In band practice it nearly blew everyone's ears off.<br /><br />I have searched and can't find any way to control the volume of the unit when using any FX models that don't have a volume control parameter. There really needs to be either a volume on every FX model or at least a master volume to make this a keeper. Preferably both. I'd pay another $30 just to have the extra trim pot that controls the volume for each FX model individually.<br /><br />Another bummer is that the \\"Autosave\\" mode doesn't work. Adjust a parameter change to a different effect and come back and that parameter reverts to it's original value.<br /><br />This thing just isn't usable for a live situation.<br /><br />Unless someone has a work-a-round for this volume issue I'll have to return it. Work-a-round can't be buying another pedal to control this.
