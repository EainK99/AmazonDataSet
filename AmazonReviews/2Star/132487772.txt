From their inadequate description of what works with these mics<br />and NOT, I purchased items I cannot use on my equipment.  I had the ports<br />but needed USB ends to do what I thought I could use these for.<br /><br />I think it is still expensive and hard to get what is needed to do clear recordings<br /> .... walk-around battery pack mics with compact amps.
