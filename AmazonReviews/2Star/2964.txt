I does a good job of holding down the strings and looks nice enough, but it digs into my palm when I squeeze to reposition it (seriously, it's not a cool feeling).  The top part should be longer, as to avoid this.  If you have tiny hands, maybe this won't be an issue for you and then this would be a great deal!<br /><br />Update:  I found my old Capo and realize now that it's not the length of the top part that's the problem...it's the SHAPE.  Perhaps it's personal preference, but I find this shape (see pic) much more pleasant to squeeze!
