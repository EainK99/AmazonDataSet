I have a fairly standard-sized microphone -- a Shure Beta 58 -- and it kinda, sorta fits.  It's too small to really slide the microphone into it.  I am able to snap the microphone into the holder, but only at the very base, at the smallest part of the microphone.  If I try to slide it up more it just pops out.  It's definitely in there tight, but it's also cantilevered out pretty far.  For $3 I can't really complain I guess.  But it would be nice if it was a little bigger and allowed a more balanced mounting of the microphone.
