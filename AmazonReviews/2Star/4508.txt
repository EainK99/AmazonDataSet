I have been an Audio-Technica fan for years, but this last one I got shorted out in just a few months. I use it on my desktop and on my phone, just a little bit of switching and it's not even usable 5 months after I got it, it's shorting constantly. AT makes good phones but their wires have gone to s*** if this is any representation.
