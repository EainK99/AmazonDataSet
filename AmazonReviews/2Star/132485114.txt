Purchased in March 2013, this cord started not working in September of 2013.  It was used 1-2 times a week and was surely not the performance I would have liked from a Fender name.  That being said, we also have one we're using to connect a keyboard and that one is still working fine.  It must be the movement on the guitar that cause the other one to fail...right before a performance too!  :(
