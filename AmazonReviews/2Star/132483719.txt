I wanted something to help boost my voice for a dinner presentation. I was promised a Monday delivery but did not get it until Wedenesday, the day I needed it. The headset did not fit comfortably so I had to hold  it in my hand. The waist band was awkward so I clipped the unit to my belt. I could have handled all the physical annoyances if It had worked well but I got feedback every few sentences and gave up after about 5 minutes. If I had time to practice, I might have figured how to adjust it. Freecycled it, not even worth the postage and trip to the post office to return it.
