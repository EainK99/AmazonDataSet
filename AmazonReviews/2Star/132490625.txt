I bought this microphone for home studio use, so it did not see any abuse. Within a year, two of the soldered wires became disconnected, including the hard to access connection beneath the cap. Shure used to be rugged, I'm not sure why there has been a huge drop in quality. I can no longer recommend this mic as I would have in the past, look elsewhere.
