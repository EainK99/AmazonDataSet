The only good thing I can say about this is that it did not take the MONTH that Amazon said it would take to get here.  However, once it was here, it did not work.  How does a screwdriver not work, you ask. Well, when you put the screwdriver in the screw, and turn the handle, you EXPECT the entire screwdriver to turn as a single unit.  You do NOT expect the handle to turn while the bottom part does nothing.<br /><br />Modified:  The seller did contact me to send me a replacement.  I'll update again if I get a screwdriver that works.
