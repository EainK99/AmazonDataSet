I received the product described as &#34;like new&#34;. There had obviously been an issue with the mini USB port as the previous owner had scratched the female connector right off of the board, leaving an empty connector socket and rendering the device unusable. Very localized incident but as I've heard of troubles with the port from other reviews, this is worrying to any potential buyer of a working unit!
