I read the other reviews before I bought this item, so I knew there was a chance it might not fit my stand, which is a Radioshack brand I've had for years.  Not a deal-breaker.  The package arrived in a timely manner, but upon opening the outer box, I could see that this was NOT a new unit, but one someone else had returned, because the manufacturer box was open.  Also, there was no instruction sheet, and no parts list.  One of the set screws for tightening the unit was completely missing.<br /><br />But, determined to get my money's worth, rather than send the unit back, pay for return shipping and wait for a replacement or refund, and pay more for a different unit from elsewhere, I gritted my teeth and went to the hardware store, bought a replacement screw and a length of copper pipe which would fit inside the bottoms of the extension once I cut it into two lengths with a hacksaw.  Once that was done, I slid the pipes inside the ends of my Radioshack stand after cutting holes in the ends of the rubber caps, and after tightening everything down, was good to go.<br /><br />However, I might mention that the unit does NOT look like the photo on the manufacturer box, or this amazon ad, which shows two plastic ends that hold the second keyboard in place.  The actual unit had two plain rectangular pieces of metal screwed into the ends, which makes it functional, but not esthetically pleasing.<br /><br />This unit is functional and sturdy enough for the midi keyboard I have placed on it, but I wouldn't trust it to hold a larger, heavier keyboard, which is what I have on the bottom tier.  I don't think I would buy this again.
