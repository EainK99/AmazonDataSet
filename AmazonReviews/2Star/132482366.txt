So, yes, the headphones sound great, they are fairly comfortable (though the headband could be a little cushier--the top of my head starts to hurt after extended use)and aesthetically they can't be beat (Monster Beats... gross, gag me with a spoon) BUT--there is one downside that makes me wish I had returned my pair when I had the chance (no one's fault but my own, I know, I know, woe is me):<br /><br />These things are creaky!! When you're wearing them, for example, with no music playing (why?? I don't know) you need only flex your jaw muscles, or tilt your head IN THE SLIGHTEST to hear the loud creaking of plastic, seemingly coming from where the can meets the headband (I'm just guessing at the appropriate terminology here).<br /><br />Once I noticed it, I couldn't NOT notice it, even when listening to music loudly. The only way to avoid it is to keep your head completely still--which is not realistic, ESPECIALLY if you are hoping to walk somewhere while listening to music, which I like to do. Now, when walking, I find myself concentrating more on keeping my head stationary then on the music. Sorry Shure, these are some sexy headphones, but I can't recommend them.
