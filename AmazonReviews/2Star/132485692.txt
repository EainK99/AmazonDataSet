This is not a quality instrument in any sense of the word! It does not keep a tune, had loose tuners when I received it, and there are visible chips and cracks in the body of the guitar. The sound is dull and lifeless, even with the addition of new strings, the sound remained the same.<br /><br />This is really just a toy and should not toted as a real musical instrument. Yamaha has definitely dropped the ball on this one! A really bad product with no visible signs of quality control. It even has glue sticking out in the neck and body of the guitar. A true piece of junk!<br /><br />We also had to replace the gig bag, as the zipper kept ripping more and more of the inside liner. And, the tuner never worked!<br /><br />Do not purchase this instrument or your child will lose all interest in learning how to play the guitar! Instead, look at other, more reputable dealers of beginner instruments. There are many to chose from, so do your research and buy a quality instrument from a company that cares about producing a real musical instrument!
