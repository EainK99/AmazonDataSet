I was very disappointed... I don't know how to explain it other than nothing I listened to felt right in these headphones. I returned them and bought a pair of Sony MDR-V6's.<br />A bit higher in price but worth it in my opinion. I own a pair of Sennheiser HD 280's that are also spectacular headphones.
