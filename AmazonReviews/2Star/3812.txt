I bought this Microphone Suspension in order to, &#34;Suspend&#34;, my AT2020+ Condenser Microphone. I thought it would work appropriately but unfortunately, It does not. I believe it's not capable of holding the mic up. I have it latched onto my desk and no matter how often, and how hard I tighten the knobs, It continues to gradually sink and lower (sag). Maybe I received a faulty suspension? I did not want the hassle of returning it. So I keep it laying on top of my monitor as a crutch in order to be held up.
