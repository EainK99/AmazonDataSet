Before you buy this you should be aware of what I consider to be a fairly major problem.<br />I have been only moderately successful getting the guitar in tune. For the first month I was able to get the guitar in tune, but it almost immediately fell back out of tune. At first I thought it was due to the tremolo, or maybe just new strings needing to be broken in. After the guitar became &#34;un-tunable&#34; I changed the strings thinking they were just cheap, but that does not appear to be the answer to my problem. At last I have come to the conclusion that it is just not going to be a guitar that will stay in tune. The best I can hope for is to tune it every 15 minutes, and hope I can get the strings to at least be in the ballpark.<br />Now after I got that off my chest, I must say that everything was in the box, just like it was advertised!<br />The amp works well for the intended purpose, the tuner works fine (on my guitar), and the guitar itself is very pretty!<br />My son really liked the DVD that came with the guitar and seems to have learned some things from it.<br />If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this guitar. I read a LOT of reviews before I picked this guitar, and most of the reviews were very positive, so maybe you will be luckier than me. But the bottom line is, the price sucked me in, and sometimes you get what you pay for!!
