I really wanted to like this pedal. It is compact, well made, and online buzz was all positive. I don't think that it's necessarily bad, but it wasn't what I expected. The biggest problem is that it seems like the fuzz knob has little to no functionality: when all the way down it is pretty clean, but by the time you get the knob to 10:00 it seems maxed out, and the remaining 3/4 of the knob turn does nothing. It leaves a lot of functionality out of what I was hoping and made it hard to get it to play with my other pedals.<br /><br />If the desire is for a full-bore wall of fuzz then this will do it, but it does so at the expense of note definition. It may be a great pedal for others, but I just want them to know what they are getting into.
