First off I am a drummer of many years I bought this set for my 3 year old to get started on and well, the pedals, stands and cymbals are nothing but junk cheap products. As for the toms snare and kick decent nothing to be excited about. The heads are rubbish very disappointed. I will suggest spend a little more and get the Ludwig set, same set up 100% better quality. If you don't care how they sound and how long they will last then go for these but I am extremely disappointed in my purchase.
