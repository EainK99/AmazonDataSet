This rug serves well for all intents and purposes, but when playing on a nice studio's hardwood floor, I have to lay another rug beneath it to protect it.  On day 1 I scratched up the wood floor through the rug with my hi hat pedal's spikes after an hour session.  It's very noticeable.<br /><br />Luckily there is a throw rug in the studio I can put underneath it, but if I had known this before purchasing, I would have probably gone with a different drum rug.  Hope this helps.
