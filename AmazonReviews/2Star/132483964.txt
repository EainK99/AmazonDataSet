I ordered these thinking I was going to get wood handled brushes as pictured, but instead got plastic handled ones...  Not a fan of the plastic handle feel and the bristles are too flimsy for my tastes.  Just okay for striking things but not too good for jazz brushing due to the low volume and lack of \\"wash\\" sound.  Maybe I was sent the wrong ones? Still trying to figure that out...
