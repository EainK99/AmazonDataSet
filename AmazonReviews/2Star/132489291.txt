Overall, this is a nice case (unless you need to walk around with it a lot).<br /><br />Pros:<br />Durable<br />Protective<br />Lots of storage space<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bulky<br />Heavy<br />Difficult to walk with, especially up and down stairs<br /><br />This case comes with backpack straps and a shoulder strap, so you can carry it a few different ways. However, it is so bulky and heavy that it is extremely uncomfortable to carry it using the shoulder strap or backpack straps (or even the regular attached handle). I am a college student, and I often need to lug my horn around campus. After my first two weeks of starting, I had to buy a new case because I didn't want to deal with it anymore.<br /><br />If you're not worried about the heaviness and bulkiness, don't be afraid to buy this case. It has served me well for years and has never done damage to my horn, even after dropping it down the stairs once.
