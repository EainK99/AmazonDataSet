I have experience playing high quality tongue drums so I was disappointed in this drum.  It feels and sounds more like a decent quality toy tongue drum.  No nicks or scratches, but not a satiny smooth  finish as it appears in the photo.  The metal is relatively thin and light weight and and feels a little uneven to the hand.  Also, I think the metal would dent very easily.  The resonance is disappointing.  I couldn't produce an udu sound by cupping  the sound hole, as on a hang drum.  Difficult to express individual notes -  overtones overly interfere with melody.  okay for personal meditation or beginner tongue drum...sounds a little tinny instead of full an resonant. Though it slightly resembles a hang drum in shape,  I certainly was not expecting the hang drum level of quality and sound, but even so....this drum sounds inferior to other comparably priced and heavier, sturdier tongue drums.  I think the seller should give a much more detailed description.  On a positive note, it arrived much faster than advertised - packaged with empty water bottles above and below for  cushioning - so I have to give the seller kudos for inventive recycling.  Very expensive to return to Israel so buyer beware and be sure you want this drum before you purchase it.  .
