There were two basic reasons for returning the clarinet:<br /><br />- The ligature slipped away from the mouthpiece even being tied up till the end;<br /><br />- The reed did not produce any sound.<br /><br />The music teacher strongly recommended to return the instrument because of<br />serious defects. The boy just started to learn to play and was excited but he is very frustrated now.
