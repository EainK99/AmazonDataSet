Contrary to other positive reviews (which guided my decision to purchase these), I am pretty disappointed in the fit/comfort of these headphones. I didn't expect overwhelming audio performance for the price, but the audio aspects more than acceptable for the price. However, what I do find unpleasant is the fit - you expect fatigue after extended wear, but these hurt my ears and head after 3-5 minutes of usage. I have extended the straps to make them as large as possible, but they remain very tight and uncomfortable.
