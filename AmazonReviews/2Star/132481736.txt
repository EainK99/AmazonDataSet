The stand puts my Yamaha P-105 awfully high for me, at 5'2&#34;. I expected to be able to sit in a chair and reach the keys. I adjusted the stand up even higher to work with a medium height counter stool for my 6' tall friends, and that worked for them. The stand  does support the piano and you get leg room. If you want to stand and play, it would be fine. Tip:  A couple strips of rubberized shelf liner under the piano holds the piano securely on the stand. If I played a lot, which I do not, I would look for another solution.  I would love to make this work. If anybody has another suggestion, please let me know.
