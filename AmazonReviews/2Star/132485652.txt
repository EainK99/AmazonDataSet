I recently started to film my project and started to use this microphone.  It recorded me for 30 min and after that it stopped recording my voice.  All I heard is static noises.  I tried to change battery, but it wasn't due to the battery.  I tried to adjust the antenna, but it didn't do any good.  Tried to follow the instruction from the manual, but again nothing changed.  I'm very disappointed with this low quality product.  I haven't had time to return it.  I will soon.
