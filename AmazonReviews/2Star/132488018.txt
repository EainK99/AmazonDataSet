I bought two Amplugs, first the Classic Rock model, then the AC30 model.  When an Amplug is working, it's a neat little toy, but doesn't give you much variety in sound.  The Classic Rock model is a little more flexible, but the AC30's \\"Tone\\" control knob is a joke, it doesn't so much change the tone as it just muffles the sound.  But they're fun to play with.  The problem is they seem very cheaply made.  I figured I'd break one of these things before the electronics inside gave out, given the pretty cheap plastic construction, but right around the 90 day mark of me owning each one, they gave out.  The Classic Rock model just turned into interference mid song, and whenever I plug it in that's all it is, static.  The AC30 model appears to have just lost power entirely, the light doesn't come on or anything.  And before anybody asks if I checked the batteries, I bought some AAA rechargable batteries specifically for my Amplugs, and they are charged and in good working order, and I did try other batteries to see if they were defective.  It's the Amplugs.  Luckily these things aren't too expensive, but they are priced too high for how disposable they apparently are.  I might chalk up the Classic Rock model going out to over-playing, I got a lot of time out of it.  I used the AC30 model much less, maybe played a couple of hours with it total, so there's no excuse for it going out in such a short time.  I barely used it.<br /><br />Bottom line is they're neat, but not well made.  They appear to be JUST well made enough to last past the Amazon return deadline.  I'm sure people have had some for longer that are still in working order, maybe I just had bad luck with the two I bought.  But having had two give out like that seems a little odd.
