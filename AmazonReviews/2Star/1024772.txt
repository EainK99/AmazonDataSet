I guess you get what you pay for. I used it recently when I spoke in front of a group of about 20 people in a room with lousy acoustics. The first 2 minutes or so, I had the mike turned on, the second couple of minutes, I turned it off. Then I surveyed the group. Almost 100% stated that there was no change in the sound. I will keep it, but really doubt if I'll ever have any real use for it. I certainly would not recommend it.
