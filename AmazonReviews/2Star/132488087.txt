Ours was out of tune when we bought it. However, we couldn't send it back because we didn't notice that it was out of tune before we had used permanent marker to cover up the purple color of the edges of the harmonica. Why would we care about the color? Well, we assumed it would be black, we have 2-year-old twins and already owned a harmonica. When this one came, they both obviously wanted the new shiny purple harmonica. Oh man! The chaos was nuts!
