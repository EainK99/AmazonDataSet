On Amazon site, it states that this fine tuner fits 1/8 - 1/2 size violin. I purchased this for a new 1/2 size violin. Once I installed one the them on the violin, it has no room for the tuning arm to move, which missed the purpose of having fine tuner. I ended up  installed them on my kid's 1/4 size violin. They barely fit 1/4 violin. Very little room for the tuning arm to move.
