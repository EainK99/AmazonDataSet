I am blacking out all the hardware on my Fender Jazz bass. I ordered these thinking they would be a direct replacement. The mounting screw holes do not line up on my model year 2000 Mexican made Fender Jazz Bass. My bass is currently with a friend who does luthier work on the side (his family owned a music store). I did not want to drill new holes in my headstock, so I had to have someone else take it to do it. Hopefully he can mount them so I am not out the money and have to buy another set of more expensive tuners. Also, I noticed when I took the tuners out of the package for the second time to show my friend doing the work, the black had ALREADY started to chip off of one of the tuner's base. Just want to get that information out there for anyone else thinking about getting these.
