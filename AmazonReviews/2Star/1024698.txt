Why are SO MANY of the reviews for these pickups on this page for OTHER pickups, especially Noiseless - which these ARE NOT?!<br /><br />I've had a bad experience with my set of Deluxe Drive Strat pickups. They are hot, yes, they are true single coil, yes. But even I was SHOCKED at the amount of hum these things make in high gain settings and with distortion pedals!! I mean, hell - I've got Strats with Fat 50s single coils and Texas Specials and even a set of Toneriders - all true single coil. But NONE of them come close to the almost shrieking hum these guys make! And in overdirve, the bridge pickup is so ice-pick sharp it will tear you head off. If you want pickups that can do anything, get the Fender Vintage or Hot Noiseless. Or better yet: the Dimarzio Area Set or Injectors.
