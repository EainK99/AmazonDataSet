This Bag is too small to hold the: Pro Tec F3E Big Band Sheet Music Folder. After purchasing several of these music folders for our group, I purchased this Music Bag to hold my new folder. Although this bag will hold a standard size music folder, it is too small to hold and zip the bag when attempting to utilize my new folder, which is also a Pro Tec Product. This bag needs to be larger and wider to serve the purpose which I purchased it for. Very Disappointing!!!
