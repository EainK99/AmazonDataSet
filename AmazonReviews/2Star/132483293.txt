I purchased the Morley ABY splitter so I could use my amp (Marshall DSL – only one input) to drive two instruments and so I could move quickly from my guitar to my steel. My ‘2’ rating of the Morley splitter is due to its inability to handle a wireless input source properly. When you’re using the A and B switching option (both instruments are hot) and one of the two instruments is wireless, attenuation/volume loss is in the neighborhood of 80% for the instrument connected via a traditional instrument cable. Also, when using two instruments, both connected via traditional instrument cable inputs, and you’re using the same A and B switching option, there is still a noticeable reduction in volume (imo: 10% loss). From what I can tell, when using two instruments, both connected via traditional instrument cable inputs, and you’re using the A or B switching option, there is no noticeable loss of volume or tone. I’ve performed extensive troubleshooting just to make sure these issues were not caused by a faulty cable or instrument (single coil vs humbucker, etc.). So, I cycled three of my guitars (American Deluxe Strat – single & double coils; Les Paul; Peavey PowerSlide lap steel – also single/double coil) through the different input channels. All scenarios produced the same result as mentioned above.
