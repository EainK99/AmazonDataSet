The sound may be great but they are not for me. Reasons:<br />- High pressure on the head is annoying<br />- Cable way too long<br />- Don't need the larger connector, also has a screwed in type 3.5mm connector but that connector won't fit through my iPhone case while<br />a standard 3.5mm connector does.<br />- They are simply too large and cumbersome for me.<br />- Bought a set of BOSE AE2 audio headphones and prefer then many times over the big audio technica headphones
