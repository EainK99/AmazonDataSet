I am a former performance major and semi-professional trumpet player getting back into the habit of playing. My old Bach Strad needs some significant work to get it back in playing shape (as do I!), so I bought this trumpet based on reviews to get me through until my Bach is ready. I do not recommend this trumpet, even at the very palatable price. The sound is okay, but many notes are extremely out of tune (particularly the high E, and the low D and C# are so bad that even kicking out the 3rd valve slide doesn't fully fix the problem). Also, the third and especially second valves are quite sticky even after washing and oiling a few times. These issues make the horn extremely difficult to play, and I would imagine would be even more frustrating for a beginner who is not aware that playing should not really be THIS difficult.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's a good looking trumpet at a very enticing price, but the old adage \\"you get what you pay for\\" certainly applies in this case.
