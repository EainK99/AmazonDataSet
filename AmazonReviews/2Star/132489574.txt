I got this a few weeks ago.  I messed around with it long enough to know I don't have a regular need for it.  It sounded cool in an experimental kind of way, and I may find a use for it some day, but seemed to create noise at the lower frequency notes (...and that could just be my amp) and produced a lot of sounds (at various settings) that I thought were terrible.  As for the effect itself, I just found it hard to use it in a predictable way.  It was fun to play around with but every time I've tried to work with it, I find myself shutting it off to get to the sound I am going for.  I knew it would sound electronic, that's it's key trait, but just found it making things sound muddy, especially with the fuzz setting.  I don't like it's distortion feature at all.  I will continue to play around and figure out if I have a use for it but it will take a lot of effort on my part.  Not the kind of pedal that \\"out-of-the-box\\" blows you away, but not a terrible thing to have either if you have a niche use for this kind of sound.
