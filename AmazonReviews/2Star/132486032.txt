I purchased this product for a teen center that I run in Alaska.<br /><br />I wanted something for the dance floor.<br /><br />I use it on stand alone/sound active mode and the Gobos don't have enough movement. They tend to stick together and stack up on top of each other in the center of the floor.<br /><br />Save your money if you want something that doesn't look cheesy and lame.
