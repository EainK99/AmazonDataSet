I really wanted to like this product...  Once the phone is connected to the station, everything works great and the speaker quality is good. Unfortunately, connecting the phone to the station is a real pain (I use an iPhone 5). Unlike most Bluetooth headsets that use a 4-digit key in combination with a paired device, the phone station does not remember the connection and needs to be \\"re-paired\\" each time the iPhone got disconnected.  I purchased several of these stations for my office and have one of them right on my desk. I leave my office at least 10 times per day and I usually take my phone with me.  Whenever I return to my office, I need to go through the cumbersome Bluetooth pairing process again (and most of the time, it takes several attempts to reconnect).  For users that need the station only once in a while, this may not be a problem. But users that are looking to replace a regular speaker-phone (which I thought this thing was designed for), the constant re-connects are very inconvenient.
