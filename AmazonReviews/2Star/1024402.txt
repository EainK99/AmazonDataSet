I bought this hoping to replace an IKEA 10 Watt halogen clamp lamp which is extremely bright but like all halogen products extremely hot (and therefore dangerous).  Plus the bulb life on halogens is not that great and the IKEA units have giant power supplies that are awkward.<br /><br />The Donner unit has three types of power which seems exciting but unless it is a blackout, I would only use the wall-unit USB.  Anyways, I clamped it to a shelf approximately two feet above my head where I sit in a recliner chair.  The light from the 9 LEDs is just enough to illuminate the page given that I have an adjacent floor lamp just 3 feet to my left.<br /><br />I think it is fine for a desk lamp to illuminate your desk to see where your mouse and coffeecup are.  But to use as a supplemental reading light, it is insufficient.  I would add it does not have build qualities or heft I would expect to see in a lamp listed at $55.  It is perpetually half priced on Amazon so as to make it seem like a deal but it is really comparable to any below $25 LED lamp set.
