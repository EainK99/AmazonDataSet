Really should be 2.5.. These are OK for the price in all honesty, but why not save a bit more and go for something nicer?<br /><br />1) I don't have an exceptionally large head/ears, but this thing was uncomfortable after about only 20 minutes.<br />2) Part of the frame ended up breaking after a couple of months!<br />3) I don't recall mine coming with a carrying case of any sort.<br />4) Bass was slightly boomy for my taste and there was constant soft hissing in the background.<br /><br />Now I have Sony mdr 7506- very comfortable studio quality headphones, but for drummers you might want something with more isolation from outside noise. Try looking at some audio technicas under a hundred bucks and if you really play loud I suggest you check out Direct Sound! Racer X (with Paul Gilbert) uses Direct Sounds frequently!
