FM tuner has untuned front end, extremely sensitive to overload from nearby strong in-band signals, especially at low end of FM band. Auto-scan does not record actual stations if any other strong in-band signals present. These limitations could have been avoided with better design costing only a few dollars more. User interface is flashy but poor, some functions cannot be addressed w/o remote control, e.g., manually adding stations to memory. The user documentation is minimal, very poor—some feature descriptions are incorrect for this model..
