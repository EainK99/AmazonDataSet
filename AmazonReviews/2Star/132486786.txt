Honestly I don't know much about Violins and was interested in learning to play them. So, I found the cheapest one I could find with the best reviews and went for it. Sadly, I think I made a mistake nor do I believe I'll be learning Violin with this.<br /><br />Quality:<br />This is the main reason I am so disappointed with this item. I've been around guitars, bass, etc.. and I know what a instrument should feel like and how it should be crafted. The crafting of this product is just plain terrible. The tuning knobs at the top didn't even fit into the holes of the violin, they just kind of sat there. Also, everything on this violin (that's black in the picture) is made from a very shoddy quality of plastic. It's very thin, flimsy, and overall feels like almost toyish quality. The only good things quality wise were everything else but the violin. The case is gorgeous I must say, but it's hypocritical to me considering it's protecting something of such low value. Maybe you're paying for the case? I don't know but either way it's not worth it.<br /><br />Notes:<br />- I never even got to properly use this item because when attempting to tune the knobs (which are bloody awful) the string popped out and snapped a part off the base as well. Literally, the whole thing fell apart due to a single attempt of tuning it. Not even worth my time to ship back or get fixed because I'd end up losing more money than this thing is worth.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Please don't buy it. Rent a Violin from the local store if you have to but don't buy this. It's like buying a store's value brand. You buy it for the price knowing full and well how bad it's going to be, but you get it anyway. Don't make that mistake with this item..please.
