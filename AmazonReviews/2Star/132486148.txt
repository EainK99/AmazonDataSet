This violin is great for kids - you know, they beg you for a violin, but you know it's a passing fad, and yet they have been good enough and done chores and been helpful around the house or kind to their siblings, etc., and so you want to reward them?  That's what this violin is for. It is NOT good enough for schools, let alone real violin lessons. The body is made of very cheap materials. The 'tuners' are cheap.  The knobs for tightening the strings and the strings themselves are extremely cheap in price and quality. If you tighten it (to tune it) too much, it will break. The violin cannot properly be tuned, because of this. The violin does not hold a tune either. You must tune it every 2-4 songs. Rosin is cheap. Bow is cheap. Case is ok, but still cheap. The extra E string was not shipped with our violin. Instead we got a note saying that it was not available and they would ship it as soon as possible.<br /><br />The sound is flat. The E string cannot. cannot. be tuned up to the middle E on a piano.<br /><br />Overall - like I said - a very cheap, inexpensive violin.  Basically think of this as a \\"high end toy\\".  If you think of it that way, you'll be satisfied.<br /><br />I am a pianist myself, and our son plays guitar, and our oldest played violin in middle school, and we had to rent a real violin for that. I know the sound and quality it should have and am very familiar with music in its various forms. This is not an \\"ok\\" violin by any stretch of the imagination.  But it will be great for a kid to PLAY with.
