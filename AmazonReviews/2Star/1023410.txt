I am very disappointed in the product. I like the long necklace, but I would like it better if I could shorten it as needed. The headset has to be charged more often than I like, the range is a little less than average, and the reception is not good at all. I must say, though, that the item came in a very pretty box and was situated in the box in such a nice way that the headset could be given as a gift exactly as it arrived.
