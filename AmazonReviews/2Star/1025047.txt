I'm a have a multi-op DJ service and have been using the JBL Eon's since they first came out about 10 years ago .<br />Have had as many as 5 pairs of EONs out running on the different kinds of gigs ranging from school dances to weddings.<br />So when I saw the the EON 615's at $ 500 I bought 2 pair. That turned out to be a mistake for this reason, I need a speaker that has the versatility to play a small wedding & an occasional 150-200 person young crowd. These speakers are very weak at high volumes and everyone says they &#34;sound bad&#34;,even with two JBL PRX 18 &#34; subs. , So , I think JBL would do  themselves a service to drop the EON name on this pair because they are NOT the same quality we came to know & love & had become and industry standard. Just returned from the music store where I had to buy the next level ,JBL PRX 715 and have my fingers crossed they'll pass the test , JBL should stop writing confusing peak spec sheets. We can read. Put the separation of  bass watts and the highs. Peak performance watts are not helpful. You are not fooling us.
