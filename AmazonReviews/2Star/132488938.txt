This drum pad looks tempting for how cheap and light it is, as most pads are somewhat heavy. I'll break down the pros and cons:<br />Pros<br />has a plastic rim so you can do rim shots<br />Its good in making you practice re-bounding the stick (Some-what of a middle ground between bouncy and not-so-bouncy)<br />light<br />VERY durable<br />Anti-slip type of material around the bottom<br />Can be mounted on a stand (the screw hole is present)<br /><br />Cons<br />INCREDIBLY LOUD! I personally don't see a point of a pad if its going to be loud<br />Somewhat small so the rim will get hit accidentally frequently<br />The tension screws like to loosen somewhat frequently<br /><br />So this could've been a nice drum pad but do its loud noise and dis-comfort when playing it, there are definitely better options out there. You can't go wrong with something like realfeel. Vic Firth makes decent stuff too.
