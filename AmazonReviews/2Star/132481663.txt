The product was not working on arrival. the materials looked cheap. There was no power to the transformer. The product looked very cheap. Initially before ordering I had come across another product from LED Wholesalers that was few bucks more but this one had the same picture(except for the manufacturer's name on the packet) and so I thought they are the same products with different labels on it. But I was completely wrong. After I returned this product, I ordered the product form LED Wholesalers [[ASIN:B0040FJ27S B0040FJ27S]] and it was hundred times better than this product. Dont be fooled by this item. Spend the few extra bucks and get the other product. It is well worth it
