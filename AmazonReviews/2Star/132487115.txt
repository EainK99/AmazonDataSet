My dad found a guy selling these mics at a yard sale. He paid $20 for the mic, and it came with a 20' XLR cable. Now, I guess I'm spoiled with my Blue Snowball mic, but this thing is NOISY compared to my Blue. It claims to be a cardioid mic, but this thing picks up noise from all over the place, and not really in a nice directional pattern like my Blue.<br /><br />I'm running this through an Alesis Multimix4 mixer, and I have to have the gain cranked up quite high in order for it to pick up my voice - and unfortunately, it picks up everything else around it. Clicking on a keyboard, shifting in my chair, cables shifting on the desk...It feels more like an omnidirectional mic than a cardioid.<br /><br />Now, maybe this mic would be better to pick up from something like an acoustic guitar or something, but for vocals or a podcasting environment? Stick with a condenser mic. You'll get better sound and performance, and less noise than with this mic.<br /><br />For $20, it'll find duty in my audio setup for environmental noise pickup, MAYBE for a second mic for guests for my podcast, but it's not worth the $80-$90 price tag via Amazon. For less money, you can pick up an MXL 990 with shockmount that's going to give you better sound for vocals than this...<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars because it might be ok for something other than vocal recordings, despite the product info stating it's good for that...
