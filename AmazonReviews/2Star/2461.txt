I have to agree with the other reviews about this accessory pack not being as ideal as I would have expected from Zoom.  I am going to keep it but I did order the Zoom Q8 case as something that can hold all of the pieces including the H2n.  Here is the one I purchased  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XR5D5RA?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00<br /><br />Hope this helps some of you.  Skip this accessory case and buy the Zoom Q8 case and you will have more room to put whatever you need to in it.
