The microphone itself is great. But the place where the threads are supposed to be aren't there. They forgot to cut in the threads so I'll have to tap them myself. Now I'm not going to RMA it because that would take way too long and I need it this weekend. Two stars for quality control failure, missing something like a blank untapped cylinder is pretty dumb.  :T
