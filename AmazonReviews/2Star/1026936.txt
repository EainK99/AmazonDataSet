If you order a Hosa CMS-105 cable, you may actually receive a 3.5mm TRS to 1/4 inch TRS cable instead.  This happened to me twice.  If 3.5 mm were the metric equivalent of 1/8 inch, this would be okay.  More likely the cable I keep receiving is mispackaged or the part number in the inventory system is incorrect.
