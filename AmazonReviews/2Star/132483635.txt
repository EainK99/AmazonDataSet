We've tried a bunch of different bassoon reeds and this is our least favorite so far.  My 7th grade daughter has been playing bassoon for a year now.  First thing she didn't like is that the corners of the reed are clipped off at 45 degree angles (unlike the photo).  Also it seems to be slightly smaller than her other reeds.  Disconcerting since that's not what she's used to or expecting based on the photo and reviews of other hardnesses of this brand.  Secondly, this reed continuously would collapse on her.  Her teacher showed her how to soak and adjust the metal bands to fix this, but then the reed started mildewing due to the soaking.  We keep all her reeds in humidity controlled containers (Rico humidity controls you can find on Amazon), so storage was certainly not an issue.  Too much hassle when you just want a reed that works as expected.
