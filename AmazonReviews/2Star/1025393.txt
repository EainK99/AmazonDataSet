I ordered this with an open mind, because I really didn't need much. I just wanted to replace a cracked neck on a junkie fender. But this neck it's so many flaws it was not worth the trouble.<br />1. It is not possible to cut this for a one piece flange because the overall length of this neck will be too short. I did it anyway because I was desperate, but I had to add nearly 3/8 inch of shimming to make it work. This was a major headache within itself.<br /><br />2. After assembly, I was playing the instrument and I actually cut my middle finger on my fretting hand. The number six fret wire was loose and had slipped down. I was actually able to remove this wire with my bare fingers and had to reglue it into place. The next day the number nine wire had come loose as well. I expect to have to redo all of these.<br /><br />3. The wood is so soft it is impossible to handle without denting. Even though I was very careful, upon final finishing an assembly I have several marks all over this thing even where I  pushed my thumbnail.<br /><br />4. As other reviewer's have mentioned, mine also has slight twisting. When looking down the front board from the nut to the base I can see it is twisted to the right. This is a dealbreaker on a stringed instrument.<br /><br />5. This thing just has the overall cheap look and feel to it that you don't see in the pictures, but becomes apparent once you have it in your hands. Probably because it does not have binding. I realize this is a $63 neck but in my case that was $63 that I should have just flushed down the toilet. Upon final assembly of my banjo I have so many rattles and vibrations coming from various strings in various locations and this item has so many flaws that I have no idea where to even begin to isolate them. This final banjo is nothing more than something I can use to sit on the sofa and keep it muffled and just practice my chord shapes on. It is unusable as a playable instrument
