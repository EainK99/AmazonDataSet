I purchased this from one of the big guitar chains a few years back. I was new to slide and thought it might be fun to go with a slide with a little more personality than a plain glass tube. And personality it does indeed have, unfortunately we didn't get along very well. It works for some applications but due to the concave shape, the bottle rim and the seams down two sides it just felt like more trouble than it was worth. Would I buy it again if I lost mine? No. Do I regret buying it? No.<br /><br />I'm sure an experienced slide player with a proper set up could pull it off, but if that is the case I think we'd be seeing a lot more pro slide players playing with bottle tops. Kudos to BigHeart for giving it a shot but it just didn't do it for me.
