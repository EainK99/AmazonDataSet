I have ordered this item multiple times and always been well pleased.<br />This time the clip on mics arrived with a chord about 3 feet long, instead of the nice 8 foot chord that I had gotten on previous orders.  The mic picks up very well, but, it is almost impossible for me to play hooked to a 3 foot instrument chord that prohibits any movement, and also prohibits playing while standing.<br /><br />I would give the earlier version with the long chords 5 stars!!  Not these.
