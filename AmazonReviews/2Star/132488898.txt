This is a nice looking turntable. Plays ok but you must make sure you set the counterweight properly. The main problem is with the ez vinyl app for Ipad. It recorded and separated the tracks on the first two tracks. When it got to the third track it stopped recording and gave me a error message that I needed more space on my device...at least 1 gb. The problem is that I have over 5 gb of space left. I tried several times to record...even deleted some of my apps to increase space...but continued to get the same error message. They need to update the app. I will keep the turntable and copy my vinyl on my laptop...hopefully they will do the right thing and fix the app...also when you record more than 1 tack at a time you cannot tag the tracks....too bad nice looking turntable...great idea....but should not have put this on the market until they fixed these major bugs.
