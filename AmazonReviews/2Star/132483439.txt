Only a few months old with light use, and the pocket fabric is coming apart. Zippers are still holding on, but the inner mesh is coming loose, also, so picks and whatnot won't stay in place. You get what you pay for here, which is not very much.<br /><br />It's a shame. It's designed well. If it didn't just fall apart, this thing would be about perfect.
