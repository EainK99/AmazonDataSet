Damn !!! It arrived in one day - love Amazon one day prime shipping - but sadly - its doa - had to make exchange arrangements - so the jury is still out for a overall rating - if the second one is also dead - I'll give up & get another brand ... ya'd think Marshell would be a wee bit more finiky on who they would liscence their name to ... had a Joyo amp that crapped out in just over a year - probably used it less then six times ... geez ... not having much luck with electronics lately - my Peavy Viper 3 just died .... Argh ... the gods of music must b p'od with me !!!
