I was so excited for these speakers to arrive, however when I got them they had a european power adapter..yikes and I had to send them back.  So after I get my new ones hopefully I'll be posting a much more positive review. I'm just curious how they sent a European version knowing this was to be sold in the States..... The mystery continues ..
