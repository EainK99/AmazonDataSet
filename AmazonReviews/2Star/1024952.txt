The mic holder is too wide for my mikes. The clip itself is metal, but the mic holder is plastic so I couldn't try to adjust it's size to make it fit mics with a smaller diameter. Holding the clip in my hand, i actually couldn't imagine seeing a lapel mic that would be thick enough to fit in and be held snuggly.
