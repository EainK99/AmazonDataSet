Poor quality fixture. Cooling fans on 2 of the 8 units I purchased went bad within a week and made horrible grating noises whenever powered on. The dimming capability of the Mega QA Par38 is also mediocre. Relatively minor, but visible stepping in brightness as the intensity of each light is increased. Poor quality XLR connectors for DMX signal. The only reason I don't give it one star is that the fixture actually looks really good otherwise. All colors are bright and vibrant, and white looks great with very little color separation. However, the cons outweigh the pros. Spend a little more on a quality fixture. Enough said.
