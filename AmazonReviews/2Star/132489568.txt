As a taller person w/medium build, this is not the ideal bench. At my preferred bench height of approx 23&#34; the legs are a bit short which means there is some likelihood you will tip over if you scoot yourself to the right or left of center. Also, the foam in the seat is rather soft, so after a couple hours i'm actually feeling the hard wood base under the foam. The build quality is fine but the manufacturers choice on the two above-mentioned points are ill-conceived. I will likely be returning this.
