The zippers are inadequate.  This is not a professional level cymbal bag.  The stick bag falls off with more than a few pairs of sticks.  It's cumbersome and uncomfortable to carry.  Seemed like a novel idea...but I think stick bags and cymbal bags should probably be kept separate until some other innovation comes along.<br /><br />I'd suggest Protection Racket or Ahead.
