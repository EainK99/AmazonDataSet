I wanked the Wonk and it's weak. It's like adding a rubberband to my sound. An envelope filter does better. They tried to make the signal path let some bass through while applying the effect- a good idea, but sadly they failed.<br />I compared it to my modern morley wah/volume pedal and it kicked tm stevens clear out of town.<br />I've packaged it back up to keep the diseased graphics from spreading a hideous hype virus, and called hazmat for disposal instructions.
