I bought this item for a house party. The motor of the light produces a very loud whirring sound when the light is in operation. The sound is clearly audible over the music even when the volume is on high. I guess it would work for a bigger room, like a dance hall, arena, etc., when the light would be far away from the dancers, but it definitely does not work for my purpose.
