The swivel knob is *very* difficult to tighten enough, so the iPad doesn't flop around under its own weight. Knob is too small, and there's not enough room to grab it. There are 4 hex screws that hold the table of the clamp together, and two of them fell out. Griffin doesn't have replacements; I'm out of luck.<br />It's difficult to find a bracket that actually mounts on mic stand threads, that can accommodate a case.  Personally, I want the safety of my iPad's case most when I'm on a gig, and my iPad is on a top-heavy stand.
