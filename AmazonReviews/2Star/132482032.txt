I didn't buy the Keylab 49 off Amazon but I'm gonna review it here. First of all, it is a sleek, very well-built controller, but other than that it is absolute crap. Arturia support is no where to be found, they don't reply to emails or forum posts and you WILL be needing them. My computer did not recognize the Keylab at first (which I've read is quite common), and then once it did recognize it, it wouldn't update. Once it finally updated (This is about a week of trial and error after purchasing), it won't work with Ableton. The included AnalogLab software is okay, a majority of the sounds suck but thats just my opinion. The pads feel really nice as well as the faders and knobs but the damn thing is just so frustrating to use, I really wish it would work properly. God forbid you want to map parameters. Anyway, if you want a really high quality and nicely built basic MIDI controller (pretty much only the keys/pitch/mod wheel) for $350, then this is for you. But if you want to use all the knobs, faders, pads, etc. with your DAW of choice, well then good luck to you my friend.
