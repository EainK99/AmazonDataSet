I had a Tascam but couldn't remember the model after it went missing.  Still had the charger unit and thought it would fit this one, but the DR07 takes AA batteries instead of the NiCad rechargable battery.  When I received this unit, I installed new batteries but it wouldn't power up at all.  I arranged to return the unit and received my refund from the seller even before the return was in the mail!  Service was excellent - too bad the product didn't match up!
