The light and remote function properly, but the suction cup that attaches it to the rear window is garbage.  I followed the instructions (which were poorly written and/or poorly translated?) exactly, and the light fell off within 2 days.  While it was still hanging, I noticed an annoying squeaking noise coming from the bag.  That would be the arm of the light that attaches to the suction cup bobbing around while I drove, and it was quite annoying.<br /><br />I'll also mention that on the box it pictures the light illuminated with the word &#34;SORRY!&#34;  - This is the message I was hoping for.  However, the light makes five emoticon faces, and has no messages whatsoever.
