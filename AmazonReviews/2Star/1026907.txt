Does it's job but if the cable is touched anywhere, including both ends, it produces mad feedback. It could possibly be my interface or my mic but I highly doubt that. I use a Nady Starpower Mic & an M-Audio FastTrack guitar/mic recording interface. I'll try another cable and post again. But as of now, I think it's this cable
