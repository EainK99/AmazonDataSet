Detune effect is great for getting that full thick or thin chorus sound you are looking for.<br /><br />The bad part is the pitch shifting and harmonizer are just like you added a vibrato effect to your chain.  Not a straight pitch shift, warbled and unusable. Harmonizer is the same.  Maybe if you can get it for 40 bucks or less, just for the chorus.  Get a micro pog or Pog II for the pitch shifting!
