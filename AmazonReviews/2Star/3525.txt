I got about ten rehearsals out of it and it refused to cooperate any longer. Turns on but no buttons work. Battery compartment awkward, battery unusual. Decent features and was loud enough for the drummer of a loud, amplified band. It just crapped out very quickly and, since it was well cared for, for no apparent reason.
