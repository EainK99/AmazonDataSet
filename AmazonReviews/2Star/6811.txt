These are the most overpriced not so good cables I have ever bought.  I bought four of these and only one cable has lasted over the last three years, and that one is starting to short out.  I thought these were great when I first bought them but they have not lasted as long as my Planet Waves guitar cables.  These are definitely not durable enough for working musicians.
