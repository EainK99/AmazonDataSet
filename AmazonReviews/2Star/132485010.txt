the implication of the ad was that the case was made by kala  for their tenor ukulele. the realty was that the intended fit was for a kala tenor ukulele or any tenor ukulele, thefit is terrible, and I got sucked in by a misleading ad, when you advertise something using a manufacturer.s  name then they should have been the one who made it. Ithe fact that it gothere on time doesn't justify that it's really a piece of shit
