The two stars are for the speedy shipping and good packaging. The unit worked great for about 20 minutes then it stopped operating and wouldn't smoke anymore. The remote switch has to be held down for it to work while it worked. I contacted customer service and they were nice and understanding, they sent me a shipping label to return the product for an exchange for a working unit. I shipped the defective unit back and they gave me a refund instead. I guess they didn't have any working units.
