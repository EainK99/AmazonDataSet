Bought speakers last year march worked great did all my gigs with them with me being a new dj that wasn't very many maybe 10 tops used them last weekend and the woofers burned out on them horns still play woofers GONE!!! what a coincident that they went out 1 yr and 6 months later and the warranty on them are a year what really sucks is i had to cancel my Octoberfest party for next week so yep missing out on money guess it's always a good idea as a Mobile DJ/Small business owner to always have back up in cases like this.... doesn't look very good having to cancel on a client especially at such short notice....
