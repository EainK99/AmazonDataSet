The title seems odd but it is true.  The guitar looks okay cosmetically other than a few glue overspills, but there are many problems that are not cosmetic.  The stand-off is too high, so when you lock a fret like the E string first fret to play an F the amount you have to go down stretches the string producing a very sharp F.  The guitar sports wire strings, but it has a soft neck and no steel rod to support the extra tightness of metal strings so tuning one string sets off the rest.  It will bend quickly.  The strings are not right.  The G string is an overtightened D string.  It will snap.  The only thing that was fine was the case.  I suppose that part is worth the money.  It is vinyl and soft but seems okay.
