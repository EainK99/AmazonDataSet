Bought these to where under my motorcycle helmet. For my situation, its the wind noise or turbulence inside the helmet that requires hearing protection. When i get off the bike and my ears are still ringing, hearing loss has occurred. I bought these so i could leave them at arrival to a store without looking like a dork.<br /><br />They are technically filters and not plugs and did very little to reduce the high frequency wind noise that i was experiencing. They did however muffle the lower freqency tones so much that at highway speeds, i can no longer tell when i need to shift my bike.<br /><br /> They did reduce the wind noise juuuust enough to where the ringing is reduced after riding but it is still uncomfortable and quite distracting.<br /><br />They do fit fairly well and look good so i guess for some one else who needs to filter out a different frequency range than I, they might work quite well. Ill probably keep them for other uses for this reason.
