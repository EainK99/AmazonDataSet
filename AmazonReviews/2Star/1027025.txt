Rigid, no flexibility in the contact point like you would find in other types (like the Sewell Silverbacks).  The wire contact point is also poor.  Once you slip the speaker wire up the center and then try to screw the bottom of this plug back in; it doesn't want to screw all the way back in and has a tough time catching the threads to screw back in.  I just needed one pair for my center speaker, couldn't find the Silverbacks in a single pair, and tried these: wish I hadn't wasted the money.
