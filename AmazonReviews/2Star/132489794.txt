It has nothing ot do with the sound of the distortion or the wah effect...Its the Optical sensor...Its OK for a beginner but as you develop your playing style you notice it has very LITTLE control over your volume. For example: There is a sooth lowering of the volume untill you at aroud 75 percent of the angle on the pedal (so at the range of movement youve used %75) the signal just cuts out...this has to do with the optical sensor...i was told it could be a bad sensor but after replacing it i had the same issue. The distortion is at best Decent for a guitar, but useless for a bass (i used it as a boost) the wah was nothing compared to any mainstream wah (Dunlop) or for that matter even an auto wah (Boss/DigiTech)...<br /><br />In my opinion spend a little more and get a volume pedal, a wah and distortion...<br /><br />Keep makin em Morley...Im sure someone will keep buyin em
