Battery runs out fairly quickly after charging, which is unfortunate because sometimes I use it at a weekend event and dont have access to power for a few days prior to using it and i've had it cut out before the end of my workshop. I use this to teach high energy dance workshops, sometimes at music festivals, and it stays on ok, the main issues I have are battery life and the need to set it a certain distance from speakers - This can get tricky when you are moving around with multiple speakers set up to prevent feedback.
