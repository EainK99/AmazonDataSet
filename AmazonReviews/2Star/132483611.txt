Ordered a set of LP congas and bongos along with the stands.  Bongo mount arrived without mounting bolts to attach to conga stand.  Attempted to contact LP by email and telephone.  No response at all.  Seems like a decent bracket if I would be able to attach it to the conga stand.  Lousy customer service from LP.  Would not purchase again.
