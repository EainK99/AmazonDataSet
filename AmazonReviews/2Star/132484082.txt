This was not what I had expected. I found out that it is more of a production tool than a dj software tool, which is what I was initially looking for. If it is what you are looking for, by all means, go ahead and get this because it looks official. If you are like me and wanted to upgrade to dj software from Traktor going through the NI website is, and will be, the best method to get what you're paying for.
