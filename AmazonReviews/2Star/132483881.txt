The description/title & box says &#34;Rechargeable&#34; and the box says &#34;Batteries Included&#34; but there were no batteries in the box.  I see others had the same issue.  I doubt that it's &#34;Rechargeable&#34; since the box's info on the batteries was incorrect.  I would have to buy the more expensive rechargeable batteries in order to test/prove if it actually recharges.  The AC adapter only has a 2 foot cable on it which is so short that even with my power strip positioned at the base of the music stand, it doesn't reach the light when the stand is in its shortest position.  The light itself is fine but the misrepresentation of the batteries and, potentially, the charger is very disappointing.
