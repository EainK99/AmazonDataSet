Here's the problem. They are nice bags. Sturdy. Attractive. They perfectly fit my StagePas 600i speakers. BUT THAT'S IT. The side pocket is enough to hold your backstage pass. And once the speakers are loaded there isn't room for much else. SO at ninety-nine bucks EACH, that's pretty crazy. So while I like them, two hundred for a pair of speaker BAGS is a bit much. If they were hard-shell it would be a different story.
