The first one we ordered came with a bow that was destroyed and frayed hanging out in the case.<br />The 1st replacement was good, except that the E fine tuner screw slips off of the fine tuner finger. I tuned the E with the peg to E flat, then tried to use fine tuner. That's when the screw slipped off the finger which displaced the finger to the side permanently.<br />The 2nd replacement did the exact same thing. E string are under a lot of tension, the fine tuners on this violin are not robust enough. Everything else is what you would expect for the price, not bad.
