Well, I bought a cheap guitar, and that's what I got. I cannot believe that the regular price for this thing is $150, that is insane! Here are my initial observations:<br />-- This guitar is not the color it is in the pictures provided by the vendor, nor is it sunburst. I noticed this before I bought the guitar, so I wasn't sure what to expect as far as the color goes. It is a dark brown mahogany color . I noticed that the color of the guitar varies with each purchase because some of the customer submitted photos are different as well. I've seen as sunburst (as advertised), a natural color (as advertised in the photos), and also a dark mahogany color; as mine is. So there are at least 3 color/style variations. Don't expect the color it advertises, because it might be different.<br />--It is stated that the guitar comes with a \\"full set\\" of replacement strings, this is false. I got one high E replacement string, not a full set.<br />--I did not receive the pick guard.<br />--It comes with a strap, but it is useless because there is only one strap button on the guitar... as if that does anything.<br />--The frets are terrible (not metal, I think plastic) and they are completely scratched up. When you attempt to bend the strings, they drag across the frets making a terrible scratching noise that interrupts the cord vibrations. This is by far the worst thing about it, in my opinion.<br />--Last but not least, it has some scratches.<br /><br />Any more than 20 bucks, and I would be giving this one star.<br />However, if you are thinking about buying this for a kid (I'd say, 8 and under) it is great - it's probably going to end up trashed anyway, so $20 isn't bad if you have a kid begging for a guitar.
