The finishing of every piece was very rough, the metal pieces were dented and stained, so I had to use a metal polisher on them just to get them to look decent.<br /><br />The plastic surfaces were scratched, and gave the impression that the whole thing was not new.<br /><br />Definetely NOT what I expected, and NOT worthy of the money invested.
