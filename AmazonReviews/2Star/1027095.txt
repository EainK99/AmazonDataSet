The headphones sound is great, but the design or fit can be really rigid and uncomfortable for your head, after a minutes of wearing them a headache is common for me. The sound is great but if you can not stand wearing them, as I do, the headphones are definitely not for you, Maybe check them out if you want to buy, Id recommend the Sony MDRV6 as they are about the same quality and can be more comfortable.
