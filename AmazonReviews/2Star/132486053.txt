I guess this concept could actually work out and Cupid shows a real will to do well with good mechanics, really good strings and a nice backpack case. But thick wood plus tons of varnish make for a rather dead and unequal sound (forget about the normal guitar tuning but even tuned higher it's closer to a 30 toy guitar than to a real instrument). The string height isn't well adjusted and can't be corrected, so it snarls in the lows. My Martin Backpacker is orders of magnitude louder but also much more expressive at a lower price (but of course the neck length is a hinderance when traveling). The Cupid is too narrow neck for men's hands. In the present state it's way too expensive for a toy but i still ended up giving it away to friends' kids. Yet there might be enough potential in the concept to allow a more delicate luthier (hey you can find them even in China) to make it shine.
