This unit could use more bass, but that's my only complaint.  With ocassional usage, the battery in this unit lasts for weeks.  I get a day off a charge when cranked at parties.<br /><br />Update as of May 2016: Unit needs to remain plugged in or it dies.  Not pleased give how often this has been used.
