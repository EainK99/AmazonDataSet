This is not a tablet stand, it's an iPad stand. I wouldn't mind that if it was marketed as such, but it's marketed as an adjustable stand that fits tablets from 8.9\\" to 10.1\\"<br /><br />This doesn't securely fit most other tablets. The reasons are:<br /><br />1. The narrow side is non adjustable. This is the biggest issue. Unless your tablet is the same width as an iPad, there's going to be too much play. (The width there is just shy of 7 1/2 inches.) Without adding a bunch of padding, this would be completely unsuitable to hold a tablet if there's any chance that it might get touched or jostled. I don't believe you'll get a secure fit with, say, the Galaxy Note or ASUS transformer or other similarly sized tablets, despite them fitting the advertised specs for this holder.<br /><br />2. There's fully 5/8\\" of non-adjustable thickness allowance. I know the iPad is thinner than that. With my Surface, there's a good 1/4\\" of play, requiring you to put some rubber behind the tablet to have something even remotely secure. I would think this would be the same regardless of what tablet you're using.<br /><br />See my photos in the gallery. I'm using a Surface RT which has an unusual form factor (and is 10.6 inches, so it's a bit over the max range of the holder, and I won't hold that against it), but you'll run into the same thing with any other tablets smaller than an iPad. I would think that most Android tablets would have a really sloppy fit as well. Fine for sitting lightly on a desk, but not fine for mounting to a mic stand in a performance situation.
