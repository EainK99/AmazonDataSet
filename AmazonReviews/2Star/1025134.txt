After tons of research I decided on this guitar.  Okay, the Martin brand drew me in.  I didn't expect it to sound like my Takamine, but it sounds so tinny.  One of the strings has a buzz to it but the overall sound isn't pleasant at all. Tomorrow I plan to restring it with hopes of improvement. I probably should have spent more $ and bought a better guitar.  I think $100 bucks is all this guitar is worth.  Bottom line, I blame myself.  I should have gone to the guitar store to play all the various traveling guitars.  To be honest, this has scared me off from ever buying another Martin.
