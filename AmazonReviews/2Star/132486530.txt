Poor quality product.  2 of the 11 I purchased failed within a year (so much for the possibility of them lasting 10-20 yrs).  These LED bulbs are longer than the halogen ones they replace, so they didn't fit in the housing correctly (meaning that they couldn't be aimed properly) and were horrific to remove.  A few of them even had some sort of substance melt from the bulb onto the glass covering the housing.  I literally had to pry the bulbs off of the glass w/ a knife and then scrape off the melted substance with a razor.<br /><br />The color is distinctly yellow-green (the color wasn't consistent from bulb to bulb), which I suppose is better than the bright white light cast by other LEDs, but it created for a really sickly-looking room when the lights were turned on.<br /><br />The energy savings compared to halogen is great, but, otherwise, I didn't like these bulbs.<br /><br />I replaced these with the Lighting Ever ones a few wks ago.  The bulbs fit into the housing perfectly, and the light itself is much more neutral (bordering on almost pinkish, at times).  All-in-all, the Lighting Ever ones are a much better product so far.
