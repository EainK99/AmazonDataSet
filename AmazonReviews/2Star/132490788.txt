I agree with all of the positive reviews of this product regarding the quality of sound that these headphones produce. I owned this headset for 3 months and they were my go to set for all of my home and travel listening. Great sound for any entry-level audiophile.<br /><br />My issue is with the cheap and brittle plastic that composes the majority of this set. I was moving the headphones from my head to my neck, applying very little force, when the headband snapped completely in half. I was very careful with this set as I could foresee the plastic headband being an issue, but my best efforts were not enough to prevent a catastrophic failure.<br /><br />There are many headphones in this price-range that sound just as good and are infinitely more durable. Avoid buying these or keep your receipt so you can get a replacement when they fail.
