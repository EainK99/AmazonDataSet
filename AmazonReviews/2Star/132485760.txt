adapter was not the one pictured...it was a generic unit with a slide-on clip (on the wall wart side) that allowed it to be plugged into a standard AC outlet or a foreign-style plug.  Also, the pin that plugs into the unit was too small (the center pin on the VL2 unit is larger in diameter than the hole on the adapter.
