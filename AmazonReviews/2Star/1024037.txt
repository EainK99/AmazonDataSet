At first test, it worked. Better than the on board camera mic from a distance away from your subject, but still below average sound. But don't expect that this can be used out on the field. Working in a fast pace budget environment, I went through 2 of the three mics in the first day shoot. The mic easily pulled away from the cable and exposed the copper wires under the plastic coating. By the 2nd day, the 3rd mic did the same thing. If you use and care for it delicately in a studio environment, then this may suffice .. but that's not likely for most of us.
