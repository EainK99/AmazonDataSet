I bought this to use with my laptop for VOIP (i.e. ooVoo, Skype, etc.), because the microphones built into my laptop stopped working.  Unfortunately even with the recording volume and gain set to 100% and +30.00 dB respectively (which are the highest possible settings) both in the software and driver the person on the other end could barely hear me.  My guess is that this microphone would work a lot better with a dedicated Sony or Olympia sound recorder that will deliver more power to it, but my laptop doesn't cut it.  Now because I was foolish and threw out the packaging assuming that it would work I'm stuck with it, wondering whether to buy a USB sound card that might to a better job powering it or just cutting my losses and buying a USB microphone.<br /><br />P.S. My laptop is a Lenovo Ideapad Y570 with a hardware Realtek HD Audio Codec (I'm not sure specifically which model).  Also I am currently eying the Sound Blaster X-Fi Go! Pro USB Audio System with THX SB1290, because I respect the brand and I can't afford a better one; does anyone know if this will be able to faithfully power this microphone, or if I should just buy a different mic, or is there a better USB sound card that I should get, please comment with your input.
