I spent a lot of time looking for a good sound card for the purpose of recording audio at my home studio.  On the surface, this card looks perfect.  It has all the ins & outs a home studio could ever need.  However, for those of you who need a stable sound card and are thinking of buying this one, you may want to look a bit closer...  First off, this card currently has zero support for windows 8.  Windows 8 OS will not even recognize that this card is plugged in, let alone try and install a suitable driver.  Second, the interface is standard PCI.  Almost no new computer will have a PCI port - they have mostly moved to PCIE.  The sofware that comes with this card is not much more advanced than something that would run on Windows 3.1.  If you are thinking about this card as your solution, I would recommend reading through the forums of customer reviews on this one before you make your decision.<br /><br />Now I will say that M-Audio is working on windows 8 drivers for this card, but cannot give an ETA at this point in time.  My guess is that none of you have time to wait around for them to do so.  I suggest, Asus or a high end Creative Soundblaster.
