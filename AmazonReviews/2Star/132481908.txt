I'm a heavy-hitting drummer and moved to the SPD-SX as my primary instrument. I love being able to load-in drum samples -- rock sounds, hip hop sounds, dubstep sounds, any sounds I want. It's really great.<br /><br />However, I've had 2 units die while on stage. The rubber pad on top came undone on both units (I ended up having to duct tape it down). Then the little LED covers in the rubber get lost under the rubber, causing the whole thing to get lumpy and mis-trigger. I had to carefully shake the loose parts out of the device. Then later, one of the pads stopped responding so I had to re-assign pads mid-gig. Then eventually, the whole unit died while on stage (happened twice, one time on stage in front of 800 people - I had to beat-box the rest of the set (true story)).<br /><br />If you buy this, 1) play it lightly. Don't use mallets or heavy sticks. 2) Get the an extended warranty (usually that's a waste of money, but not with the SPD-SX -- it will end up breaking if you play it like a real drum set most likely).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Good computer software for loading in samples via USB<br />- Easy to program<br />- Responsive pads<br />- Activity lights on pads are a nice touch<br />- Huge 2GB memory -- you'll never run out of space<br />- Real-time effects knobs are awesome, a game-changer (envelope filter!)<br />- The stand (sold separately) is great. I play it standing up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Fragile, will break<br />- Rubber pad comes undone with normal usage & is hard to re-attach<br />- Built-in sounds are not good (you'll want to buy/load in your own samples)<br />- I wish the volume knob were bigger/easier to see like the effects knobs<br /><br />I'm getting a third unit (third time's a charm?) and will try playing it more lightly. If it fails again, I'll take a look at the Yamaha DTX-MULTI 12 (which looks like better hardware, but only 64MB of memory and no real-time effects knobs).<br /><br />I've also had an Alesis SamplePad. It's great and indestructible, and uses external memory (so you can have unlimited samples). It's also a lot less expensive. But the SamplePad doesn't have polyphony -- if you hit 2 pads at the exact same time, only one of them will play. Which makes it pretty much unusable as a primary instrument (it may be okay as just an add-on to your regular drums). I wish Alesis would make a unit with polyphony and more pads.<br /><br />Still, I'm gonna try the SPD-SX again. Really, the only thing keeping me away from the Yamaha, is the Yamaha's lack of real-time effects knobs. I didn't think I'd need those, but turns out they're crucial if you play any kind of dance music (crank the envelope filter, then slowly decrease, then - BAM! turn off the filter for the DROP, crowd goes wild).<br /><br />I hope Roland is reading this and improves this device, which has a ton of potential.destructible, and uses external memory (so you can have unlimited samples).
