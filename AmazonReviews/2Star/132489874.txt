I auditioned many pairs of speakers $100 to $300 class and by far I found this product to be absolutely the worst I have heard for the price. I would suggest to spend ta' bit more and get M-Audio AV40 or higher because you will notice that the sound is thin and tiny coming from these 3\\" woofers. Like many mentioned, I did wait to break them in for more than the recommended time (which does help a bit) but still left me feeling like something big is missing. I gotta give it to the Elevate 3 for the amazing vocal sound but that's about it. I added a subwoofer but it was hard to find the right tonal balance with these. Finally, I decided to spend more and get a real studio monitors that sounds great like KRK.<br /><br />For those looking to buy these to use as computer speaker, you will probably like the overall sound of the mainstream speakers like the Logitech and Creative unless you are primarily interested in the mid and highs or don't like the bass.
