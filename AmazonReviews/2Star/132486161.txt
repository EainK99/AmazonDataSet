When I received the pickguard it had a protectice plastic sheet over the face of the guard. Good, right? Not in this instance. The sheet was rippled and the glue that was used had stuck to the guard causing the glossy appearance to be, well, not so glossy. Furthermore, the screw holes did not line up exactly in all locations. Never-the-less, it was cheap and it was for a MIM Fender. Save your frustration and order genuine Fender parts for your Fender, or better yet, visit quickguards.com and have Mike custom make you some. He's made several for me, including a bob p-bass pickguard, and his work is flawlsess.
