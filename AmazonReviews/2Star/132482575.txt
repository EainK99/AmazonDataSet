I read tons of awesome reviews and a few really bad on this... and actually listened to a friend's set and was really impressed.  I always have had great success and only  a rare failure with Amazon.  THIS is one of those failures that is probably not the fault of Amazon but the supplier to the seller.<br /><br />The low end is nonexistent... the mids and highs are muted and very unbalanced.  When even slightly adjusting the EQ the sould distorts at ALL volume levels.  I called Sony and they told me they have had reports of fake MDR7506 sets coming from Amazon sellers.  Do not fall for a &#34;break-in&#34; periond... SONY says they shoudl be perfect out of the box.<br /><br />I am returning these and will order direct from Sony for slighly more money and tax.  Not worth taking the chance here.<br /><br />I would have given one star but Amazon gets credit for fast delivery.
