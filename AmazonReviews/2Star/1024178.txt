I bought this for the advertised accuracy, for the functions, and for it being, according to some, the best clip-on tuner on the market. But, despite all the ads, this thing has serious issues picking up notes.<br /><br />I've used it on three instruments, a luthier-made classical guitar, a factory-line flamenco guitar and a professional uke. On all three, the StroboClip has had a very hard time reading notes. Apparently, you are supposed to be in tune if the bar stops moving. But, for me, that bar has almost never stopped moving. No matter how gently I turn the keys, the bar never stays in one place. When it shows that I am slightly sharp, I turn the key just a little tiny bit but then I am told I am way flat. So, each time I literally end up guessing where the right note should be. Excuse me, but that's not 0.1% accuracy...And even to guess where the right notes is, this takes me a lot of time, several long minutes. Regarding quality, the body casing appears to be of metal, but the clip is all plastic, and looks and feels cheap. And it's also fragile. The StroboClip is made in China.<br /><br />For me, this tuner has been a disappointment. It takes just too long to use it and it has never given me accurate results.
