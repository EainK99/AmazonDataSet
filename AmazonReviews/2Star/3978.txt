The was great while it worked; I used it successfully with Reason and Logic Pro, until half the keys stopped working... it started out with one dead key, then a couple more, within a couple of months of the first problem half the keys had stopped responding.  I'm a light user, I don't bash the keys hard, unacceptable reliability for a controller of this price.
