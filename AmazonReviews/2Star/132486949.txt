I am a musician. I had read reviews on Amazon about the Hohner Performer 37 key Melodica. People said that it was a professional instrument with excellent and surprising volume. I had also read that just for the case alone it was worth the price. I agree that it comes in a lovely gig bag with a nice adjustable strap. Unfortunately, this instrument simply does not stay in tune. I've not played it very much and have only owned it for about 2 months, but it started going out of tune on the higher end almost immediately. Now after about 5 sessions of less than an hour with it, the top is horrible. The last thing that one would want is its admittedly high volume because it's de-tuning is all the more obvious. Pay a little more and get something that sounds good for more than a week.
