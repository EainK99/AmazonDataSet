The box came opened - the packaging is very cheap - poor quality cardboard. Hardware was loose - and some missing. The cranks work well - in both directions. The unit is heavy - will be a challenge to carry both in my truss bag. The tripods are sturdy. assembling the truss is a challenge - especially slipping the plastic clamps over the pipes. Once the truss is assembled - which is 10 feet, you have to lift it and place it into the clamps. Simply impossible to do with one person. This will have to me modified for any sort of single person use.<br /><br />Once it is assembled and up - I can see it being an asset - allowing the lights to be placed before raising the truss. Note here that even at its lowest - the truss is pretty high.<br /><br />One work around I can imagine is to lay the tripods on the floor. assemble it - and then pick it up. Again, you will need two people because of the weight of the tripods.<br /><br />That said - the tripods impress me as being quality pieces. No T bars - and the upper poles are smaller than my other light tripods.<br /><br />Had I known I would have likely purchased the tripods with the triangle truss that fits on top. More money - but I think much more serviceable for a single person show.<br /><br />If you have an assistant - add a star
