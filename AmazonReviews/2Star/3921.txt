I really liked these headphones, but the ear piece on one of the ears fell off within 2 weeks of use.  I kept them in a felt bag when not in use or charging, and was a little dismayed that I was unable to order replacements<br /><br />Sound quality is good, but beware that the ear pieces may fall off.<br /><br />If the manufacturer replies to my inquiry and is able to send me replacement buds, I will update my review.
