Let me start by saying that I like this mount. It has a lovely, retro style and I would have absolutely loved to use it with my mic. Sadly, in spite of being made by the same company and specifically marketed for use with my mic, it is utterly incompatible due to their threads not matching. According to another negative review, the Radius uses a metric thread, while the Yeti uses an Imperial thread. I can't attest to this myself, but I can absolutely confirm that the two do not work together. All those looking for a shock mount for their Yeti, look elsewhere!
