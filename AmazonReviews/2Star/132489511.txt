It doesn't work on my SG electric because the strap button on the neck of the guitar faces to the rear and you must twist the strap in order to latch it, since you can't reverse the strap latch.  I would suggest a swivel on one end of the strap to solve the problem.  I can't believe this didn't occur to somebody, or maybe I'm missing something here(wouldn't be the first time)
