This thing is made of the cheapest plastic I have ever seen! I would not want to step on it to turn it on or off. I think it would break! Changing the battery is a &#34;real&#34; pain. You must remove the top plastic part to change/install the battery and I thought It was going to break. Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!<br />The repeat rate knob works &#34;BACKWARDS&#34; You turn it in the opposite direction of what you should to get the desired effect you want.<br />It is not suppose to work that way so it is defective. It was not worth paying to send it back. It works, just not correctly!<br />The delay is fair to poor but it was a cheap pedal. I don't turn it on and off. I set it and just leave it on.<br /><br />My advice; If you are going to be &#34;Stomping&#34; this pedal on and Off I suggest you buy a better, more robust pedal.
