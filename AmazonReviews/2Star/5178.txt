The part where the tang, i guess, it's called, snapped when I was playing it very well. Really hard, I guess. It should not have broke, but I was playing, and snap, there it went. It looks nice and everything. Great price for what it its, I guess, but I would almost not recommend anyone who has any experience with one to buy it. For a beginner, though, it is good to learn on. I learned on it. Next one I get, will be a higher quality. That's about it.
