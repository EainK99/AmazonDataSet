I own a number of headphones, and unfortunately these Tascams fall near the bottom in terms of sound quality.<br /><br />These come decently packaged with a carrying case. The cord is tightly coiled and quite long. I sit 10' away from my receiver and have plenty of room to spare.<br /><br />It comes with a mini aux connector (for phones, computers, etc), and a small headphone jack converter for receivers.<br /><br />I have a fairly large head, and these fit comfortably. They're light and don't get too hot, and don't crush my head like some other cans do.<br /><br />However, that's where the pluses end.<br /><br />The sound quality is just not good. Music is muddy, bass heavy and extremely lacking in mids/highs. Unfortunately these days most headphone manufacturers seem to equate strong bass with good quality, which is just not the case. It overwhelms the music, and unless all you listen to is hip-hop, you are missing out on a huge range of other notes.<br /><br />I like Tascam products (I've used some of their recording equipment), but unfortunately these headphones fall flat. Personally, I'd price these at about $25.
