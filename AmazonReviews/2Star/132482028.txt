I gave this one a shot based on good luck with some other Behringer pedals. This Chorus pedal creates (to my ears) a cheap, toy-like effect that didn't do much to the synth signals I ran through it. The buttons on the device offer a few differences in sound, but they don't offer any versatility of dialing in a tone. I'd recommend saving your $30 and applying to something more substantial for a chorus effect.
