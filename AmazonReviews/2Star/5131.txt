The guitar is beautiful. Has an amazing crimson/blood red color to it. But obviously for this price it's very cheap. Each day you have to re-tune it. The nobs that hold the strings in at the bottom are constantly popping out. And today the top string (largest string) snapped in half while I was tuning it. I think it's a good guitar for beginners who just want to play for fun.
