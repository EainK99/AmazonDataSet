The light looksed solid untill I monted. While rotating the blue cap got loose and exposed all leds. I managed to close again. Everytime I turn it on the lights starts to flash between one color and the other and it looks that it's in a kind of demo mode since it alternates between all lights flashing, them smooth...<br />  The remote is great but it does not allways works pointing to the light. Even in a very close distance. I checked the battery voltage and it seems fine.<br />  The colors are amazing but the overall experience for the price was not good.
