its a funny lil thing for $7. The sound quality is no where close enough for musical use, you could use it for some basic communication no problem though, which i guess it was intended for. a little flimsy.<br /><br />also it says 2 pac but I only got 1...? Only really needed the 1 in the first place but still...shady advertising
