It's hard to find an octave harmonica at a decent price.  Tremolo harmonicas are everywhere, but not octave harmonicas.  So I bought this, for just a couple dollars, so see what an octave harmonica sounded like.  The quality of this is not very good, with some notes not playing the upper octave, and it takes a LOT of air to play.  So much so that it is hard to sustain a note for even a full second.  I really don't see this as a playable instrument, and to give this to a beginner would probably just frustrate them.  I did end up buying another octave harmonica by Tombo, and the difference was like night and day... much easier to play.... but also much more expensive.  In hindsight I probably wasted my money on this, but maybe I might take it apart someday and see if I can get it to pay properly.
