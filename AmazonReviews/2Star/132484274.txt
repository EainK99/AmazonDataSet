The package was essentially destroyed as it looked like it was handled by gorillas before it got to my house. The tip of the shofar was actually sticking out of the package when it was delivered. I was not at home at the time... Inside the shofar was wrapped in little bubble wrap...could have been much more...the mouth piece was smaller than I anticipated..have blown shofars for almost 10 years and this one is harder to play than advertised.<br />Finally the shofar is/was cracked and I am in the process of returing the shofar. I believe it was &#34;polished&#34; to much and made the horn material unstable...the lack of adequate packaging probably played a factor in this as well
