I bought this plasticized reed because I found that I often had a wee nick in the cane-style reed prematurely. Perhaps I did, but this plasticized jobbie didn't work for me - the sound wasn't the same, and it took more air from my old lungs to blow through the contraption!<br />Stick with reg reeds, I say.....but remember - this is just \\"one man's opinion\\".
