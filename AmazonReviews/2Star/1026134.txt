Has much less airflow than expected. It’s also very noisy at the top speed. At low speed the fans make a noise that is irritating. It looks nice but is heavy and the metal case vibrates which adds to the fan noise. The display is simple but the smart mode doesn’t seem to work right. Seems like the temperature reading is not accurate and fluctuates a lot. Looks nice but not high quality.
