Needed 2 other adapters to get it to work BOTH speakers of a simple set of PC speakers. That jack is 1/4&#34;. Because there is no ruler in the picture, I thought it would be 3.5mm. I got the adapters, test good ahead of event. Product lit says AAA in receiver, but needs a supplied AA, as does the mic. The lid on recvr had to be taped closed, kept on popping off.<br />  We bought this for my Dad's Memorial who had died 2 weeks earlier, and we expected many elderly persons to attend, most of which would have a degree of hearing impairment. FAIL. Did not work during the event. Autopsy (of mic) concluded that the provided batteries only had enough electrons to pass a short test.<br />  Except for the receiver batt compartment, the design and quality seemed good. The AA batts were not alkaline. I spent almost 4 hours testing and acquiring mono to stereo adapter, 1/4 to 1/8 adapter, only for it to pass the test and FAIL.<br />  I suppose if you are a PA professional, should have known about the battery problem. But my Pop dying was a once in a lifetime event.
