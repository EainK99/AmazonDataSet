When this voice amplifier arrived I was not impressed by the cheap packaging and everything looked plastic and very flimsy.  However, I took it out and tried it and knew I was not going to keep it.  It made a horrible screeching sound and for a teacher would be more trouble to use than not.  The voice amplifier did work but every time I moved the high pitch sound would emit.  I move around the room and talk constantly.  Disappointing.  I think Amazon should stop selling it as I only bought it from them because I generally trust their products.
