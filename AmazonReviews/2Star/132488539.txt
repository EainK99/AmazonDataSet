My kids honestly loved this keyboard... it was descent for the price for starters and beginners. Had a lot of cool sounds, demos and features, good size but not the best feel. Didnt come with much literature or learning material but these days you can find e-books and youtube self-help vlogs that will get you through until you get serious enough to take professional lessons. Unfortunately two weeks shy of a one-year anniversary, the keys stopped playing so there goes $50 bucks...
