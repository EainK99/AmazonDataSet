Worked, technically, for some months before very gentle use somehow caused the cable to sever somewhere inside the insulation. The cable was rarely even moved and never manipulated into harsh angles. Even on first use, the connection was loose. Whether or not it was a defective unit, it was certainly cheaply made.
