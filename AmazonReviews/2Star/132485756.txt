Gave this one to myself for my recent birthday. Always wanted to have a real Fender. Unfortunately even though this is a mid level Mexican made Strat I am having to return it. This guitar would just not stay in tune. Changed the strings, adjusted the truss rod, etc. Did an entire set up in other words. The guitar would not stay in tune. Even after only 20 minutes on or more strings were off. Then I noticed that the bridge was slanted up way to high. So obviously something there is amiss and I really did not want to have to start fixing a new instrument. On the plus side its a good looking guitar and those humbuckers are pretty good too. But it's going back.
