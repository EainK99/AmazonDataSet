I was highly bothered by the fact that I had to fiddle with all my cords and the plugs going into the Behringer to get the darn thing to function properly. If you dont have the plug into the input about a 1/4 of a inch pulled out, you'll only have sound on one side of the headphones.<br /><br />Why this is the go-to for podcasters, I don't know, must be because the Behringer Mixing boards are worth the money, but this amp, isn't.
