Maybe it is just me because I consider myself a beginner although I played the violin while in High school (over 40 years ago) I have settled for playing clasical guitar since then and own many guitars. I have been wanting to play the violin again and thought this could be a cheap entry level instrument to learn. The result was as follows: The battery was dead, one of the strings popped while I was trying to tune it, I could not get the chin rest to stay in place, the strings do not stay in tune, and I find it impossible to play the A string without touching either the D or the E string (the bridge may need sanding, but where and how much?). Since I don't know how to set it up properly and the price of the instrument does not warrant new strings, new pegs, three more fine tuning screws, new rosin and a new bow I am having serious thoughts to returning it before the 30 days expire. Any help?
