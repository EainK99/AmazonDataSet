I'm a professional musician and was so excited when I heard my brother wanted to play trumpet that I bought him this product to get him started. The trumpet itself is in great playing condition, and looks beautiful. The problem is: the box it came in was damaged quite extensively and the instrument case has a large, deep tear in it. I've never had to give someone such a low rating but I'm very upset that I received a damaged product.
