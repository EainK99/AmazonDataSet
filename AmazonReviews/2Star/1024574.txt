Although this is a decent amount of sticks for the price, you're not getting anything better than a discount brick of unbranded sticks from your local music chain.<br /><br />They arrived today, and immediately I noticed how much fatter they are than my normal 5Bs, by almost 2mm.  There's no way I'll try my younger students with them.<br /><br />I also noticed the finish is very random, some much smoother than others. Usually I rub my sticks with paraffin for enhanced grip so it's not a huge deal for me.<br /><br />Finally, I had to manually go through the pairs to find matching sets on my own, because they are not properly matched with the sections of wood used and won't evenly balance out.  You'll notice from the wood grain pattern.<br /><br />They are not consistently weighted, either. I will need to use my jewelry scale to make (closest to) perfect pairs.<br /><br />Combined with the very cheezy logo and cheap screen printing (leaks and smudges everywhere, sometimes not even near the logo), and you're left with a product that if I saw in a store, I would definitely not even bother with.<br /><br />I really recommend going to the store to buy sticks. I've been burned VERY OFTEN, no matter what brand.<br /><br />I've gone to stores and they've tried to sell me Vic Firths and Zildjians that were NOT matched, even by length (which shows you that no matter how reliable the brand, defects pass through, or sometimes people in the store just mix things up), so try them before you buy, ALWAYS.
