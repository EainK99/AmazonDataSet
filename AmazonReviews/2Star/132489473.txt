I have had the Spider IV 120 amp for a year and a half now and for a while it was great. I bought the pedal that goes with it and linked it with online capabilities so that I could download even more tones online. THIS AMP HAS GREAT...GREAT TONES!! After a year and a half, I have three problems with this amp:<br /><br />1) Totally not worth $400. It is very difficult to play live with this amp with out the pedal (an additional $150 - $200 purchase). The tones are outstanding but not worth $400.<br /><br />2) The amp malfunctions...by this I mean that once out of every ten times I turn the amp on and begin to play it, it plays REALLY LOUD for like 2 seconds then goes back to normal volume. As a player, this makes me look very bad. The LED light that tells me what settings I am using does not work anymore. AND about a couple of months ago I had to put it into the shop because it would not play loud at all! This amp is very frustrating!<br /><br />3) There is no direct out switch. In other words, I can not plug into a house system during a performance. The only way the audience can hear me play (with my Line 6 settings) is to mic my amp (which creates poor quality sound) or to turn up my amp at a very high volume (which makes the musicians around hate me and constantly tells me to turn down).<br /><br />Overall I would suggest NOT buying this amp. I am currently trying to figure out if and where I can trade it and the pedal in so I can get some store credit or something to buy a different amp (whose name is not Line 6). But for now I will deal with this amp. Again this amp is overpriced, malfunctions, and has no direct out. I do not suggest buying this amp.<br /><br />EDIT (2/2/14): Do NOT buy this amp! Go buy the Line 6 pod hd500x pedal instead! Look it up, TRUST ME!!
