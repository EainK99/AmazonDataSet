I gave these strings a try but they did not seems to bring the &#34;punch&#34; I was seeking - which I do get from other strings. But the biggest problem I had with these specific strings was that although I tried them for almost three weeks, they wouldn't not stay consistently tuned. They do sound good, and truth be told I play mostly Salsa/Latin Jazz - but the RS88LD didn't provide the sound/feel I want. The big deal-breaker for me was that I have not experienced such a long time for strings to settled in as these did. Perhaps I got a bad set...
