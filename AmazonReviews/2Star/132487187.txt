My husband bought these for me several years ago. They fit me well and are adjustable and comfortable. When my kids kept breaking ear buds or sony brand over the ear headphones, I decided to spend about the same amount of money or slightly more and get these headphones for my kids (girls aged 8 and 14) as well. So far, so good! Not only does the performance beat a lot of the more popular brands out there, they don't really break easily. As an added bonus, you can also purchase replacement parts directly from Sennheiser, such as the earphone holder or replacement ear cushions as these things can wear out long before the mechanical parts do. My husband has a more expensive pair (  Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones  ) that he has had for over 10 years that still work, and he uses them all the time, at home and at work. I wouldn't buy any other brand.<br /><br />Edited 3-11-2014<br /><br />I am going to have to modify my review of these headphones. I bought 2 pairs of these, just over a year ago, for my daughters. Both of them have the same problem. They can only hear sound out of one side. My older one uses hers a lot, and my younger one uses hers occasionally. I am very disappointed, as I have always had the best of luck with Sennheiser. I would buy the brand again, but certainly not this model.
