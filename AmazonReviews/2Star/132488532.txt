I had high hopes for this little mic. In the end there were a few things that ultimately sent this mic packing back to Amazon. The cord is a little short for any practical application outside of sitting in from of a computer. I suppose you could add an extension, but it could use a longer cord. The sound quality is not that great from this microphone. Simply put, the sound is muffled and low quality. My webcam provided better sound compared to this item. I don't think it is a true lavalier microphone as it seems to capture sound from a broader area than a traditional lavalier microphone might. On the plus side, this item feels well built.
