The only reason I am giving this product two stars is because I liked the design. I liked the color and and the way it looked. What I didn't like was the sound quality and the way it fit my head. I read other reviews, even the bad ones, and wanted to try it anyway because I thought they were cool headphones. I had a pair of monster N-Tunes and they broke within three months of use. The plastic headband snapped in two places. These don't have a plastic headband, which I liked, so I thought they would be a good idea. However to my disappointment, the size was too big and the sound quality wasn't that great. I could hear EVERYTHING around me and anyone else around me could hear my music, even if it wasn't that loud. I was very disappointed by these headphones and would never recommend them to anyone. As soon as I got them and used them for one song, I knew I was sending them back for a refund.
