After my MXL 990 broke, I entered the market for a new condenser microphone. This mic looked pretty neat and had good reviews so I gave it a shot. Once it came in the mail, I set it up, recorded my first voice over track, and listened to it back. I was immediately disappointed. I couldn't stand how tinny this microphone sounded compared to my old MXL 990. The sound was not at all robust and didn't pick up lower frequencies very well. Honestly, this mic didn't sound much better than the gaming headset I had been using. I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. I returned it and bought myself another MXL 990, which, for only $40 more, sounded ten times better.<br /><br />In conclusion: If you're just starting out and want a cheap condenser mic, you'll probably be okay with this one. But if you're in need of higher quality sound and are willing to spend a bit more money, you can get much better microphones than this for under $100. The difference is huge in my opinion.
