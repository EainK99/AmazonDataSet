After I purchased this interface, I came accross an article stating that this model has a high pitch in the inputs.<br />Ok, mine arrived a few days later..I had to go out of town for 2wks, got home, connected the interface and was happy upon running my DAW with no noise issues. Unfortunately I'd forgotten the article stated inputs and I'd yet to lay vocals..About 15 days later I'd created some new tracks and decided to hook up my B1 mic.NO!!!<br />Phantom power began to resonate a high pitch whistle. I switched inputs to no avail.<br />Just as the article stated . And 30 days had gone by for returns.<br />I kept this interface with all its phantom bells and whistles ..<br />I decided to purchase a mic preamp for extra gain and phantom power.<br />I got the behringer mic800.<br />Now the whistling phantom is gone as I'm now using the preamp phantom running thru the tascam us200 (phantom turned off).<br />If you purchase this interface and you have a good ear, you will hear the whistling phantom.
