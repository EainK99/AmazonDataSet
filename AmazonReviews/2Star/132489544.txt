I have played guitar and banjo for 50 yrs and feel that this is strictly for beginners playing melody on the high strings with a noter. The action is too high and if you fret the other strings go sharp. One reviewer suggested taking it to a repair shop where they could adjust it but I wouldn't want to spend any more on it. My advice would be to spend a little more and get something playable to start with.
