I've had trouble with this since I got it. The actual pop filter works well, and does what you want it to do. What I have trouble with this the goose neck holder. I've attached the clamp to the farthest point on my mic boom arm that I can get to the end, but even then, the goose neck is just barely long enough to extend in front of my mic. It takes some wrangling to get it to stretch and stay put in front of the mic, and even then the screen is nearly on top of the mic screen if not in contact with it. I'm using a Rode Procaster on a shock mount.<br /><br />This would probably work well if you're using a condenser microphone or a snowball, where the diaphragm is perpendicular to the boom arm. I would look elsewhere if you're using a microphone where the diaphragm is parallel to the boom arm.
