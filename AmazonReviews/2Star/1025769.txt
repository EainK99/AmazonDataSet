I wasn't crazy about this at all.  The height of this nut seems a LOT lower than the original nut that came with my Epiphone Les Paul causing a lot of buzzing.  I didn't feel like changing the setup of my neck so I just returned this nut and went back to the original nut.  I just felt like trying it to see if it made any difference in the sustain.
