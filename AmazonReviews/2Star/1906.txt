Note- Does not Fit Epiphone SG Special! Mine is circa 2002 model and it will not fill the space between the humbuckers completely. Everything else is Great and good craftmanship otherwise. I had to add my own custom made filler plate to complete the build. I have not been able to find this style pick guard that will fit my guitar with proper spacing between humbuckers without a &#34;custom&#34; price and having to send your guitar out.<br />Good price, but be prepared to do some custom work yourself!
