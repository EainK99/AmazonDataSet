Bought this cajon and LOVED IT!!! The sound is beefy, and the snares are on point. It is probably one of the best sounding drum/cajon I've ever played. I used it at all my local open jams, camping, and I record with it too, and everyone loves it! Only reason I give it 2 stars is that after having it for about 3 weeks, it cracked at the top in the middle. I returned it, and Amazon was quick with a replacement. The second one cracked in the same spot. I returned the second one with no issues on the return, Amazon was great with the second return. Unfortunately the third one also cracked in the same exact spot. I even used a mic so I didn't have to hit it hard to keep up with the acoustic jam, but unfortunately it cracked again. I have officially returned the item for a full refund, and will be switching the brand make and model.. Very sad because this drum sounds amazing!!! Pictures attached as to where these keep breaking..
