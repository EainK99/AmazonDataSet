I really didn't buy this guitar for playing but for the artwork.  I plan to hang it on the wall of my guitar room.  Try as I might, I could never get a decent sound out of it using several amplifiers including a Peavey (which I really like).  Maybe it is just me not being able to get a good sound from it.
