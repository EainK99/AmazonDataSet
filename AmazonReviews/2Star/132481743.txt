I bought this unit about 6 months ago and I only used about 4 times with the kids. The green laser went out and the unit only carries 90 day warranty. A 5 cents worth of advice, which I learned the hard way: read the low star comments and make your judgment. All the low start comments had the same issue one of the lasers went out. I can still use the unit but was not worth 100 that I pay for in my opinion with little use I gave it. Save your money and purchase a more expensive unit and you won't regret it.
