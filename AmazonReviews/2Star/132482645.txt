I've spent hours and thousands of dollars trying to figure out the right solution in digital effects.<br /><br />I found this to be of good quality, no issues.  Relatively easy to use once you understand the sequence/principal behind how it is setup, etc.<br /><br />The downside....<br />The distortions were too &#34;glassy&#34; sounding for my tastes.  Even the tech support person at Line 6 stated they didn't like the distortion sound.  It was nearly impossible for me to find the correct distortions to match the 40 coverband songs we play.  note, I play through a clean channel 30watt tube amp.<br /><br />We gig out, for outdoor event...  and you cannot always see the indicator lights when you're in the sun.  Which means, you are hosed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you cant tell which effect is on or off, it is very easy to turn on the wrong ones, or get the wrong combinations, and things get weird FAST.<br /><br />I found the electronics IMPOSSIBLE to navigate in a live gig setting.  In a studio, when you can write down a chart of where all of your patches are stored, and what they all do, that is one thing, but when you are jumping around in a gig, and may change the sequencing, these digital effects are NOT EQUIPPED to handle a performance cover band environment, especially outdoors.<br /><br />This is not just specific to Line 6, but many of the other digi-effects on the market.<br /><br />Good luck.  I went from Line 6, to all pedals, then I finally found UTOPIA !!!!!!<br /><br />It's called Mainstage, by Apple.  Look it up.  If you are a performing musician that plays many different tunes, and have different tones for those different tunes, and need to be able to easily switch from one song to another and not lose track of things, go check out MainStage.
