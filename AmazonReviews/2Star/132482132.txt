Got these because I had read some reviews of people saying they fit the Yeti Blue mic.  This is sadly not the case.  Even with stretching, I could not get them to fit over the mic dome and one of the windscreens I tried to fit ripped and became unusable.  Oh well, was so cheap it's really a non-issue for me.<br /><br />I'm sure they are great for smaller or more standard mics, but Yeti Blue users be warned.
