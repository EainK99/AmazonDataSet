The product description (Reliable Hardware Company RH-6-SRR-A 6U, Full Hole 6 Space Rack Rail Pair)  shows 6 pieces but only two (1 actual pair of angle brackets) are shipped with the order.  The appearance of the photo suggests that the other pieces in the photograph would be for assembly of the base brackets, but this is not the case.  Why would one order just two individual brackets?  I assume this is true for the other bracket sizes also.  Buyer beware.
