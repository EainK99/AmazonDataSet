I purchased this through Sweetwater Sound a few years ago. I also purchased an ILOK in order to use it. I used this program along with a Yamaha CP300 stage piano and a Steinberg U22. Well, after using this for a few months, I found that it didn't sound as good as the original CP300 piano (at least not to me). Of course, the comparison of this product along with internal piano sounds and other products is highly subjective. However, I just was not able to determine that this product's piano sounds were better and I was somewhat disappointed. I gave it two stars for effort but that's about it.
