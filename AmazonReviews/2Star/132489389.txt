However.... the durability of this product is very weak!!!<br />sad to report that not even a dozen gigs in less then a year and the outputs have diminished....repair will take, according to several &#34;official repair sites&#34; 6 - 18 weeks. thats it! going back to the &#34;lesser&#34; YAMAHA!!! IT NEVER FAILED ME!!!
