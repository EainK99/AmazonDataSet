The sound quality is ok, but it's made out of hard, cheap plastic. They look really flimsy and aren't very comfortable to wear for a long period of time. The only real plus is I have a large head and they fit fine. I have found that I don't really like wearing these at all and have gone back to my ear buds and I plan to buy a better pair of over the ear ones in the future.<br /><br />I do regret buying these.
