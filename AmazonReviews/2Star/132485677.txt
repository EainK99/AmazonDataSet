I am calling customer service right now. On hold-these bells I have ordered in the past and love them. I teach an early childhood music program. Ordered 36 more to match my other bells and they sent me a whole different kind of velcro bells that are NOT the ones in the picture. They have a much lower sound and are not as well constructed in my opinion. They are pink, purple, orage, lime, and red in color. They are wider and a much smaller velcro adjustment. I only got a voicemail and left a message hoping they will rectify the problem. Will keep you posted!If the problem isn't rectified I will not purchase from them again.
