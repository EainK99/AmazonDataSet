Cool looking strap but let's be clear that it is not &#34;locking&#34;.  It dropped my semi hollow body guitar, luckily only cosmetic damage done.  The silicone ends seem to fit snugly around any strap button but don't be deceived into thinking that they're &#34;locked&#34; on to the button.  They come off more easily than they go on.  Be especially careful with any guitar that has a button on the back.  Not having the button axis parallel with the neck redirects the pressure on the strap end and button, increasing the possibility for a drop.
