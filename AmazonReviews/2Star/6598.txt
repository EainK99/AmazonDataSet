Decent enough that it's functional and have used to at home and for live shows. Too much moving around though and you can hear it begin to crack a little bit. I thought the coils/stretch would provide greater ability to move around without putting too much tension on my cables/inputs and I'm not convinced that it does with the audible sounds that come with movement along the cable.
