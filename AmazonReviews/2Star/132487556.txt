It's a beautiful bamboo flute, and if your purpose it to place it as a decoration, by all means, buy it. However, if you want to play it, my advice would be to go to a reliable store and try it out; because even for an experienced flute player like me, I had a hard time getting the sound out. Of course, after multiple tries, I was able to make a clear high-pitched sound. Though, to my dismay, the lack of a fingering guide does not help my predicament at all, so I find myself with a bamboo flute that I have no clue how to play. As a result, my advice is, unless you have full confidence that you will be able to play this flute or you want a cultural decoration, my advice would be to go elsewhere.
