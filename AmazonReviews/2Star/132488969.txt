It looks beautiful and sounded great at first. Some frets sounded dull, off key. Saddle was high on one side and very uneven. G string too high. Grooves in nut not deep and wide enough. Tuning pegs too close together so strings were touching lower pegs. Most frets sounded great. Would have been a great instrument, sad to see it go. Good price, bag was fine. Good service from Amazon.
