This clip is actually pretty strong, BUT it´s to long for my taste, i thought i could hide it somehow to make it look as if my leather strap was actually atached to the guitar neck but it´s too long for that. The good point is that it is solid, it holds very strong, you can pull from it and it dosen´t clip off.
