I received the cheap violin recently. I was not expecting much because of the price & this cheap violin actually sounds sort of okay. I am extremely disappointed with how this instrument was advertised as having ebony fingerboard, tail piece, chin rest & tuning pegs. Those so called ebony parts are in fact, not ebony at all. Those parts are some sort of inferior wood that has been stained or dyed black! As I said, I was not expecting much for the price. What pisses me off the most is the false advertisement. It has always been my understanding that if you falsely advertise a product, that is illegal, and you are setting yourself up for a lawsuit!
