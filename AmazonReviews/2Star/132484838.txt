Sturdy shelf?  YES.<br />Difficult to install?  YES.<br />Impossible?  NO, but it may depend on your Gator rack case.<br /><br />If you haven't read other reviews, be forewarned that this shelf is poorly measured.  I actually measured the depth of both sides (between the front & back rack ears) and they were a full inch of a difference.  That's just crazy.<br />But I'll tell you the trick to get it into your case that should save you lots of agony and time.<br />On each side of the drawer are two bolts that can be easily loosened.  Unfortunately I didn't own a tool that would fit them, so I just used needle-nosed pliers.  Once you loosen them, you can expand or contract the length of each side.  Sadly since I have no thin bolt-tightening tool (flat wrench?) it's near impossible to tighten those bolts once they are inside the rack case, other than slightly with my fingers, but the ears attached to the rack grills give plenty of support.<br />But even in doing so, the un-adjustable WIDTH of this shelf is a tad too wide, causing such a TIGHT fit, I had to shimmy it downward into my rack case, expanding the side grills as much as possible.  In doing so, there is extreme tension on the sides, which makes the drawer extremely tight and almost not usable to pull open & closed.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not yet, but if I am ok with having it FIXED open, then I'll be ok.  Other retractable shelves are either more expensive, or considerably cheaper in build quality.  I CAN shove it back in but with serious force and needing to hold the entire rack.  Very bad design.
