Not sure what or how this could have happened. I ordered 3 of these and they ALL had connection problems with my guitar input jacks. Each one popped and clicked when I wiggled the cord close to the jack. When I took the end off the cable seemed to be well put together and it feels like a quality cable but nonetheless they did not work well for me.
