Ok, I have 4 of these in my tour bus. We have used them for about 4 Years now and they have been working fine up until now.<br /><br />&#60;&#60;&#60;Warning&#62;&#62;&#62;  After a while the speakers start going into &#34;Noise Gate/Peak Limiter&#34; clip very easily its gotten worse as time goes on.  We started noticing it at higher volumes or when someone gets on the Mic. Now it is happening at lower volumes like 1/4 turned up. Its not the actual front light that goes in to clip its the Limiter Knob on the Rear.<br /><br />What we do to get the speaker working again:  With Power button on, Turn Limiter knob all the way up and pull the power connection out of the speaker until the light goes out. Then turn down knob all the way to zero, turn off power button, plug in the speaker, turn power back on. The Speaker should turn back on again.<br /><br />These have been great up until lately so unfortunate that they have this stupid defect as I've always liked how they sound and work but this problem deems them useless except for low background music. Upsetting to say the least. Shame on you Behringer.
