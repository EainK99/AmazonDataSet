Sounds okay, but I had numerous problems with this microphone.<br /><br />First, sections were just loose to begin with. Fortunately, I found I could tighten the bottom section and that improved.<br /><br />Next, both controls (the On/Off switch and the Volume control) fell off within in the first few minutes of working with them. To clarify, the caps or knobs fell off. The switch itself was still intact. But the caps and knobs are tiny rubber like pieces and could've easily been lost. It felt very cheap.<br /><br />Next, while it sounded good at first, I suddenly started getting some loud 60Hz hum. This was isolated to where the USB cord connected to the bottom of the mic. Reconnecting everything firmly reduced the hum but I don't know for how long.<br /><br />While the capsule seemed pretty solid and sounded okay, the rest of the mic felt cheap and poorly designed. I may take a day to play with it but the mic is very likely going back.
