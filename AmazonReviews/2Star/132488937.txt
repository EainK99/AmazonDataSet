The metal was bent when I received it. I had to bend it back to fit it in my 19&#34; rack. The body is extremely light and thin gauge metal. This is not a surge protector. All it has is a 15A glass fuse.<br /><br />Pros: The sockets are oriented vertically. So a slightly large plug/adapter is less likely to interfere with the adjacent sockets.<br />Cons: The distance between the vertical sockets are just a little too less. A large adapter can render 2 adjacent sockets useless.
