This shoulder rest is okay.  I have used it for the past week or so and find that it is comfortable. BUT, it loosens up during playing and makes the actual shoulder part wobbly.  I also had trouble straightening the feet out after folding them and had to have my husband use a screwdriver to pry the feet to the downward position.  Needless to say, I won't be folding the feet for storage.  Anyway, you get what you pay for.  Again, it's okay, but I wouldn't buy this one again.
