I bought these from eBay, can't review them there so I am doing it here.<br />Honestly, I wanna say that these are good speakers, but they aren't.<br />I have M-Audio AV40's (WAYYYY better sound for studio work)<br />These have no vocal presence at all, the bass is decent but not accurate<br />even with the treble knob all the way up the vocals sound really thin.<br /><br />I will use them as a reference after the mix is done on the AV40's<br />just to see if it sounds good on crappy speakers.<br /><br />If you need studio monitors or just want good speakers, the M-Audio AV40's are a lot better.<br /><br />[...]
