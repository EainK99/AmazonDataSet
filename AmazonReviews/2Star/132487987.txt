It will hold my mandolin up, but just barely. Lots of wobble - a moderate bump would send it toppling over backwards. It's a bit too small and wobbly to really feel stable with a mandolin. On the carpeting in my apartment, it's even less stable. A uke would be fine though. I do like that it folds up compactly for taking to a gig.<br /><br />Also, I knew it wasn't the most attractive stand when I ordered it, but now that I have it it just looks and feels cheaply made. I think I will bite the bullet and get a larger metal stand for my home studio. I now realize that all these small folding stands that support the mandolin only on the bottom are probably not going to be very stable -- you really need a stand that supports the neck of the instrument.
