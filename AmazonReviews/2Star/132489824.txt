Ordered two of these for connecting 1/4\\" instrument cable to XLR. One of these worked perfectly for about 2 hours, then I started to get noise from a bad connection on the XLR end. The second box I ordered had a bad connection at the XLR end right from the start. At this price this item might be worth the gamble if you are going to set it up once and then never disconnect or move anything, but if you need a reliable, semi-durable DI box I would not recommend this product.
