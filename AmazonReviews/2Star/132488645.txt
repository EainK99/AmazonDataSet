My daughter plays the oboe so I thought this would be a perfect gift for her.  It was nice when it came but after about 6 months the color seemed to come off and now it looks goldish/yellow in spots and does not match the rest of the necklace.  She loves it and will still wear it but be aware it doesn't  hold up with the original color<br /><br />Addendum<br /><br />Well the oboe is now all orange in color and broke in half.  My daughter is very disappointed .  I do not recommend this product.
