Nope, I've played  a lot of different strings in my 20+ years of playing guitar, I've never hated a set of strings as much as these. I'm not a very technical player, so I really can't critique these in great detail. The entire time I had these on my guitar though it just never felt right. I prefer my gauges to be on the heavier side, which I got the mid level ones. Way too much give in the strings for how thick they were, they almost felt like the rolled like a nylon string almost when I did bends/pull offs....Should have stuck with D'addario's.. I would have gave one star but the set of strings came with a sticker for that's kind of neat.
