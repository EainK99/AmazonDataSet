i used the duplicator for about two months and the machine just stopped working.Got in contact wirh the company and they want to send me a replacement part  but i woyld like a new machine .There's no tellin what else is about to stop working and they want me to replace the part myself.So if by chance i dont know what i'm doing there may be another problem.
