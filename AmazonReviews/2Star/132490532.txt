Wanted to get rid off some noise generated from other pedals and it seems to work fine, however the trigger dial only has noticeable effect from 12 o'clock onwards.    Update: after a bit more than a year of less than sporadic use, the pedal just shorted out on me while swapping a few pedals on my pedalboard. It was probably my mistake to not cut off power before doing the swaps, but all my other pedals seem to be able to take this kind of abuse without any problems. Deduct two stars for wimpyness. This pedal will not be missed - I´ll stay away from the brand going forward. On the bright side, the two patch cables still work!
