Do your homework and you'll find some negatives across the web about this unit. Just a few are:<br /><br />Problems with the registration process<br />Popping and crackling<br />Buyers unhappy with the included software for various reasons<br />No volume control on 3/4<br />Not enough phantom power to power two mic's<br />Audio can stutter<br />Headphone volume is low<br />Driver issues<br />Only USB powered instead of a separate power supply to insure enough power<br /><br />I did not find the email support helpful. I sent a detailed explanation of what I wanted to do and included a screen shot and the answer was \\"what do you want to do?\\"<br /><br />If you want to record more than 2 inputs at a time you must know how to use the ASIO drivers.<br /><br />My experience has been mixed. I'm not likely to buy another Native Instruments product. Look at the Focusrite Scarlett units instead, especially those that can be used as stand alone mixers.
