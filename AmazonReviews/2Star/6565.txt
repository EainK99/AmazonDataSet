I bought this light because it was wider than other &#34;reading&#34; and &#34;music stand&#34; lights.  In that regard, I was very happy with the width and adjustability of the light bar.  I was also very pleased that the back glare guard was generously sufficient to protect the eyes of the audience.  I liked that it had a carrying bag, but getting it into the bag was always a hassle.  The bag should be longer and skinnier so that one doesn't have to twist the neck like a pretzel and fight with it to get it in just so.<br /><br />I have used this light four or five times now in three different settings.  I guess that if you are in the orchestra in a dark room, this light might seem &#34;mighty bright&#34;.  However, if you are a teacher that just needs more light for the music stand your students use, it doesn't come close.  I would like a white light instead of the dim color it is, and the brightest setting should actually be the low setting.  In addition, the clamp was a real bother to use.  It is too wide for the thin top of my lovely Manhasset music stand, and too short to grip the wider indent very well.  So, it always seems like a precarious balance.  I will be returning this, but I sure don't know what I will buy that can replace it!  In many ways, it is better than anything else I have seen!  I guess I will go back to my downturned floor lamp.
