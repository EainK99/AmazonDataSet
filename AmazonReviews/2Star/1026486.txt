It is hard to get the earphones to stay in your ears and there are no instructions or tips for inserting them. Battery life is short. I will probably send them back to Amazon, if I can't figure out how to get them to stay in my ears.  Please note that these hard plastic ear buds are covered with a soft plastic cover that has the little doogies sticking up that are supposed to make the ear buds stay in your ear. These plastic covers slide off and/or fall off constantly, and without them, there is no way these ear buds will stay in your ears.  Amazingly, what Amazon leaves out of the product description is the little clip attached to the wire that lets you clip the device to your shirt collar so that you don't lose it after the ear buds have fallen out of your ears and you are too busy to try to put them back in.  This is an honest and reliable opinion for which no free product was provided, no promotional consideration given, and the only money thst changed hands was my buying this product at full price, which I hope I will get back when I return the product to Amazon.
