It came on the expected day and packing was quite good.<br />The stand is rigid and stable as it boasts. My kids loading it with 3-4 books but not collapsed or overturned.<br /><br />Unfortunately the middle section of the stand is stuck from the first day and very very hard to push in to the bottom part (i.e. telescopic action no more there) and I had to apply lot of pressure/force to revert it back and from second time not working at all. So only the top section moves. Looks like middle does not operate with the yellow button lock. Don't know whether this is a product defect or problem specific to my item. So I cannot put it in to the bag or carry anywhere.<br /><br />I haven't return this it troubles me to pack it back and now using as a home stand.<br /><br />I am giving only 2 stars since my purpose is lost.
