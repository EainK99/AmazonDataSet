Our middle school band teacher specifically recommended these sticks--the Vic Firth ones pictured with the flag logo near the bottom.  What we received were the same model number but different sticks--the Vic Firth \\"50th anniversary\\" logo sticks.  Band teacher was disappointed and said that the commemorative sticks are generally inferior quality.  I'm following up with Amazon about the bait and switch.  I expected to get the product that was pictured.
