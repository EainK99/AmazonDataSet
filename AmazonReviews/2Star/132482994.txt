For a more technical review, see the other reviews by audiophiles.  I am just a non-technophile that loves good sound.<br />These are just too bass heavy!  I found the heavy bass extremely annoying.<br />The headphones are fairly heavy but not uncomfortable.<br />Sound isolation is good.<br />The cord comes with a handy screw on adapter for 1/4 inch plugs that goes over a mini plug.<br />There is no volume adjustment on the heaphones or cord.<br /><br />Overall, I'd pass on these unless you are listening to hip hop or other very base heavy music.
