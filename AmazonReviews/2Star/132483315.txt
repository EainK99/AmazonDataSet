the good: the flute is well detailed<br />the bad or what I didn't like about it: it was silver tone but it was not a jewlery quality.  the color/shine was not present.  The necklace feels and looks like it is made out of metal.  I would not be able to give this as a present to anybody who are older than 13.  I believe I over paid, and will try to return the product if possible.
