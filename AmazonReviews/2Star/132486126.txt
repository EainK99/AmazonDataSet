I have gone through at least six of these since they came out.  They only last about six months.  The build quality is awful, the wires are wrapped in cheap rubber and there are no boots in areas that get a lot of wear.<br />Additionally, if you wear your headphones with the cord over the back of the ear and past the back of your neck you can't use the remote on the left without switching the left and right cables.  So, now my left headphone is playing the right channel, and vice versa.<br />There are some good things, Shure's warranty process is easy, and I just send mine back and I get a new one shortly.  The buttons work as expected and other than it falls apart, it does what it is supposed to do.<br />I keep going back and buying these because I love my Shure headphones (SE425) and have been using Shure headphones for over 5 years.  I wish the build quality of this cable would match the build quality of their other items.
