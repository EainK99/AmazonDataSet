I'm just picking the trumpet back up, but I get a lot of intonation issues with this thing. Almost 3/4 of a step difference in an octave. A lot of backpressure, too. Some of it could be to my embouchure being crap, but this did not meet my expectations at all. I can barely practice with this thing just because I have a hard time &#34;trusting&#34; when I am sharp versus what the mute is doing.
