Guitar had chips in paint on body of guitar as well as on edge, as if it was set on its edge when finish was wet!<br />Other parts are OK for the price....should have had quality control before shipping to ensure it was in good condition.<br />Very disappointed....maybe that is why it is called Directly CHEAP!
