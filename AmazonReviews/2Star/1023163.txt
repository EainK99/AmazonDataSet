This cable did not have the same pinout as my other XLR 3 pin female to 1/4&#34; TRS connector cables. Using a cable tester, both of these cables I purchased had a different, and unusable pinout. For instance, this was not the same pinout as Monoprice 104767 also sold by Amazon for a similar price.   The Monoprice 104767 works in all of my audio setup where XLR female mono audio connects to TRS 1/4&#34; mono. Unfortunately, the DS18 cable didn't work in any of them, so I am returning both. Perhaps there is a need for the pinout implemented in these cables, but I haven't found it, so I'll leave it at 2 stars.
