Start by saying the Fender picks are fine, but I could have bought them cheaper if I wasn't drawn in by the decorative tin. There lies my beef. The description states the product demensions as 5.5x5.5x5.5 inches. They mis-read the ruler a smidge. The tin is 2 1/4 x 3 1/8 x 5/8 inches. It doesnt help that the tin was part of a 5 item order of which I recieved 4 because the packaging was laughable. [[ASIN:B002792GCW Fender Make History Pick Tin - 36 Shell Celluloid Guitar Picks]]
