Got this for the keyboard player at our church.  So far she likes it, but I will give one caveat -- if you plan to use this with power cable, the included cable is too short to reach the ground for a stand-up keyboard player's music stand.  I will have to use a USB extension cable.  Only used i tone week, but am satisfied so far.  Also, in case you are wondering, each one of the adjustable arms has 2 leds and its own power button.  Push the button once, and one LED comes on.  Push it again, and both LEDs will be lit.  Push again, and it will turn off.  Update:  Light just over a year before it gave out.  One side of the light just blinks, and the 2 leds blink at different rates. On the other side, only one of the 2 leds still works.  So out of 4 leds, only one is working properly.  Had to replace.
