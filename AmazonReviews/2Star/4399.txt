Got it in April '15 on a scratch-n-dent deal.  The pause/play button is all over the place in whether or it feels like working. Sometimes the music just stops for no reason, or it will just decide to jump to another part of the song. If I had more money, I would throw this POS out the window. Will let you know what Gemini does to make it right. I now see other brands new units for cheaper than I bought this for used.  I don't need a fancy one. But one that plays is a good start.
