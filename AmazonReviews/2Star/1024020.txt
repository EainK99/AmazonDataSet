I thought I was &#34;upgrading&#34; in quality (etc) from a Sapphire 6 USB 1.1, which in Windows 10 had a habit of going quiet and the only way to fix it was to disconnect and reconnect the USB cable, but 3/4's of the time I did that Windows would crash. My hope was that the Scarlett would be basically the same features I was using but newer and more stable. Turned out the Scarlett 2i2 doesn't even playback nor record in more than 16 bits!! It records with a high enough sample rate but 16 bits?? I initially shrugged it off and tried out the stability. First app I opened I brought up the Asio4All GUI in a VST host, which because of my prior setup was already configured at a higher bit rate, but before I could lower the bitrate back down to 16 bit I got a Windows BSOD (crash)! &#34;USB driver&#34; error! Yikes! So yeah, this Scarlett is already back in its box, now to figure out how to get it off my hands and maybe get some money back somehow.
