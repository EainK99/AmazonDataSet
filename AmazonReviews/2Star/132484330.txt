However the build quality if medium to poor.  Handle it with care, seeing it's it 99% plastic (even the mic socket!!).  The sonic quality is acceptable, and be advised the unit can only sample at 44.1k.  However, it's obviously portable and if that's the primary use it's fine for that.  I was using it with AKG 414 and compared to my usual console preamps the sound is much more &#34;brittle&#34;, but regardless of that, you can't beat the price point for a portable device.  However, as others have mentioned, treat it gently!
