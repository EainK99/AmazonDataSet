Woodworking is amateur. Glue everywhere. Cracked at binding. Coated with something absolutely unmanageable if you plan on dying the wood.<br /><br />With a lot of patience and reimagining the finish a few times it turned out well.<br /><br />If all you want to do is slap some poly on it and give it a quick polish, this may work well.
