All my other guitar stands are Ultra models with the orange rubber tubing.  This one looked fancier, and had a security strap, so I decided to buy one.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of difference between this and the Ultra stands in terms of design, construction, or even weight.  Nevertheless, I can't recall ever having this much trouble with guitars tipping over.  Breathe on it, over it goes.  Look at it, guitar's in the floor.  A flatulent dog?  Guard your guitar!  The security strap keeps the neck from falling out of the cradle, so the guitar and stand kind of spill over as a unit.<br /><br />I'm going to try popping the rubber caps off the legs and pouring some BBs in there for added weight.  I think it's just a question that this stand is a few ounces too light.  It's probably made of steel tubing one gauge lighter or something.<br /><br />I'm on the fence between two stars and three, but the more I think about it, the more I regret the purchase, so I've decided to go with two stars.
