The Magic Sing units have a feature called \\"Voice Assist\\" which turns on a pre-recorded track of someone singing the actual song you are trying to sing.  My wife is Chinese and absolutely loves karaoke.  In China here and her friends and family do this on a regular basis.  It's a Chinese persons night out for drinks and conversation and karaoke!  To them, not having \\"Voice Assist\\" is unheard of?  There is ALWAYS the original singer singing and you follow along.  Chinese people listen to a lot of American music although American's don't listen to any Chinese music.  Chinese people are taught English in school.  Because they are always learning English, not having the English singing to follow along with would make the American songs nearly impossible to sing to.  The problem here is that even this Chinese song chip has very little songs with \\"voice Assist\\" and a Chinese person to sing along to.  My Chinese wife found this so different from what she was used to she returned the Magic Sing console and this Chinese song chip.
