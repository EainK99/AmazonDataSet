Note: Some of this was initially posted as a comment to DonS' review, but I thought I'd post a full review so more people could see it.<br /><br />Experience: We've used these in our 250 seat church for about 4 years. It was the first wireless mic set we bought.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Sound good when they're working.<br />- Good price.<br />- Comes in a nice carrying case (Even just for storing the mics).<br />- I like the 4-in-1 receiver... it sits well on a stack or in a rack.<br />- You can choose to output all 4 mics on 1 cable - frees up channels on your soundboard.**(See Cons)<br />- Or you can use 4 separate lines to the soundboard for easier levels control.<br />- Cheap common AA Batteries (2 per mic). Tight fit.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Batteries are so tight, at first you think they don't fit and you'll break something.<br />- Intermittent drops and static. This is a deal-breaker! See my review below.<br />- When using a single output to soundboard, the levels are much lower and you have to crank it all up to max to get enough sound.<br />- Antennas are purely cosmetic? Point any direction or even remove them both entirely and there's no change in reception.<br />- Batteries last a long time except that static and pops/drops increase as the batteries are used up, so that pretty much cancels out what I first said! You'll be replacing batteries long before their life is drained. (I'm using a battery tester). I'd guess they last about 14-18 hours until battery is \\"drained\\". But you'll probably want to replace them after 8 hours.<br />- Squelch dial seems cosmetic. Didn't notice a change from min to max.<br /><br />===Initial Post: July 24, 2013:<br />We've had this installed in our Church for few years and the receiver was in the sound booth about 50 feet from the small stage. We've always had problems with random moments of hiss and even every few minutes when someone was talking it would go FFFT! and then cut out for a second... Very annoying! Now that I'mthe sound man, I'm trying to figure out why, and it makes sense that it's a range thing. I'm now moving the receiver to the stage, but it means I have to use up 4 lines on the snake! :o( On the bright side, it did seem to get rid of the hiss - I didn't notice it again for the 1 hour I had it back there today.<br /><br />Other weirdness: While testing the receiver in the sound booth, I removed both of the antennas and the reception didn't change at all! Also couldn't see any difference with the squelch dial... it didn't seem to make any difference from min to max.<br />Yes, the batteries are a very tight fit! I didn't notice that Duracells are longer like one review, but you do have to jam the batteries in very tightly!<br />Also, if you use the single cable out to the sound board, it is MUCH lower levels than when each mic has it's own output to the sound board. I had to get way to close to maxing all the sliders/dials in order to get the right volume. You'll want to use 4 individual lines to the sound board!<br /><br />DonS: I'd love to get your recommendation of which Audio Technica wireless mic kit you installed. Thanks!<br /><br />===Update Sept 17, 2013:<br />I had the receiver at the back of the stage for a few weeks and I still had the 'pops' and FFFT where it just cuts out for a second. It was a bit less, but still happened a number of times. Not having the visibility of the receiver to know if mics are on or not was also a downer. Finally I just moved it back to the sound booth. This last Sunday was the last straw...every 5-15 seconds it would go FFT! and cut out for a second, then quickly fade back in... Sure the batteries were a bit closer to the low side, but that's no excuse in my books... It should work perfect until it doesn't work. Slowly getting worse as the battery gets used up is just poor quality build. I don't want to replace the batteries every 4 hours when they still have a lot of their life left in them! I'm done with these VocoPros!<br /><br/>Talking to DonS, he's super experienced with a ton of systems and he suggested the Audio Technica 2000 Series Wireless (Or 3000 series in large cities with lots of radio wave traffic).<br />I wish we could have spent the extra money in the first place - it would be cheaper than buying these VocoPros and THEN buying the AT's! I hope someone can benefit from this review & follow-up and save some money. Feel free to contact me if you have questions. (Post a Comment)<br /><br />===Update Oct 29, 2013:<br />After a bunch of research and reading reviews, I decided to gamble on another cheap mic system before going for the AT 2000 series. I bought the GTD-Audio G-787H Diversity UHF 4x800 Channel Wireless Microphone System. So far after a week of use, it is fantastic. Excellent clear vocals, no static, no drops or cutting out & built-in battery meters on the mic as well as the receiver. Also signal strength meter and levels meter for each mic on the receiver. So far it's a clear winner and I'm thrilled to have found them!!<br />===End Update.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:<br />At a quick glance this system seems great, but after a bit of use - I've come to find that it's disappointing. The guy who purchased these for us said reviews for singing groups were ++ and the only negative reviews were for speaking. Well maybe that's because the music covers up the occasional static or dropped word, but I find that even the speaking in between songs is enough to reveal some glaring issues with this system. The fact that it will randomly \\"pop and cut out for a second\\" is not acceptable. With good batteries and short range to receiver, it would be minimal, but still annoying as ever. I guess it's possible that the frequency they use is not ideal for our area & that the problems are created by interference, but since they are locked to a frequency and you can't change it... it makes the system totally unsatisfactory for me. You will be tempted to buy this system because of the price,but be prepared to deal with these issues. I wish we'd saved our money for something better. If you want to buy a used VocoPro system... I've got one for sale!
