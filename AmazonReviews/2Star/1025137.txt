I wouldn't recommend these speakers the box are really crapy thin material and the speakers are even worst i opened the box up because i wanted to see why it was so light and well it has a tiny magnet on the back looks like it was about to fall  of the speaker are light an cannot handle bass so i replaced them with some American audio and use them to plat mid range they seem to be doing ok but will replace the fist change i get.
