The item itself is exactly what you would expect IF you are looking at the right picture.  At the time I'm writing this, the image on the product page and the image on other pages (for example, the image that I'm looking at now as I'm reviewing the product) are DIFFERENT.<br /><br />In reading another review here, it seems that indeed the item you get in the mail can vary.  Another reviewer said the guiro didn't have a fish-like tail, and the image on the product description page has no tail.  My item DOES have a tail.  It's the very traditional, typical guiro -- two holes, bowling pin-like handle and so on.<br /><br />I did not receive the stick that should come with the guiro.  That's so strange.  I really don't want to return the thing just to get the stick, but note that using a drum stick with this instrument is pretty different from using the smaller stick it's supposed to ship with.  Now I have to go get a stick.  Not fun.<br /><br />I don't know how to contact the seller about this.  At any rate there is no link to do so on my Amazon orders page.
