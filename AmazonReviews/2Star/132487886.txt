I exclusively use LOXX Strap Locks.  They are the only brand I trust and they have never failed me.  I normally buy the models 13611 (chrome) or 13679 (black).  I decided to buy the Skulls model for a bass that has skull and crossbones inlays on the fretboard.  The official product pictures (here on Amazon and on the LOXX site) show the skulls as having red eyes -- what I received has black eyes.  The bare metal finish of the top of the button is very ugly and looks out of place against the black base of the button.  I uploaded a picture of the strap locks I received to the customer images section.<br /><br />The skull strap locks are not up to the standard I have come to expect from LOXX.  They do need to update the official product pictures (here on Amazon and on the LOXX site) to reflect the changes in the eye colors of the skull design.  As it is now, the product received does NOT match the official product pictures.  These LOXX Skulls Strap Locks are on their way back to Amazon for a refund.<br /><br />Although there is a review that states otherwise, the standard length of LOXX Strap Locks do indeed fit fine on Levy's Straps.  I exclusively use Levy's Leathers 2 guitar straps and I have never had an issue with the standard length LOXX Strap Locks.  I will continue using LOXX Strap Locks, but will stick with the 13611 (chrome) or 13679 (black).
