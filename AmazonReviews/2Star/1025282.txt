I bought this product to use for dance parties at a summer camp at which I work.  The first time we used it the kids loved it!!! It lit up almost the entire gymnasium quite nicely.  However, when we got it out for the next party, we found that it would no longer spin.  The lights still work, but what fun are still lights? After taking the globe piece off, I realized that the pieces don't stay together tight enough to allow it to spin.  I really loved this product but am disappointed that it doesn't spin anymore.
