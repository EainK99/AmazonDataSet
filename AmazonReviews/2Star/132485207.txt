I got this driver a few years ago after researching, and updating from an Adat and Garage Band studio to a system with Logic Pro. The driver periodically caused problems with my MacBook Pro 2007, but I was able to work around it and I was happy with it. Having just gotten a new computer in September 2013, I hoped everything would start working great. I'm doing research now and sadly it seems true that there is no updated driver so the machine cannot be used. I'll have to look into a new piece of hardware to buy or wait and hope that a new driver comes along. But reading some of the other comments here, it seems that may not happen any time soon, if at all. M Audio's website states that they don't let you know when a driver will be released. Very frustrating, and concerning to have invested so much money and learned the workflow with this unit, and to not know the next step to take.<br /><br />If I keep this unit, and a new driver comes along, I'll try to remember to come back and update this comment. Or perhaps someone else will add a comment/reply to it.<br /><br />UPDATE: 9-21-13. Although M-Audio's own website is filled with community comments asking for updates or information on drivers and automated responses, it seems like yesterday I was able to get an update (from April 2013) which is currently working on Mac 10.8.4. Today I was able to use Logic for the first time on this new computer with the 2626. I've only opened one project, which I was able to hear. I hope it will continue to work fine. I see there is a Mac upgrade to 10.8.5 available, but I am now nervous to upgrade before researching to see if the M Audio driver will work, given my experience (and that of many users commenting on their website). I have changed my rating from one star to two stars. If there had never been a problem with the drivers, I would have given this unit a solid 3 or even 4 stars.
