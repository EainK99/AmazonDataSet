As far as looks, these decks are very nice. The screen clarity is very sharp. Here are my CONS: The platter has a delay and it locked up on me several times unable to read CDs or thumb drives even after updating the latest firmware. In that case, these decks are not reliable enough for me for what I do.  It's best to save the money up to get perfection.
