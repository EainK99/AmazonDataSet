This is my daughters first year playing the clarinet so I didn't want to spend too much money on it.<br />I noticed that rather than take her shiny, brand new clarinet to school, she was dragging a scratched, worn, school issued clarinet back and forth. When I asked her why she wasn't taking the new one to school, she said it was very difficult to play. I assumed it was because the one from school was &#34;worn&#34; and this one just needed to be broken in. So, last week, when her friend spent the night, I asked her to try it and let me know what she thought about the quality. (Her friend has been in band for 5 years and has played the clarinet for 4 of those) She basically told me that this clarinet is very difficult to play and that some of the finger pieces were broken. It is in the same condition it was when we received it, so I have to assume that it was broken when I got it.<br />I would not recommend this clarinet.
