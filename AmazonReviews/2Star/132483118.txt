First, two hints about assembly.  The screws for assembly are pre-threaded into the legs.  Pay attention to the holes' spacings in the legs, so that internal legs match up with the smaller spaced holes.<br /><br />Having spent 90 + minutes assembling this (after reassembling a couple of times to correct wrong guesses), you should be able to do better.  Also, based on the shipment box, I doubt that this is a Yamaha product.
