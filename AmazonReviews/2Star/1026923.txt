I purchased this, along with several other brands of recorders to test out the quality, to see which brands I could recommend for my students. The intonation and sound quality are alright, about what I expected for an inexpensive plastic recorder. However, the C/C# hole at the bottom is supposed to be offset to the right, and the one I received had them offset to the left. If students are only playing a few notes, usually B, A and G, it's fine. However, I just can't recommend a recorder where all the notes cannot be played correctly.
