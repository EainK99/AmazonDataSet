This cable flat out sucks (It's not Amazon's fault). Yes, it does work (barely), so I gave it two stars. It works with electric guitar, not so well with bass guitar (although I did not get it for my bass). It also works ok with cell phones and/or MP3 players. HOWEVER, the cable is very low quality. If you move the cable around it looses signal. Volume levels vary drastically (volume goes up and down by itself when cable is touched). I also tried it with my [[ASIN:B006XMN7CC GTD Audio Body Pack Transmitter Compatible With G-787 , G-733 Receiver Series]] with a G-787 receiver. I would not recommend this product.
