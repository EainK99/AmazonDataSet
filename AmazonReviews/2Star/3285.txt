Shocked at all the 5 star reviews, the tone, relative pitch, clarity and ringability is mediocre at best. the inside striker part is on a spring that any child can easily pull and ruin. the B and high C were nearly the same pitch, so the bells were not especially in tune. More a toy, easily broken. When Iooked up the cost of real bells I was floored; $4000+ a set for just an octave. So yes, these are just toys, no they don't sound great. No, they won't last long at all. Wish there were more middle ground bells between this crap and the super nice ones.
