I had to return this after one day of use. One of the step LEDs burned out making the entire thing completely useless.  If you lose one led you might not be able to tell which pattern you are on, if there is a step on that pad, is your volume on that pad, etc.  The silicone case is nice and the unit sounds really good. But one LED shorting makes this machine flimsy and delicate. It's supposed to be portable, which you would assume means durable. I find the PO-12 not to be.
