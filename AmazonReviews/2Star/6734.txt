I bought this as a first guitar for two beginner students (brothers in same household). When I unpackaged this guitar I quickly realized that it had no weight to it. What kind of wood is the body of this thing?  It is very light!  I don't think it's half the weight of a Fender Mini Strat. Tuned it up and string buzz on the E, D, and B string. Got to looking at the bridges,  the adjusting screws are so long they interfere with the string going from the string retainer plate to the saddle. Because of this intonation was off on several strings.  Will measure these screws and cut them down to fit. Next are the fret wires. Not a single one is filed to edge. Had to do every one both sides!  Next were the nut slots. Way too high! Can,t play the first two frets. By the time you have the strings down to the fret wire,  you've pulled the string out of tune. And for a student, it will be almost impossible to play open cords. Will get out the old trusty nut height gauge and get them set. I know this is a CHEEP! (in more ways than one) guitar but go to their adds and web site and you would think they are making gold, and toute their family name as makers of quality guitars. And only guitars. I think they should get into another business!
