I've been using the Blue Yeti (Silver) mic for the last couple years and have been very happy with it. I am an amateur musician and needed something to record to my Mac, for vocals and acoustic guitar. Recently I've been pursuing voice-acting and decided to upgrade. I decided to do a side-by-side comparison of the two, reading the same script and comparing them both dry (no effects) and with compression/EQ plugins. I tried different variations of input/output settings (using Garageband) and going so far as maxing everything out (sampling/bit rates) etc.  I can't say there is a huge difference, but there is a difference. The Pro sounds a little more airy, open and vibrant. My only concern is, even when I max out the sample/bit rates, when I view the file it still shows the standard 44,100 sampling rate. Maybe that's just the highest my computer will show? Also, each time I use the mic that setting seems to get reset and go back to the lower sampling rate. So not sure if there's something I'm missing or not.  At any rate, this is a damn good microphone, but not having a ton of experience with mics (I've had two others) I can't compare it to higher-end pro mics. If you are a podcaster or use Skype, etc. the extra cost of this probably wouldn't make it worth while for the &#34;normal&#34; joe, especially for the little bit of improvement you'll get, but for pro's who need even that little extra edge, I say give this a try.  Update: I've had this mic three years, but I only used it sporadically. I'd say no more than about 10 hours of use, and it has decided to stop working today. I'm so pissed. Won't be another one of these.
