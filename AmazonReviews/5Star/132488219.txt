Purchased this mic for kareoke hobby on weekends. Plugs right in to my laptop wich is plugged in to my Sony home theater surround system and to my 42&#34; LED TV.  That completes my home made Kareoke machine, streaming Youtube videos and singing along the tracks. The mic has a great sound, feals heavy duty. No batteries needed and great price!
