I bought this case because I recently purchased an acoustic guitar (Yamaha FG700S) and the cases available at the store was just not my taste.<br />I was worried that the guitar case would not fit (too big? too small?) my guitar, but it was a perfect fit!<br />The case is very simple, with two pockets in the front to store your music and other guitar gadgets.<br />The straps look sturdy and the case itself has soft padding that isn't as thick as other expensive guitar cases, but does its job of protecting my guitar.<br />The color is black.<br />Also, the company does an excellent job of packaging it by putting in a gigantic box...full of padding papers to make sure it's not damaged during the shipping process (even though it's not a fragile object...anyways...)<br /><br />DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT!
