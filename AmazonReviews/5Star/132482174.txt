Don't let these jaded fools who complain that its a cheap POS fool you. They can't see that brand name pedals are over priced hunks of junk these days. Its quiet, with good amount of squash (funk and rhythm players will love it) and gig worthy. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />May I use this moment to list a few I have just to establish credentials? 2 Ross Orange Phasers (78 and 79) 1989 Boss BF2 Flanger (Japanese version) and 1991 USA BF2 as Maxon OD808 ProCo Rat II and others. I've spent hundreds on pedals and pennies on cheap ones I thought might be cool.<br /><br />Try one, they sound great.
