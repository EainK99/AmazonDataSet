I had an old Marshal practice amp from the late 80s that I had been using for many years. It served its purposes, but after so many years the pots just wore out. Snap, crackle, pop, and I about rammed my foot through that amp on more than one occasion.<br /><br />But this new amp? Wow. I'm not a good guitarist. I perhaps qualify as mediocre at best. Though, this amp makes me sound amazing.<br /><br />Adding tones I downloaded from the FUSE community was a breeze, and I see all kinds of knobs and adjustments to tweak, but have not touched them yet. Not sure it is even necessary to do so. Once you have some solid tones, you only need to crank the volume knob up until things on the walls start to rattle. Then start playing. I like that. Simple.
