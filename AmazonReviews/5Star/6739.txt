When this bag first came, I was honestly pleasantly surprised. I was looking for something that was lightweight, could fit my Traktor Kontrol S4, all the while protecting my gear and holding all necessary cables and what nots. Not only does the bag have nice padding and protection for my S4, but it also comes with a laptop compartment (SO useful and handy) as well as compartments in the front that come with extra pockets inside that designate a spot for either headphones, wires, and even USB's which I thought was really great.<br /><br />The whole bag feels extremely sturdy and when I pack my bag up with everything, it still feels relatively light<br /><br />Also the option to either use this bag as a backpack, suitcase, or even an over-the-shoulder type bag is really great depending on the situation.<br /><br />Would highly recommend to anyone who needs a good traveling case for a Traktor Kontrol S4
