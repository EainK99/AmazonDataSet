This is a great amp from a legendary company. I have tried my share of combo amps and most sound tinny. The grit and gain in this amp is as close to genuine as it gets. Models are are wide open for your tweeting and adjusting and revamping. The online features are intuitive and easy to use, with an almost unending list of downloads to choose from. LOUD is an understatement, you could easily mic this for small to medium venues. A must have amp for the starter and intermediate enthusiast.
