I have installed two of these pickups. One in a Big Baby Taylor, the other in a Fender Kingman. Both guitars are on the inexpensive side, but the sound I get out of these guitars with the K & K pickup can rival my higher end Taylors and Martins! The first pickup I installed, I followed the instructions precisely. However, when installing in the Kingman, I got a bit impatient and placed the sensors in the \\"general\\" vicinity of correct. Still, the installed pickup sounds great!<br /><br />I suggest using an external pre-amp to dial in exactly what you are looking for. I roll off the upper mids a bit, which suits my taste. However, the pickups work fine plugged directly into a PA or amp too.<br /><br />I plan on buying another one of these, just to have around.
