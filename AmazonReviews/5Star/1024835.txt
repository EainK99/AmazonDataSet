This ukulele case is extra thick. Which I wanted. It's not much bigger than the other thinner cases being sold. So taking it on a plane will not be a problem. But I'm sure that eventually someone in my family will squish the case with the ukulele in it, and I'll be glad I got the extra padding. The sewing and construction are first rate, and the handy adjustable straps on the back and on the side makes it easier to carry. The small zippered storage compartment will hold a few items like the strap and tunner, but not much in the way of sheet music unless you fold it up. But that's what we use our smart phone for... All in all a good little protective case. Well worth the price.
