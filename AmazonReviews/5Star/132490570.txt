I ordered this item for my son who had just gotten a ukulele for his 10th birthday - didn't want a hard case but something soft, nice looking, and easy to carry. This Eddy Finn gig bag fits my son's soprano pineapple uke perfectly without much room to spare - but not too snug, either! The material feels nice and soft, and we love the pattern & colors (though the full-length red stripe is only on the back!). The 'crinkle'-sound that other reviewers had mentioned is not bothersome, at all- in fact it's barely noticeable, and probably stems from a (very) thin, sewn-in padding. There's a small zippered pocket in the front of the bag (about 7 1/2&#34; x 6 1/2&#34; which can hold a tuner or small book), and straps for carrying as a backpack are also an added plus. My son likes this bag very much and keeps his ukulele inside it - much to my husband's dismay who thinks that he'll play it less, now because he has to &#34;undress&#34; it, first!
