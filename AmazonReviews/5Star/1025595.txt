These mesh heads are the best upgrade to an electronic drum kit. I replaced the stock drum heads on the Alesis DM5 Pro Kit with these and the difference is superb. The bounce on the heads is that of a drum head on an acoustic drum kit. The sound of the pads is greatly reduced and adds a sleek look to the drum kit.
