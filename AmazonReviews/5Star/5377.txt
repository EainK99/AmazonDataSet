It came a few hours earlier than expected, and everything was perfect. The case came in a box from Protec and<br />inside was the cello bag with a plastic casing over it and you can tell the material of the case is nice and sturdy. The padding<br />is very thick so it's a very good buy. The cello bag itself has lots of utilities- pockets for your music, your bow, straps so you can wear<br />it like a backpack, etc. 10/10/ would recommend to anyone who is looking for a non-expensive but VERY sturdy &#34;soft&#34; case.
