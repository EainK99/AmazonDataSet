My guitar gear used to make a lot of noise, especially because the electric system in Brazil is not grounded.<br /><br />I decided to purchase a couple of these beauties and it really did its job!<br /><br />Main features:<br /><br />- very, very light (feels like there's nothing inside it)<br />- very, very small (same size, if not smaller, than a regular pedal)<br />- does not require a power supply<br /><br />Today, I'm going to try it with my ear monitor system.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it for all and any types of gears.
