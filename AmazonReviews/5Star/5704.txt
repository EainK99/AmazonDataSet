One of my vocal chords was paralyzed during surgery to remove my thyroid because of cancer.  This little microphone has saved me so many times! I teach a music class and thought I would have to give it up. But with this baby I can manage 20+ toddlers for an hour and still have a voice the rest if the day. And the battery lasts forever.
