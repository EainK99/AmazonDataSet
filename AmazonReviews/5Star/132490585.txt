I was going into my local guitar shop to buy a set of acoustic strings and wandered into the \\"BASS\\" room (im a guitarist since 14 but have been playing bass the past 5 years in my new band) I have always religiously been an \\"ibanez\\" guy .... but when i picked this bass up i got a chill that came over me that i had to have it. It felt right, played great, looked sharp and what really sold me was the individual string anchors.... its not a \\"solid\\" bar bridge thus helping with string \\"crosstalk\\" (usually reserved for much more expensive instruments). The one i played was a used model in mint condition so the price was incredible for, what i think, is a pretty good quality instrument. Look, i dont claim to be this great bass player or very knowledgeable craftsmen, but this bass was well worth the price as a matter of fact i wouldve paid full price for this. Are there better basses out there? SURE there are. But this one, In my opinion, is excellent!
