Buying this quality of guitar over the internet was sketchie, but the price that my Amazon Prime account afforded me was just to good to pass up, Thanks Amazon Prime.<br /><br />The Montana Songwriter was shipped promptly and is in fine working order.  I can truly see the huge difference between the quality of this Gibson Montana over the other hundred dollar guitars I own.  It has a good action and very clear tone through out all ranges of playing. Beauty!
