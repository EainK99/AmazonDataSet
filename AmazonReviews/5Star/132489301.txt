This is my first ukulele. I was between purchasing this one and the Kala Dolphin, and I'm glad I chose this one. It's got a more mature feel to it. The strings were pretty cheap but I switched them out for a brand that I can't remember (people suggested it on the internet.) I love this ukulele, doesn't feel cheap at all and is a great beginning ukulele. Looks really nice too.
