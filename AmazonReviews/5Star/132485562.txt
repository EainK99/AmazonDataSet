About me: I am a part time working musician and use my equipment at Festivals and bars.<br /><br />Pros: Very portable. Easy set up. Wide tray (holds a thick three ring binder securely) that locks in place. Secure three leg stand. Easy height adjustment with plenty of travel.<br />Cons: tray and back are made of plastic. They are sturdy, you just need to be careful.<br /><br />I have been using this stand for several weeks, folding/unfolding and it has been great. The tripod is VERY stable, the tray is wide and easily holds my 3 ring binder. I have used it at a festival in moderate wind and had no issues. I love how quickly it sets up and how compact it is. I can now carry: stand, guitar and stool in a single trip! This pretty much covers the gigs where the PA is already provided.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this item.
