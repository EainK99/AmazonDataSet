This Overdrive Pedal works great ! I started Using this pedal at my Gigs and everybody in my band said it sounded good, It gave my amp a nice crunch ,,,my friends at work can't believe I like Behringer Pedals, I buy them cuz they sound good and the price is right , all my behringer pedals worked great right out of the box, never had any problems , good pedals , great price , ships quick, a good deal, go for it !!!Guitarzan
