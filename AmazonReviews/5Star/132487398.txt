I bought this a year or so ago, having already owned several ocarinas. This is one of my favorites and absolutely lovely to play. I even took it to a class at college and everyone was totally enraptured by it. In regards to tone, it is lower than a tenor ocarina and has a very mellow sound, almost like a dove. You won't hurt your ears playing this (unless using the highest notes, but even then it's unlikely). The air required is pretty steady throughout, making it less challenging than some of my others. I think anyone could learn on this instrument. It fits comfortably in your hands so you don't have to worry about it slipping or feeling unnatural. All in all, if you're looking for an instrument that is high quality, easy for beginners, and has a lower range, definitely pick this up. The price deterred me at first but absolutely go for it if it seems like a good fit. It's worth every cent.
