it works perfect for me, previously i have bought a warm yellow led bulb 9 w, but two things happens, one, i don't like the yellow light, and two, 9 watt wasn't enough to illuminate the room properly, my living room is 4.5x5 m (14.76x16.40ft) and it feel darker.  But dont worry, i use the 9 watt yellow bulb in my night lamp, and looks cool =).<br />With this bulb, 12 watts, cool white, makes my living room more comfortable.  Cant wait to buy another to use them on my house.<br />And finally, it saves you a lot of money =).
