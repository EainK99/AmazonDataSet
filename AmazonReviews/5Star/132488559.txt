*Portability*<br />I wanted a very small lightweight yet versatile amp I could literally toss on the back of a motorcycle with my Kala Ubass & use at bluegrass jams and other small informal gatherings.<br /><br />*Volume*<br />I bought this to use while playing in groups with mostly acoustic instruments. If your instrument must be amped to hear yourself (like the Ubass), when you pull out an amp the banjo & mandolin players are not going to be happy with you. At least with this tiny little thing its small enough that no one really raises any objections. Then, once they realize I am just using only enough volume to be heard & to blend in, everything is fine. If you need it, this amp does have surprisingly good volume - It's not going to blow the doors off the barn, but you should not expect it to. If you want big and loud, buy something else. I wanted something that sounded good while using fairly low volume yet loud enough to be heard when I wanted to turn it up, while also being physically small, lightweight & made for bass frequencies. In other words, this amp is perfect for my needs.<br /><br />*Features*<br />Every feature on this amp works very well and it is a lot of fun to play around with all the different effects. When actually playing with other people I play flat (no effects) to get the most natural sounds from the Ubass. Occasionally I will put in a little something extra just bc I can, and to liven things up a bit ;)  Overall tone sounds great no matter what settings you use.<br /><br />*Summary*<br />This is also a great little practice amp. I needed a new practice amp anyway so this fits that spot too. I only wish it had a lineout, that would make it perfect for so many more uses. If it had a lineout I could use it onstage sometimes instead of lugging my main amp around. I knew it did not have a lineout when I bought it, so can't ding a star for that. But If I could wave a magic wand over it & change anything, that one thing would make this amp pure awesome, and it's already pretty great.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this purchase.
