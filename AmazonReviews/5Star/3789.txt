This is a wonderful DVD!  I have been playing the bodhran for about 6 months.  I was using the DVD that was suggested to me when I purchased my drum.  Needless to say, there were some issues.  Within the first 3 minutes of this DVD, John solved my problems.  He takes you step by step, and addresses any issues right away.  He emailed me to let me know when the DVD was coming, and told me I could contact him with any questions. Of course, I haven't bothered him, but it's nice to know he is willing to help.  I would highly suggest this DVD for anyone who would like to learn to play the bodhran.
