For years I put on my strings, messed around with the nut, frets and truss rod, futzed with my bridge and saddle, and generally wandered around in the dark trying to take care of my guitars and make them as playable as possible. Let's just say I had a limited amount of knowledge and, really, none of the tools I needed. YEARS I did this. Then, just a month ago or so, I took a shot at this item and EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. This is now the single most indispensable tool on my amateur's workbench, and I'd bet my last tuning peg that it's true for professional luthiers and set-up masters as well. This thing is amazing. So much CRUCIAL information available in one easy-to-use, well-made tool.<br /><br />If you want to set up your instrument the RIGHT way, you can do it MUCH easier with this thing -- I'm not sure how I got along without it; my guitars are in such better shape and all it took was a little boning up on the basics and this wonderful tool.<br /><br />Five unabashed stars for this gem.
