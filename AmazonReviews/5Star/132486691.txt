Put this in the bridge position of my Indonesia made Squier Vintage Modified Telecaster Special. The guitar came with a Duncan Designed TE-101B single-coil bridge pickup and a Duncan Designed JM-101N single-coil in the neck position. I replaced the stock neck pickup with a Duncan SJM-2 Hot Jazzmaster.  Replacing the stock bridge pickup was a bit trickier than replacing the neck pickup.  The three mounting holes for the Seymour Duncan Quarter Pound for Tele STL-3 Lead (Bridge) Pickup do not line up with the baseplate that comes with the stock pickup.  The baseplate is essential to grounding the pickup. Also, the stock pickup was screwed to the baseplate plate with two small screws that insert into two holes in the bottom of the pickup.  The STL-3 has only one hole in the center of the bottom of the pickup.  To make this change work, I had to enlarge the three holes in the bottom of the STL-3 with a drill to give me enough play to line up with the three holes in the baseplate. Once I had the three mounting screws in place through the pickup and the base plate, I heated the base plate with a 1200 watt hair drier to melt some residual wax left on the stock baseplate. I then use one screw from the stock pickup to screw the baseplate to the new pickup and added some hot glue around the edges.  Everything works fine after the modification and the STL-3 sounds great by itself and in tandem with the SJM-2; much better than the stock pickups.  My Squier now kicks butt. The product arrived from the seller on the scheduled delivery date via the USPS.  If you are handy with guitar mods, this is an excellent way to improve your guitar's sound with a DIY project.
