I bought this product used and the remote came lacking a battery, so that is kind of a bummer, but I ran it for a few hours last night and it was very cool. I couldn't believe how large the &#34;web&#34; was with the laser sitting about 12 feet from the wall. Definitely will move it closer to get a more concentrated effect. For just $100 it is a very good product. I have mine set up in the same room as a Chauvet Min laser RGX 2.0. Next in my collection will be a Min laser RGB!
