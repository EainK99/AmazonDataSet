Get it. If your kick is moving or your kick pedal is moving this is the rug. I played the other night and my pedal wasn't even attached to the kick. Didn't move. The pedals velcro just kept it in place. I certainly need to get the pedal fixed but this rug is going to save my life every time. Not super thick but I can't complain. The block is great and the waited corners aren't too shabby. Best purchase I have made in a while.
