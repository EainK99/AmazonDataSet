Upton recommends the Dampit.  I'll take their word for it.  I ordered and received the Dampit brand - no problems with a substitute humidifier.  I got what I ordered.<br /><br />LISTEN:  Test this out before you go sticking it in your bass (or any other stringed instrument).  Find out just how much water will leak out if you don't properly wring out the humidifier.  I tested it and was surprised that it started dripping after a few minutes.  My fault.  I hadn't wrung it out enough.  Check out the Upton YouTube video on what happens if your humidifier leaks into the bass.
