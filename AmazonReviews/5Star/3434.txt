[[VIDEOID:448312112a89935345b3762987e2f28f]]I was so excited to get this microphone system in time for our back to school kick off at work.  We had several speakers as well as many talent acts use these microphones.  Because there were children involved, I am not allowed to show that portion of the video but I can tell you the mics worked wonderfully!  We had a relatively small venue in comparison to some but really needed a mic to be able to be heard in the back and over the commotion of some of the kids.<br /><br />It was extremely easy to set up to the mixer system.  Basically plug in a couple cords and we were ready to roll.  I had previously charged up both mics although we only needed one during the event.  I was able to get about 75-80 feet away before I heard any crackling at all on the mic.  The rest of the time it was crystal clear with no interference or high pitched beeping that you sometimes hear.  It even worked well when the kids were singing into it.<br /><br />If you watch my brief video, I show you an up close view of the mic unit itself with all the different jacks, knobs, and buttons.  It's a very straight forward system which is why I think it was so easy to use.  You have your power button and volume knobs in the front and your balanced/unbalanced jacks in the back.  You have the wells for charging the mics on top and the antennas for each in the back as well.<br /><br />Are these the best mics around for professional recording?  Perhaps not but if you need a great set for presentations and other events that need good sound quality and a decent range, these are definitely a nice choice!  I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.
