I could start by saying don't buy Beets; so I will. For the extra bit of cash this set of headphones will sound better, last longer, and look better. Nice thick cable with an add-on end cover for the larger outputs such as Amps, and Home Theatres. The title wouldn't fit my sound assessment entirely though; so for audophiles; The sound has a very wide array, but seems a little lacking across the spectrum rather equally. I've found boosting it with a pocket amp is helpful, but is not perfect. That said plugging these things into my phone makes the phone speakers sound like their playing 90's midi files in comparison. Did you know FF Dimensions music was performed by an orchestra? I wouldn't have without these things. Great buy.
