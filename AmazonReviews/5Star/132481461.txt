This product is compact and collapses small enough to fit in a backpack easily.  I bought this to hold Law textbooks and the page guards are stable enough to keep the books in place so I can read more easily.  The stand is very adjustable and pretty stable given how portable it is.  If you want it to be more stable I would recommend getting a heavier one however.
