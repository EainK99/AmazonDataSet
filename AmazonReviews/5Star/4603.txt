What a great little tuner.  I guess I've bought 6 or 7 by now, I've only broken one, (my bad) and have given the bulk to friends.  I use it every time I play and have not had to change the battery ever.  It's a little sluggish recognizing the low E on a bass, but it finally does after a second or 2.
