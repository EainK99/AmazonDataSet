I was restoring a '41 Radio King snare with a three-point strainer, and it was missing the original snare wires. PureSound discontinued the snare wire specifically designed for that model, but I was able to find the clam shell version in stock. Since what I really needed it for was the additional length of the wire section, I put this clam shell version on a drill press and created two more holes at each of the wires for the string to go through. Worked out great. Maybe it'll work out for others with a similar requirement.
