This is an excellent and extremely well-made guitar, which is perfectly suited for the beginning or casual guitar player. Regardless of its laminate construction, you should consider purchasing this guitar for your child or yourself, because this company has been around for centuries (since the 16th Century - no joke!), making student and professional grade musical instruments. It is the oldest musical instrument manufacturing company in Europe.<br /><br />Yes, it is from the Czech Republic, but as previously mentioned, it is a quality instrument, more than comparable to Yamaha. In fact, I own a Strunal 4655, as well as a Yamaha student guitar, and the Strunal is superior in design, endurance, sound and playability. The Yamaha keeps going out of tune and has an extremely dull sound, whereas the Strunal sounds like some Rodriguez guitars I have played, beautiful tone, great variance of sound (extremely loud to very soft) with no reduction in beauty, and a gorgeous look to it. No chips, nicks, or visible distractions. On the other hand, the Yamaha had glue sticking out in too many places, chips on the body of the guitar, and loose parts.<br /><br />If you are deciding on a beginner's guitar, or simply want a guitar to pick up after years of not playing, you will not go wrong with the purchase of this guitar. It is well worth the price!
