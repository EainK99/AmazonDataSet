Having used the Remo Kid's Percussion line at a toddler music class, I was impressed with these REAL instruments that help to encourage children to create music. I was excited to bring them into our home and my son has enjoyed them ever since.<br /><br />These drums have real drumheads and sturdy bases, making them ideal for the rough-and-tumble play of toddlers. While we're working on learning how to treat our instruments properly, it's nice to know that these are able to take a beating and still look good as new. I've even found my son STANDING on his bongos and they did not break or tear.<br /><br />The cost is high, but you won't need to buy them again- making these Remo drums a great value if you're looking to invest in long-term toys that will see your kiddo through their childhood.
