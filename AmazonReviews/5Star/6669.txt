I was surprised at the quality of this gig bag considering the price.  It fit my old Yamaha dreadnought perfectly, and I'm confident that when I carry it around, it's safe.  Solid structure and padding - stands on its own.  Lots of pockets, big enough to store sheet music, tuners, capos, extra strings... I would absolutely recommend this bag.
