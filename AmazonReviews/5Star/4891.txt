My Taylor developed a split in the soundboard last winter.  I thought it had been dropped, but it was dry wood.  I was able to restore the humidity and the split closed up - you can barely see it in the finish.  The humidipak system maintains the humidity perfectly now.  Soaks up excess, releases moisture when needed.
