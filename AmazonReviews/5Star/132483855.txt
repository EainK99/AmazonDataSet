I purchased this sub to piggy back off of a Peavey PV115D powered main to be used for DJ gigs.  I wanted a 15 inch sub that sounded good and did not break my back or my bank.  The poly cabinet and recessed handles make it easy to carry around and at less than 40lbs, it goes easy on my back.  The 400 watts of program power is a perfect for what I need and the thumping is impressive for a 15 inch speaker. I have to note is that this sub does NOT need a crossover as it ignores anything above 140mhz.  I run it through a sonic maximizer for an even more impressive effect.  If you're in the market for a sub and don't need an 18 inch monster, I highly recommend you take a look at this little beast.
