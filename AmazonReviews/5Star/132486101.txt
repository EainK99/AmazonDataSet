Use it outdoors at small to medium gatherings and 4 piece band.  Plenty of power. Also used indoors in a large steel outbuilding to practice out of.  The iPhone jack is incredibly handy as now I simply plug my phone or iPad into it and have a great sound system either with my mp3's or pandora.  A truly great piece of equipment. Very portable as well.
