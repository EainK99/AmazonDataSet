I purchaseed drum p<br />ad set for my twelve(12) year old grandson to use instead of banging any and everything. Well, it works great with the adjustable heights, he's a short guy. Wonderful sound suppression, and really kept him interested in drums while everyone else can undisturbed. Great sturdy product, and packaged so nothing could be damaged. It arrived as scheduled, really a great trouble free transaction.
