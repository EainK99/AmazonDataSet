This lovely device has given me sounds that I've been longing for. Clean, quiet, it can be lush or subtle, crisp or soft. Easy to use. Being able to view the delay time setting as BPM has unexpectedly been very useful. I do sometimes wish it had the audio tapping feature that other TC Electronic delays have, but that is a minor complaint.
