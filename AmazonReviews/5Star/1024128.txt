So far I'm very happy with this guitar.  I've been shopping on and off for a new classical guitar for a few years, as the one I own is a very low-end student model.<br /><br />Based on my preference and research, I was looking for a spruce top with all solid wood for the back and the sides.  This and a couple other guitars made the short-list, but I'll admit I had a tough time finding them to play locally.<br /><br />I decided to pull the trigger on this one via Amazon, because I'm very familiar with the C&oacute;rdoba brand, and although I rarely return anything, Amazon is very easy and friendly to work with if I didn't like the instrument.<br /><br />Shipping was quick, and the guitar was protected inside a C&oacute;rdoba polyfoam case (not quite as rugged as a good hard case, but it's a canvas wrapped, zippered case).<br /><br />I restrung the guitar immediately, and also put a humidifier in it.  For some reason they put a silica gel packet inside the body of the guitar...<br /><br />It sounded amazing on day one, and it's light years ahead of my old classical.  Now that it's properly humidified, it sounds even better!  The fretboard is very wide and flat, so if you're more used to electrics and/or traditional acoustics, you may want to consider a crossover model.  I use it for all styles, but specifically got it to start playing more classical and Latin music.<br /><br />As far as looks go, the guitar is also very beautiful.  There is a glossy finish covering the whole body, and the rosette is inlaid with mother of pearl and ebony (not just a decal like a lot of budget models).<br /><br />Final thoughts: this is a relatively cheap guitar, when you consider how much you can spend on a classical.  With that said, it sounds and plays like a much more expensive instrument.  C&oacute;rdoba doesn't skimp on the materials on these, but they are able to offer them at such an attractive price because they are built in China (under close supervision of C&oacute;rdoba luthiers, supposedly).  I've played for almost 20 years, and I can't find anything about this guitar that disappoints me.  I'm sure if you are a concert guitarist, this may fall a little short of your expectations, but that's going to come with significant expense!played for almost 20 years, and I can't find anything about this guitar that disappoints me.
