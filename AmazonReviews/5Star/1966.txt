I've gone through my share of headphones and these are the best pair I've owned to date. The bass is exceptional and everything sounds so clean no matter the level the volume is at. You can hear every instrument loud and clear. The fact that the fold is also pretty cool. They are very comfortable I've worn them for hours at a time and theyve never bothered me. They are well built and not flimsy at all.  The extra cords really come in handy as well. I am completely satisfied with this purchase
