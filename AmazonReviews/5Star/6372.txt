Have logged only a few minutes on this pBone...it's amazing, considering I'm not that easily impressed! I used the included plastic mouthpiece; i wonder what my brass mouthpiece will play like on this. I could see using it on a gig. The only caveat is that it plays in a 'stuffy' manner, but this is no surprised in that it won't vibrate like metal does. But hey, just clip a wireless mic to the bell and your good to go. Also, this thing weighs 1/2 to 2/3 less than its brass counterpart. Way to go, Jiggs!
