I used this on bass guitar over the weekend. Love this pedal, especially for the price!  I'm actually on a mission now (thanks to this pedal) to simplify my pedal setup. Let's face it, unless you're The Edge, why do you need 100 different chorus settings? This adds the perfect amount of character to your tone. You can make it very subtle, all the way up to a nice warble. It also has a rubber cap that goes over the adjustment knob, so you can turn the knob with your foot on the fly.
