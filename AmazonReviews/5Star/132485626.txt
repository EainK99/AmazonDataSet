I have bought Hohner Harmonicas for many people, aged 2 thru 70 & everyone seems to delight in the simplicity of making music with little or no experience. You can't get a better &#34;bang for your buck&#34; than a harmonica; hours & hours of fun & enjoyment! Watch the face of a small child when they discover that the music is being made by them!
