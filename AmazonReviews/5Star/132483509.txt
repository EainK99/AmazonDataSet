I am amazed that such a small package can have such full sound. These monitors are being used as general purpose speakers for musical enjoyment and not studio work. With that said my friend has the 6's and my other buddy has a set of 8's all gen2 KRK, I got the 5's for the reason that the room they are in is around 10x11 and they fill it wonderfully. Some would argue that using studio monitors as general purpose audio is overkill and that mastered music is not their intended purpose, but as I sit here listening to I could write a book with the horns blasting, I say so what. If you have the opportunity to purchase a set at a good price point I say go for it. If I need I will update this review, but I am hoping not to.
