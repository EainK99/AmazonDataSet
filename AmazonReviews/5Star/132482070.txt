I don't see what people are complaining about. Sure, the mic positioning and adjustments need some getting used to, but that's not a problem of this set. You can barely rent all these stuffs for a day at this price, and these have worked unfailingly for over a dozen shows for my team ...<br /><br />I am perfectly happy with these and will most highly recommend this set any day. The transmission, reception, mixing, all works great and flawlessly.
