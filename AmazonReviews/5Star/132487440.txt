I will admit I bought these based on looks AND other reviews.  I don't notice if something is not the best sound quality unless it is especially tinny or buzzy or brassy, which these are not.  Either way, these are nice looking headphones that fit my budget and my head, which admittedly is large..er.  I thought they have good sound reproduction overall.  Another plus is my husband would never put these on his head based on how they look.  I had another pair (different brand) that have been worn to pieces, literally, by him.  He IS an audiophile and the complaints about those have been never ending.  I am glad to see them gone. And it gave me a chance to by myself a new pair! Very happy with these.
