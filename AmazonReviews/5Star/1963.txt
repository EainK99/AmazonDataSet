Update 9/7/15:  You know, weird thing... I originally bought my LPM that was of a lighter color, it was brown , same as the color in the back... And it had the hologram in the back... I recently returned it because the finish was chiping, and they gave me a new one that is waaaay darker in color, and it does not have the hologram in the back, is this because it's older? The manufacture date says 9/14 ... Is that on the older side ? Did I get one that is not fully featured? Now I regret returning the original guitar I fell in love with.../:/  Awesome, amazing guitar... Blown away by the quality and attention to detail... And of course... The SOUND! But mine, I got a chip on the finish and I swear that happened inside the case... I had just cleaned it and it was all perfect, then I took it out and it had a big ol chip.... Such a shame, very beautiful finish
