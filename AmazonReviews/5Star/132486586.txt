I've been looking for a singing bowl for a while but was concerned about the high price of most bowls.  The glass/quartz bowls are beautiful and sing loudly but are also prone to being broken.  This fact lead me to the bronze ones.  The bowl arrived promptly.  As I was unwrapping it I thought it was more the size of a cup than a bowl.  After unwrapping, I sat the on the silk cushion and gave it a tap with the mallet. It has a beautiful tone. I started using the mallet and the bowl sings beautifully.  The bowl is a beautiful work of art.  Very happy that I chose this bowl.  As another review mentioned, a little oil on the mallet will bring out the true beauty of the wood.  I also sanded the end of the mallet to remove a small burr.  Very much worth the money compared to others.  Enjoy!!!
