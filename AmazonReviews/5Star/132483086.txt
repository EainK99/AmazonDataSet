I love this tuner. I was worried that it would be too big and it looked a little strange, but it fits nicely and snugly on my ukulele. It's so light that it makes no difference if I leave it on my ukulele. Something nice to have if you don't have the time to look up the notes online. Comes with a batter too. I think it's worth its price.
