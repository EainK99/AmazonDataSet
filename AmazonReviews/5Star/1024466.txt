Simply Beautiful is a compilation of 19 arrangements by 14 different arrangers.  One might assume from the title that these arrangements are an easy skill level, but they are not.  These arrangements vary from late intermediate to moderately advanced (or advanced, depending on who’s doing the rating).  There are many short, 2-page pieces in the collection which is good if you hate turning pages and need a short piece.  Most of the arrangements are new but 5 were previously published.  While the book is mostly made up of hymns, there are 4 original compositions.<br />I like almost all the pieces in this collection.  Most were chosen with the book’s title “Simply Beautiful” in mind.  As such they are not flashy show stoppers but neither are they all slow and meditative.  My favorite piece, and the most advanced the entire collection, is Brad Nix’s “There Is a Fountain”.  It does contain a Maestoso section with octaves and fortissimo dynamics.  Of the original compositions, I enjoy Heather Sorenson’s “Beautiful” and especially Joseph Martin’s “Learning to Walk”.  The latter, which was originally published in Martin’s piano folio, [[ASIN:159235047X Songs of the Journey]], is a delightful, playful piece.  You can immediately picture a toddler taking their first steps and feel their joy in the accomplishment.<br /><br />The arrangements are:<br /><br />1) What a Friend We Have in Jesus, CONVERSE, arr. by Mary McDonald, 2 pages;<br />2) Be Thou My Vision, SLANE, arr. by Cindy Berry, 2 pages;<br />3) ‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus with Only Trust Him, TRUST IN JESUS and MINERVA, arr. by Carolyn Hamlin, 4 pages;<br />4) I Am Bound for the Promised Land, PROMISED LAND, arr. by Lynette Maynard, 3 pages;<br />5) Shades of Dawn, original composition by Harry Strack, 3 pages;<br />6) Softly and Tenderly, THOMPSON, arr. by Shirley Brendlinger, 3 pages;<br />7) I Am His, and He Is Mine, EVERLASTING LOVE, arr. by Dan Forrest, 3 pages;<br />8) Jesus, Keep Me Near the Cross, NEAR THE CROSS, arr. by Vicki Tucker Courtney, 3 pages;<br />9) Shall We Gather at the River?, HANSON PLACE, arr. by Patti Drennan, 3 pages;<br />10) Beautiful, original composition by Heather Sorenson, 2 pages;<br />11) A Reflection on the Cross, HAMBURG, arr. by Heather Sorenson, 5 pages;<br />12) Learning to Walk (Aubrey's Song), original composition by Joseph M.
