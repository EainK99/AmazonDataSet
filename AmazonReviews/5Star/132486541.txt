I was very skeptical ordering a piccolo online, but after receiving it, I am very pleased. The lily pattern and quality of the crystal is beautiful, and I received the piccolo very quickly (4 days) because it was shipped first class. If you're used to playing a piccolo not made of crystal, it will take some readjustment of your omnisure. It is a great piccolo, I am very happy with it.
