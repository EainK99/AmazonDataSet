The unit works well but, I only had a issue with that the mp3 player / blue-tooth only played on one channel. Just had a bad unit, however Amazon will ship a replacement. The unit works well otherwise, it has good drive to the power amp and is clean. The tone controls work very well, the mp3/blue-tooth work of the fourth channel, just read the line switch, the manual skips that point. The other silly thing is the the blue-tooth antenna is on top of the unit is in the way, so this has to be the last/top unit in your rack.
