Received these at Christmas and they have been a great time saver. All my stands are 8mm threaded and they fit well. A note to those who have them popping off during play, you're felts are too thick and cymbals are too tight. This will also eventually cause your cymbals to crack especially if you hit hard. For myself, they cut 2-3 minutes off setup. Gigging musicians know every second counts between sets. If you gig regularly, you definitely need these. Vater Slick Nuts are more expensive but, have a felt attached to the bottom. This may be your deciding factor. They work perfectly for me.
