Perfect for guitars without radiused fingerboards (classical/nylon string, late 19th-early 20th century vintage) AND banjos.<br /><br />Banjoists will enjoy the 84FM's versatility above the 5th fret, where most banjo capos fall short.<br /><br />The faux maple finish is not perfect, but looks quite a bit better than any other capo on the market.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS CAPO for a standard 6-string guitar.  It is made for the minority of guitars that don't have radiused (curved) fingerboards.  Once again, I use it mostly for banjos.<br /><br />Highly recommended....
