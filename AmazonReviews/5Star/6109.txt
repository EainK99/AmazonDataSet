Yes, the sound from this unit is awesome, especially considering its completely passive (non-powered.) I put it in a Seagul Artist cutaway that had a full onboard system, and this simple device actually sounds better. Even so, I was going to give it 4 stars because it just doesn't match up to a Taylor Expression system... but that's not exactly a fair comparison is it? So 5 stars for the K&K Pure Mini !!!
