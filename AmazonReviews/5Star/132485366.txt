Bought this for my older daughter a few years ago and am going to buy one for my 2nd daughter now. It is SO much lighter than the old fashioned hardcover flute case. With how heavy kids' backpacks are these days, it's nice to not have to lug around another heavy item - although admittedly, a flute in general is not that heavy :0<br />I highly recommend this!
