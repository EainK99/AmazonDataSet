Was on the fence between the 8 inch and 10 model. The 10 inch model is still very portable. The side and top handles are a nice touch. Sound quality is very good for the price. The only negatives I can mention are that the power cord ground pin pulled out when unplugging it but since I have lots of spare power cords I wasn't too concerned. Also, the remote for the mp3 player is very weak and needs to be within a few feet to work. I did get some noise when plugging it into a non grounded outlet but that is common for most audio equipment. When connected to a grounded outlet there is almost no hum. I had no trouble daisy chaining two together. When using the MP3 player there are several EQ selections available from the remote and it will also play in random order. I bought two of these and one of them is significantly louder than the other at the same volume setting.<br /><br />Update: I replaced the remote battery and it now has a little more range. Must have come with an old battery.<br />Update 2: My second speaker power cord ground pin pulled out. You should count on replacing the power cords if the outlets you use are tight fitting.
