I have 2 martins and wanted to purchase a bang around/travel guitar.  I originally purchased a Baby Taylor  but found it uncomfortable to play.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money so the Taylor GS mini was not an option.  I found this guitar and figured I would give it a shot and I'm glad I did. It sounds great for a $200 guitar, looks cool, and its comfortable to play.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a travel/beater guitar or for an entry level acoustic.
