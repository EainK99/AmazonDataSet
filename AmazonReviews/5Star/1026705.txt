I highly recommend this to any one who wants to learn to play the violin. It is a starter set it comes with a crappy bow, rosin and strings.  As soon as it came in I took it to a music shop replaced the bridge, strings, bow and rosin. The difference is unbelievable, It has a beautiful sound now the new bow and strings make a huge difference.
