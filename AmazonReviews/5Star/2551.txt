Just the right size for sound & lights cables. I specifically bought them for wrapping up my large extension cords, but they work perfect for any professional cable organizing.<br /><br />I have been a professional DJ for 15 years, and these are my favorite velcro straps of all the ones I have used. I bought an ADJ light fixture and the company sent me just one in the box, and I immediately knew I needed to buy more.<br /><br />CON: The only con is the price, but that's not a big deal when you need professional, high-quality gear.
