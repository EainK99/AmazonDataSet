i worked in the drum dept at guitar center and would always sell this bag to people. it is the best bag you can get for 15$! hands down<br /><br />it is padded, has a decent quality zipper, and will mount to the floor tom. there is a little pouch on the front and the quality of the material is strong. i keep 5 pairs of sticks and one pair of brushes in it comfortably.
