Open and \\"airy\\". Tracks with ease. Soundstage is very spacious and 3-D. Picks up detail like reverberation even under the most challenging passages. Classical music, especially, sounds effortless. Having said that, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin and Jeff Buckley are also about as convincing as it gets. A Dynavector XX-2 may arguably be a bit more dynamic and \\"Rock and Roll\\" and a Ortofon Cadenza Bronze more dimensional and vivid, but at some three times the dollars, not an option for everyone.<br /><br />Put is this way, even a more expensive phono pre, such as the AVID Pulsus, Lehmann Decade or a step-up like the Ortofon ST80SE are quite justified when using this cartridge. It's really that good. I suppose a good way of describing it is that it \\"gets out of the way\\" of the music. I've had my AT33PTG-II for 18 months now and I am very happy. My only word of caution is that because it's a relatively heavy cartridge, please check that your tonearm is compatible.
