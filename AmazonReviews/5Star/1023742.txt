Absolutely adore this amp! Classic vox tone, not too loud and not too quiet. There isn't a ton of clean headroom but that's okay in my book because I like a little dirt in my clean tone. Takes pedals like a champ and sounds great at any power setting. The amp is also beautiful, classic vox styling and cream tolerate make this as decorative as it is fun.
