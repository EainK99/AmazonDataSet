I love this item.  I'm not an expert piano player by any means. We got this to teach ourselves and kids how to play on it. Im glad that I did. We were looking at getting just a cheap Casio keyboard, but this really adds the look and feel of a real piano to play on.  There are a few things to be aware of though.<br /><br />Shipping:<br />Shipping was great.  No damage to anything. However they will only bring the item to your front door.  They wont bring it inside. You will probably need two people to get it inside. I had a dolly that lays flat.  I was able to get it up on the dolly and it was really easy at that point. I should mention it was just me dragging it into the house.<br /><br />Assembly:<br />Easy to assemble.  All of the holes were pre-drilled for me.  I didn't have any issues. Instructions were very clear and concise on how to put it together.  MAKE SURE YOU LAY IT ON THE BOX, OR BLANKET!!! That's very important.  You will scratch the finish.  Make sure that you have two people to put the legs on when you get to that point. Don't let it rest on the one leg or you will crack it.<br /><br />Device:<br />Very nice. Everything has a full piano feel to it. SD card slot and extras make it nice. I have not had any issues in the 5+ months that I have had it.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Very nice device. I would recommend it highly. I have always wanted to play the piano. I really feel like your are getting the full experience on this.<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone on the fence.
