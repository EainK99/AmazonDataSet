The stock speaker in my Carvin Nomad 1x12&#34; sounded O.K. but somewhat muddy and midrangey. I researched reviews on what others had tried as a replacement and decided on the EMINENCE CANNABISREX.  USA quality was the deciding factor and I was not disapointed at all. Fast shipping right from Amazon, as always. This baby was in my amp and pumping out the tone in no time. Great value!
