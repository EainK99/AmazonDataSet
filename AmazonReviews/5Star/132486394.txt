This tuner works very well. It's small enough to take anywhere but big enough to read and use. The clip sits perfectly on my guitar and doesn't scratch or mark up the guitar at all. The display is easy to read and operate. If you need a tuner this is the one to get. As with any tuner, make sure you know what note the string is supposed to be before you start adjusting it! Just because it is close to a G, doesn't mean its supposed to be G. But anyways, this is a good tuner.
