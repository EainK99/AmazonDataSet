The HitLights A19 Warm White 12W LED Light Bulbs are the best I have ever used!<br /><br />I have purchased a lot of other LED light bulbs trying to find the best and for the most part have always been disappointed in the performance and color of the other bulbs.  The HitLights however have not disappointed in any way.  The color is perfect, mimics an incandescent bulb very well.  Construction of the bulbs looks to be high quality.  The 12W version (I use it for a 60W incandescent replacement) puts out a lot of light and uses way less electricity than a conventional bulb or a compact florescent bulb.  (Side note: I will never by a compact florescent light bulb again.  After having one explode in my sons room and having another one get really hot, smoke and almost catch fire in my daughters room, LED bulbs are the only bulbs I will purchase now.)<br /><br />So far I have purchased about 20 of these and have not had any issues with any of them.  The price point is a little high, but has come down a little from the first ones I purchased and should continue to lower as people switch over to the LED technology.  As long as their usable life lasts as long as they state, they are worth every penny.
