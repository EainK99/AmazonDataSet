If you are reading this, then you may be looking at this item on ebay, wondering if it is worth buying. It worried me seeing some of the negative posts here, but this is my experience. I went ahead and bought it. It was delivered and i set it up. Using the 6 pin bus powered cable is noisy, even with a complete TRS set up. So I used the 4 pin input, powered by the ac adapter, plugged into the 6 pin output from my pci firewire card. It was completely silent. Volume was loud, frequency response was stunning. Prior to using the FA-66 for the first time, I unplugged my Firewire Solo, rebooted, uninstalled the FWsolo driver, rebooted. Installed the new windows 7 64bit driver from Roland. Plugged in the FA-66 which completed the driver install. Rebooted again. Fired up Cubase Artist 7 64bit. Worked great! Sound is loud and full. What an improvement over the FWsolo! Turned it off, then back on, to see if I had to reboot for it to work after powering off. Nope! Fired right up and watched a youtube video. Have to configure windows media player a bit, but if you can't figure that out, your SAT scores were probably low, as well. Why the low scores from others? Lack of expertise. That's it. Midi I/O works great. Latency at about 12ms for me. I have an older core duo q6600 (quad core), 8g ram, graphics card, WD Black HDD. Adjusting buffer from control panel is very simple (too simple). Lots of options. No it is not FW800 compatible. Didn't improve cpu load. Nevertheless, all clicks and pops are gone with this thing.<br /><br />By the way, I am reviewing this as a DAW audio device. I would discourage it for gamers and those looking to use this only for entertainment. Some of the complaints may have to do with someone using this device simply for listening to music or gaming. In that case you may experience clicks, pops and drops, but not in a DAW (Cubase, anyway. Forgot to mention that my MB is a gigabyte)..
