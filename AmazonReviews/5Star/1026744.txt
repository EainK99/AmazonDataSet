For best results, speak 1-4 inches away from mic and change the volume levels to 45% in windows. Also turn off that god awful AGC setting. This mic sounds amazing for what it is. Many people think that I am using a really expensive mic because it is so crystal clear. Highly recommended over the blue snowball. A pop filter and boom arm is a must.
