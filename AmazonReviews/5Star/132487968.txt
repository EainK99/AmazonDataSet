Have had this headphones for 4 years now and they are still working great. no problems with them other than that the ear pads started to get worn down so i bought some new ones, the sound is just amazing in this headphones and i would buy another pair of them when my other ones break down. This headphones can really take a hit, I have been using them weekly for 4 year and I usually just trow them in my backpack without the protective bag around it, and they still work well. the cord is doing well and like i said earlier they are still working like they wear new. The sound quality on this ones are also amazing, if you want anything close to this that i have tried you need to go 2-3 times the price.<br /><br />I use a lot of time traveling around and if i sit in a car or flying i will use them for hours at the time, I can easily wear them for 5-6 hours at the time listening to music, listening to audio books or watching movies, they work great for everything. It don't matter if it is loud music in the car or you are on the plan. The headphone block out most of the sound. At the same time you can play the music as loud as you want to without the guy next to you hearing anything.<br /><br />I would recommend buying this headphones to every one. they are maybe not the most stylish ones, but they are dissent looking and if you care more about the look then the sound than you can spend your money one a lot of other headphones, but this headphones have the best sound in there price range. unless you a looking for a pair $200-300+ you this is the headphones for you.
