Love this tuner.  It doesn't let you cheat and transpose for transposing instruments, however it functions much better than other similarly priced tuners.  Also, for the bump in price, a great value versus their lower-level tuners.  Many subdivisions available and does well with the battery life unless you use the drone a lot (but that's not necessarily a bad thing).  Lost mine last week and had to order another one.
