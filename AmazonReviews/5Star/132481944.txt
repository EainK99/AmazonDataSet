One reads (or hears) about all the things that have been tried over the years to obtain that just-right amount of muting and becomes skeptical of the next &#34;thing&#34; but this thing works GREAT. The simple method of keeping the pillow stationary is effective so once it's placed THAT'S IT.<br /><br />Mutes both heads the right amount.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS THING!
