I purchased this to replace my crane stand, which although very mobile just did not work well for my setup. I am completely satisfied with the Magma. It is sturdy, easy to assemble and is height/width adjustable. My only advice would be to measure what you plan on using it for and where you are placing it.I would also recommend this as a permanent install item for your DAW or DJ setup.
