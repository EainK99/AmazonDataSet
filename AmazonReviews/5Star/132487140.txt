I didn't expect much for the price, I was looking for a starter instrument on the cheap so we could see if my daughter actually liked the viola. It arrived super fast, the accessories and extras were a big plus. Great case. Nothing broken, looks great. Didn't know it had sparkles -- made my daughter even happier! Can't comment on the bow or sound, they are just starting out playing.But even if this only lasts a year it was still cheaper then renting one. If she likes to play, maybe one day we'll be a fancy one but for a kid, this is perfect.
