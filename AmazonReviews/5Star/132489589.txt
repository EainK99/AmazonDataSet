I owned this pedal from 2004-2006 it was awsome then and it still is. I bought this one used from Amazon.com and it was worth the price. The moment I plugged it in it brought back so many memories of jamming with my high school buddies. The effects are great, the sound is great, the built quality is great. One of the best pedals I've ever owned by far.
