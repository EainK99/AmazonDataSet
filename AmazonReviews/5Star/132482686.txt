The box packaging looks different from the picture, but the 5 instruments are the same. I really love the xylophone, which I've been playing to stimulate my baby. Love the crisp sounds, but you've got to strike it right to let each note ring longer. Think I'm enjoying it more than my baby is currently since he is only 6-mth old. Nonetheless, he could play with the rattle, though he'll try to put it into his mouth. The box does say BPA free, and it is made in Israel, so should be safe. Water can seep into the rattle if you wash it under a tap, suggest just wipe for cleaning. The box says it's suitable for 12mth+. I'm sure baby will enjoy them more when he's older!
