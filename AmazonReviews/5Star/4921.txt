I purchased these to wear to all three days of Lollapalooza and they exceeded my expectations! I did not have any problem hearing the music. My ears were not ringing like the usually are after leaving a loud event. While wearing these ear plugs, the background noise/chatter surround me was minimal yet I could still have a conversation with the person next to me. The clear and discrete profile of these ear plugs was important to me when making a purchase decision. The convenient keychain allowed me to store them without any issues.
