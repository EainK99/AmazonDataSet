Great tones even on my cheap single Humbucker SG<br />powerful crunchy sound at high gain levels, works great with low rider skull candies.<br /><br />update: tested with an epiphone les paul custom pro, the sound is great with humbuckers and with the spitcoils its astounding, at first i was not too excited cuz with my cheap sg it sounded just ok but when you have single coils with volume high and the tone/gain down, it gives as much variety as you would hope for in $30 and does not undervalue the instrument you are using.<br /><br />Personally i never get to plug into my amp, i could hardly ask for anything more with the convenience and price to match.
