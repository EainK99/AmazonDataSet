I use these at work, listening to music most of the day (and wearing them much of the time I'm not actually listening to anything).<br /><br />The audio quality is excellent: I've heard new bits of several works (mostly classical, due to my taste in music), and they make me want to get better speakers for my home computer.<br /><br />They are a hair on the tight side, but that appears to be by design (and, I have a rather large head).<br /><br />The two down-sides (which, together, are not quite enough to dropp a star):<br />* they block out a *lot* less ambient noise than I was expecting: I can hear people speaking at normal conversational levels across the room, hear the rattle in the A/C unit, etc.<br />* the cord is coiled, which makes it seem like its in the way more than it really is.
