I bought these because I needed ultra flexible patch cables for a few of my smaller pedalboards. These are perfect! I typically cut and solder my own cables but the material itself is often quite stiff. These are completely flexible in every way and have, so far, been completely silent (which my largest concern when buying inexpensive cables). A great buy and I would happily purchase more.
