Great product. The red exterior looks absolutely amazing and the unit feels sturdy and well built. Drivers and additional software are really simple to find and download, although the Lite version of Ableton 8 is quite limited and you can't do much with it really. The sound quality is pretty good and it's perfect for home use.
