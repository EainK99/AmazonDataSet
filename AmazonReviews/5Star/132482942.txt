If your child is interested in music/drumming, these are fantastic drums. REAL instruments made of the same materials used in professional models. Sturdy enough to take a beating from a toddler, but nice enough to display in your home and be used by the whole family.<br /><br />I consider the REMO Kid's percussion drums to be a great investment and can't wait to add more to our collection.
