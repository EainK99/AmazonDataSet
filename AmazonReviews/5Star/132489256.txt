Taking into consideration, it was going to be my first 27&#34; scale guitar as well as my first 8 string I spent quite a lot of time reading through forums on the internet before I ordered it. When it arrived I was amazed with the quality of build. Believe or not, it looks much better than it looks on the picture. The guitar is hand-crafted in South Korea and feels solid. The body design is just amazing. The stock pickups sound much better than I expected them to sound. It came with a pretty high action, but it took a minute to lower it. You might consider the fact that the neck is quite heavy compared to the body, so use a wide leather strap to avoid neck-diving. I have been using it for a few weeks so far, and haven't noticed any problems with it. I might replace pickups later, but once again, this guitar is a great deal for it's price!
