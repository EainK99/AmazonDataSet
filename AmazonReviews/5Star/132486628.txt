bought this for 9 year old daughter because original mouthpiece losing its cork, and music store service here is painful. Figured cheaper and easier to replace. She's been playing just for a few weeks, and this mouthpiece made an AMAZING difference in sound quality that she is getting from her insturment. Squeaking a little more since it doesn't require as much air movement, but shes adjusting, and when she reduces the air, it sounds BEAUTIFUL!
