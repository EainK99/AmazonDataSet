We bought this mic so my wife could record some online classes. The sound quality is fantastic. It's smooth and rich and makes your recordings sound very professional. The mic is extremely sensitive so we have had to turn the gain way down, so you should have no problem picking up whatever sound you are trying to hear. My wife now uses it for everything, even Skype meetings. The mic itself was larger than I expected and weighs a ton (well, 3 pounds)! We are very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone!
