Great guitar. My kids love to play them (bought 2) and I love to play it, too. Excellent packing-- arrived pristine. Great for travel and casual playing, and since the neck is shorter with less string tension, it makes a great student guitar, too (e.g., easier play but with nice sound). My other Taylor is a 900 CE, and for thousands more and a sound that stirs your very soul, you'd expect me to love it more :) However, these Baby Taylor guitars are a no-brainer for nice sound/playability/fun vs. price. Good value, would purchase again. Put on a fresh set of Elixir light gage strings (12's are my choice, available on Amazon, too-- go figure :) and enjoy.
