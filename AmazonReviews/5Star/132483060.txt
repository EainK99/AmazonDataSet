Bought this to capture voice samples for this voice analysis software I purchased. I needed to be able to get a crisp sample of someones voice for the analysis to be accurate. This did the trick! When I play back you can hear the voice really loud and crisp like. You do have to be aware of things on in the background though, because it will pick it up i have come to realize. I.e. If you have a fan on in the next room over, it will probably pick it up. Also I liked the fact that it goes into the computer via USB instead of jack, so i think that you get a better transfer of sound using USB (this is just my opinion, i could be wrong).
