Pretty amazing sounding cans given the unassuming plastic exterior, right up there with my AKG flagship K812 (except darker/warmer with a narrower soundstage).  The K812 has even greater clarity and detail and maybe sounds more bass-neutral, but the difference is not worth $700-1000 more.<br />I had the HD800 also but returned it because to my ears the 600 was just the better value and better sound, plus it's way more comfortable to wear.<br /><br />The best sub-$500 headphone that sounds like 2, 3x its price.
