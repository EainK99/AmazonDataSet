I've always wanted an Ovation, finally decided to pick one up and I'm not disappointed by the AE148.  It feels great, plays really well and the sound is awesome.  Very happy with the purchase, friends who have played it have all been very impressed, I'd definitely recommend it.  Great guitar for the money!
