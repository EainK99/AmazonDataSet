This is a wise purchase for any guitarist who wants to amplify their acoustic guitar(for guitars without input/output jacks). It feels lightweight and plastic in the hand, despite its artistically painted wood-like pattern. Has soft sides and ridges with formidable foam so that it can fit to any standard acoustic sound hole.
