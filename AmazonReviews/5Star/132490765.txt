If you're even thinking about buying this amp, stop thinking and buy it. This amp covers all the bases for me. Sweet reverb, tremolo, and takes pedals well. Highly recommend Chicago Music, no problem with online order or shipping. I received the amp way sooner than expected in perfect condition. Go get one!
