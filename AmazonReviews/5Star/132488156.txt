Super comfortable and plenty long. I am 5'10&#34; and was concerned because there were comments about this being short. Tis must be for those over 6' that wear their guitars well below their waist line. Quality is very good, and after a couple months the leather has softened nicely on the under-shade side. I bought one for all 4 of my guitars and keep them on all the time. I do not use strap locks but don't feel I have to with this strap. It is thick enough and the holes are tight enough for me to feel secure with it holding my instruments.
