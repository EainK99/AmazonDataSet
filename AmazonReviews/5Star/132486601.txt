\\"This is a very nice soprano ukulele gig bag. The padding will keep my Cordoba 15SM uke very well protected. Gig bag is constructed of high-quality materials - the zippers work easily, too. It is a good looking bag. The other reviews convinced me to purchase it and I am glad that I did. It came packaged nicely and in a timely manner. Very pleased with this product!\\"
