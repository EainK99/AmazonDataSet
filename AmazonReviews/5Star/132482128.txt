I have been without a guitar for many years and decided to finally get one again.  I needed something that is a manageable size since my hands are smaller, and I am smaller.  This guitar is perfect for my needs.  The action is a little high for my liking and can't easily be changed since the bridge IS the pickup.  But otherwise the tone is great and the preamp works nicely.<br /><br />Would buy again, the quality is very high for this range of price.
