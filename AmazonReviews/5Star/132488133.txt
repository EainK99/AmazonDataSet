So the tuner arrived today.  Man, it is <tiny>.  It clipped to my Martin's headstock right above the nut and then can be read easily while it \\"hangs\\" below the neck.  It's easy peasy to use and I found it to be not too sensitive and yet responsive.  I really like the change of colors to let you know you're close.  The sound it yielded was great.<br /><br />The mounting is not quite the day at the beach that clipping a Snark onto a head stock is, but hardly problematic. You push a button and the jaws ratchet open, then you squeeze it shut.  For me, the only thing that makes it less than perfect (and it's not the tuner's fault) is that I use a Hercules 414 stand, and if I leave the tuner clipped it interferes with the headstock contacting the stand's hanging mechanism. So, even assuming it will not damage the finish and could be left on forever, I can't do that if I want to leave my guitar on the stand.  Given that I'm lucky enough to live in coastal California, that is almost always except for when the heater is on.<br /><br />Overall, a keeper and I intend to use it and not my Snark.  I can leave it on the guitar while playing and then take it off when I store the guitar on the stand.  For 12 bucks, a cool piece of miniaturization.
