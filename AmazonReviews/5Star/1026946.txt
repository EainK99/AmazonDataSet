SRS produced the WowThing sound-enhancer, way back when. It was an amazing technological advancement for computer users who only got very poor quality sound out of a pair of small stereo speakers. The device coaxed some great bass and simulated surround-sound from my two wimpy speakers, and I have been lovin' it for years.<br /><br />This new incarnation, a licensed application of the SRS WowThing technology, is a near perfect replacement - as far as I am concerned. It didn't take me long to find the same sweet-spot in my computer's sound system and the remote is a bonus.  As others have stated, you do have to remember that this is only a $20 investment.  For the price, fit and function...I don't think you can find a better sound-enhancement solution for your 'puter.
