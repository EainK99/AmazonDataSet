I ordered this for my son and of course I did it at the last minute so I was a little worried about getting it on time. I did email the company and got a very quick response from a sales rep who was very very nice and helpful. She helped me track the item to make sure of its arrival date. The kit got here on time and was perfect for what my son needed!! I would of course recommend this place to anybody!!!
