The shoulder rest is very secure on the violin, highly adjustable, has folding legs, and what I find to be great is that it actually resonates with the violin. If you play a note or pluck a string, you can feel those vibrations in the shoulder rest just like the rest of the violin's body. This tells me it does not dampen vibrations like plastic ones do. Also, it's very lightweight. I am basically sold on carbon fiber... I think it will be the standard material for production of string instruments in a decade or so.<br /><br />I did have to switch the feet to the opposite sides, though in order for it to position how I like it (low and far back).<br /><br />The downside is that it is pretty pricey for a shoulder rest, and it doesn't shorten enough, so if you have a very short neck, it's probably not for you.
