Yes you may look at these and say yes they look similar to a certain company's Headphones (which i'm not going to say) Lol,but The sound,feel,and color is worth it all. I've enjoyed these headphones ever since i got em,not to mention you pay for what you get. Luckly enough they had a deal lowering the price to about 16 bucks and what a steal it was. All I have to say is don't let someone else opinion stop you from letting you get what you want,take a leap of faith into other products from different company's and at-least try something new. ;P
