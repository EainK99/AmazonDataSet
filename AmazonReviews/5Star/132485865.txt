The manufacturer, Hercules, has discontinued this excellent stand. Why, I can't imagine. Anyone who thinks about the precarious position in which most stands put your valued instrument, will see the virtue in this design. This is stable, making it far less likely that another player brushing carelessly by or your own aberrant lurch might knock your precious baby over.<br /><br />The cost factor has made me resist Hercules stands. I bought another bass clarinet stand some years ago and while it isn't bad, it is nowhere near as stable as this one. Plus I had to do some tailoring on the thing to get the wobble out.<br /><br />You won't have any wobble with this. Hercules' manufacturing is solid - classy - and they use those pop-out buttons to keep all the moving parts in place when in use. Then you have to thumb them in to fold the stand. Easy enough. You get used to the configuration.<br /><br />Yes, it is a bit heavy. And it comes without a carry bag although its cardboard container will work to carry it until it gets too battered. I think a permanent container will suggest itself sooner or later. Actually, this stand is so nice that I might make it a leather bag.<br /><br />Now price. I found that those remaining in stores were generally being sold for about fifty-six dollars shipped. The trick: it will become increasingly difficult to find them. I think that's why the price here is so high.
