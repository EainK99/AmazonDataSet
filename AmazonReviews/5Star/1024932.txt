I spent about four months watching demos and reading reviews of every octave pedal ever imagined. All I wanted was a single clean &#34;octave up&#34; sound but there are surprisingly few pedals that achieve this and even fewer that do it well. Right away in my research the POG started coming up, but I held off at first due to the price. Finally, months later, I broke down and got this one. It's expensive, but the consensus among those in the know is that you can't get a decent version of this sound for much cheaper.<br /><br />The sound I bought it for - kind of a simulated twelve-string effect - works nicely... the tracking is spot on and it never gives me that slightly out-of-tune warble that cheaper octave pedals sometimes do. I keep the Octave Up knob at about halfway so that it subtly shadows the main guitar part - if you put it up all the way where they are equal volumes, it can sound more like a twangy, sitar-type instrument. It sounds even better with distortion on, adding some sparkle to lead parts (or, if you use the Octave Down instead, thickening them up nicely).<br /><br />The &#34;P&#34; in POG stands for polyphonic, and it really is. It sounds just as good on chords as it does on single notes. Used with some ambient delays/reverbs and a volume pedal, you can make awesome swells and organ-like washes of sound that don't resemble a guitar at all. You can also plug a bass into it and run the Octave Up out to a guitar amp to do a Royal Blood-style bass/guitar thing.<br /><br />If you're looking for an octave-up pedal, this (or some other POG) is one of the only serious contenders. (If you need octave-down, there is a lot more available, though not all of them are polyphonic.) Either way, though, there's a reason that POGs are one of the most common pitch shifting pedals you see on professionals' pedal boards. I finally gave up trying to cut corners and just bought the real thing.
