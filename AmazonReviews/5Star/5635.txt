I rarely need more than two pairs of sticks (a pair on standby in case I drop one), a pair of brushes and a pair of mallets. This bag holds those with ease. There is also room for a drum key, small flashlight and other items in the outer pocket.<br /><br />The construction is first rate. I am impressed with the overall stitching, quality of zipper and the layout of the inside pockets. I am positive that this bag will last as long as my Reunion Blues bag.<br /><br />Unlike the Reunion Blues bag this one will not kill resonance when hanging from a floor tom. Part of that is due to the lighter weight, and part to the hooks, which are a major improvement over the rawhide laces on the Reunion Blues bag.<br /><br />Do note that this bag is a hybrid of PVC and leather, and as such will delaminate if left in a hot vehicle (I live in central Florida and that is a major problem in the summer with any synthetic bag or pouch.) For me that is not an issue, but I want to mention it to  be thorough.
