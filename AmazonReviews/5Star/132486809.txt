I bought this PA system to use in bars, wedding receptions, and other misc.as part of a Karaoke/DJ system. The sound is great. Its a bit heavier then I thought it would for a \\"portable\\" system, BUT it has wheels on each end as well as a handle to roll it around.<br /><br />I run 3 mics through it. This is my first sound system so when I first set it up I was using the 1/4\\" inputs. I found that though the sound qhality was not bad I could not get the volume I wanted. This was easy to fix by switching to XLR jacks.<br /><br />I would like to have had a second set of speaker outputs in case I wanted to add another pair of seakers. There is a set of RCA \\"Tape Outlet\\" jacks I guess you could run to an amp with a 1/4\\" adapter if you really needed more. So far this has been enough of a system for what I do though.<br /><br />As for the USB issue I saw in the other comment... I have not used it so I couldn't say. I bought it as a sound system not as an MP3 player...
