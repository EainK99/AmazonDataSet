I LOVE my thunder tube, as do my students!  It is a wonderful attention getter.  It does make a loud thunderous sound but you can easily vary the noise and intensity of it and make it build from a low-rumble to a loud crash.  I use a rainstick before story time and at moments to bring them down a bit and I use my thundertube to get the classes attention...and also as a treat when they've lined up well because they beg for it.  The sounds of scratching and tapping are great for spooky stories too.  Highly recommend.
