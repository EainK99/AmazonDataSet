this is a great case for its price. very light and can only hold a Kun shoulder rest. would recommend for light uses, for heavy travel uses not so much as it is not very durable. the lock is also hard to open, but insert the key turn left all the way until you can't turn anymore, and push the button down! Not in but pull downwards and it should unlock the latch
