This guitar stand functions well for my use.  I don't take advantage of the portability feature, so the folding aspect does not apply for my use.  The pick holder slot is nice but is not secure and picks regularly fall out with normal contact, and I expect someone who regularly moves this around wouldn't care for that. Since I don't move this stand around all the time I haven't had to adjust the support arms and they have worked fine for me - no unexpected collapsing at all.  The rubber coating on the contact surfaces do a good job of preventing scratches on your guitar. In a few months, they have not worn off or peeled away, but someone who moves around a lot and subjects this stand to more activity might have a different experience.<br /><br />Summary: this stand does exactly what I need it to.  I would purchase again if I had the need and I would recommend this to another potential buyer.
