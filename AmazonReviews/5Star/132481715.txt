I just bought this little guy at Best Buy today and so far I'm in love! With a simple instillation of the drivers and a couple of searches on the web, I have it set up and ready to go using Pro Tools 10. With my wavs bunddle and a good sounding guitar, I'm finally able to record some electric guitar on my laptop and I couldn't be more happy! My next step is to get a nice set of studio monitors and a decent vocal mic. For a home studio, this is a good bang for your buck if you're just looking for something small and relatively easy to use as long as you know what you're doing and know the software you're using! But you can find any help you need on the internet and its relatively easy from there!
