I'll start off by saying that I'm neither a professional musician or a pedantic audiophile.  I'm a regular guy looking for a decent quality product that just works like it should and seems like it'll hold up for awhile.  That's what I found in the PianoBox II.<br /><br />I bought a [[ASIN:B0002H0GF0 M-Audio Keystation 61ES 61-Key USB MIDI Keyboard Controller with Semi-Weighted Keys]] for my girlfriend last Christmas.  The keyboard does alright but the reliance on the computer interface has been our only real qualm with it.  Finding very basic software that just lets you play without a lot of nonsense has been nigh impossible.  As a follow-up present, I started hunting for a reasonably priced midi sound module to cut that tie to the computer.<br /><br />I settled on the PianoBox II because it looked like it would do what I needed without a lot of hassle and without costing $500-1000.  I felt like I was taking a risk because there weren't many reviews here but it paid off.  It arrived today and so far I'm completely satisfied!  It has a small footprint, sturdy construction, easily accessible controls on the top, and sound quality that I consider good enough.  It's no Steinway but at least it sounds like a piano.<br /><br />I should also point out that it comes with a midi cable, probably about 5' long.  I didn't see it anywhere in the description and so ordered one separately.  If you buy this, assuming you receive the same package I did, you'll have the PianoBox II, power supply, and a midi cable -- all you need to plug it in and start playing.
