These strings are smoother than mouse p#$$y. Incredible bends, hold pitch and don't break unless you don't take care of your guitar.  Edit: After some time using these strings on different guitars and different styles, I wanted to edit the review. They are even better than I first thought. They stay in tune incredibly well, even after a week not being played. I have not had one break, except tuning up a #8 and I torqued it too much. If you have arthritis as I do, consider these. The #8's have more punch than #10's I've played. You can develop a very light fretting touch with these. My hands don't hurt as much. I started out with 7's but moved up to 8's as my hands improved. May go to 9's. I've sold a couple of other guys on these.
