This pedal is perfect for what I need, a volume increase when I play a solo. If I set it up in my pedal chain from guitar to amp it increases the gain, but if I plug it straight in to the effects loops on my solid state amp it increases the volume which is what I bought it for. Thought I'd give a heads up in case there are other people as clueless about guitar effects and amps as I am. If you ever feel like you need more volume on your leads and solos, buy this thing. At forty bucks it's a steal.
