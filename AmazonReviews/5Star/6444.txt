This case is perfect for my Les Paul II Electric Guitar!  It's the cheapest one I have seen around and it is great quality!!!  I recently used it to fly my guitar to another state during a recent move and while the case itself got kind of damaged (darn luggage transporters), my guitar was unharmed.  I am a satisfied customer!
