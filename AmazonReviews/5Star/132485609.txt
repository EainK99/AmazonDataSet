A lot of people complain about the sounds and quality of Pandora mini; which made me a little reluctant to purchase it, but I have to say it was a great purchase. I'm no musical/guitar expert, nor do I plan on \\"gigging\\" with this device, but for quiet bedroom practice and versatility of being able to tweak different effects and sounds, this is perfect. The \\"hissing\\" sounds that seem common in the reviews on this site, I personally haven't come across it, maybe over time it will turn up, but it's pretty clean sounding when I'm not strumming any strings; certain presets have really loud distortion/feedback with long lasting ringing sounds (which is part of the effect), but other than that, there hasn't been any unwarranted annoying sounds; maybe they got a defective unit. A lot of the presets are neat novelty effects and/or typically lean toward certain music genres, in which case a dozen of them end up sounding the same, but they all sound pretty good... at least with the use of headphones, I haven't hooked it up to a guitar amp or any sort of speaker, but that's not the reason I wanted this. All in all, for less than $100, if you're expecting to replace hundreds to thousands of dollars on guitar effects/gear, that's wishful thinking, but if you're just looking for a cool device that let's you choose different style guitar amplifier sounds and effects conveniently on one device, I'd say look up some online videos for this and other portable Multi effect devices i.e. Line 6 Pocket Pod, and decide for yourself, as for me, it was well worth 90 bucks.
