I can't have a tuner that tunes by sound alone because I have two little girls that NEVER stop talking. So I had to buy one that would tune, despite background noise. This one does a wonderful job! It is small, perfect for my little soprano uke. The tuning is very clear, with little red/yellow/green lines, telling me if I'm well tuned. Fabulously simple.
