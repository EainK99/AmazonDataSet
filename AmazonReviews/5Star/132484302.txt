I bought a slightly used Epiphone SG 310 that came with a deteriorating chip board case.  After reviewing several products, I chose this one and I'm Glad I did.  The SG fits snugly inside a plush padded interior with little wiggle room and the exterior will withstand the knocks and jolts of day to day use.  I even threw it down a flight of concrete stairs to celebrate!  (Please disregard the last sentence.)
