I live broadcast a podcast weekly, and needed a simple mixer, with compressors, without a ton of wires (we travel) that can handle 4 mics and an MP3 player. The Q1202 is perfect, especially for my budget (none). Warm EQ, great compression, very handy low-cut, simple USB input to my broadcasting app. Every channel handles compression and gain independently. I could cut a damn album on this thing.
