I totally agree with the other reviewer of this digital piano.  Her review sealed my decision to make this purchase after I returned a Casio which was poor quality overall with a toyish feel. This digital piano, however, is far from a toy. I am a complete beginner at piano but wanted something as close to a grand piano experience as possible on my budget.<br /><br />I've listened to harpsichord/fortepiano/modern piano sonatas & concerto's for years so I can say that I'm familiar with real piano sound quality. The Harpsichord voicing is the most realistic I've ever heard in a lower priced digital to date and the fact that the pitch is adjustable should make the Harpsichord sound even more accurate.<br /><br />This instrument, especially for the quality and price, is leagues beyond the Casio's and other 'plastic' keyboards around the $1,000.00 range. Keep in mind that the 20 watt sound system won't knock the walls down but is sufficient for home use and there's no LED readout to show settings values. At 0 or very low volume the keys do make a minute thud; I don't consider this a negative. I do wish there was a bit more balance between the loudness of the high and low range of the keyboard with the supplied Grand samples in regards to a softer touch [possibly a velocity curve adjustment would fix? I haven't got that far yet].<br /><br />The key fit/finish/feel/action is superb. The keyboard unit without the stand attached is very heavy suggesting solid construction; no curvature or sag when eyeing/viewing the keys from the side as the Casio [$799] did.  The general structure is high quality and substantial engineered wood and NO cardboard.  The bench quality contains actual real wood legs and a thick plywood seat base with HEAVY attachment bolts. The bench seat padding is quite dense which reduces fatigue.  The keyboard cover slots are lined and it slides beautifully.  The foot pedals appear to be real brass [Rosewood model].  The buttons and controls are high qualityand NOT cheap feeling plus being well laid-out located to the left and right of the keys. The laminate finish quality is great with no sharp or rough edges on the corners of the panels.<br /><br />My tip for any digital piano [a bit of effort and expense required but the result is incredable balanced piano sound and sampling with an adjustable low-end punch]:<br />Hookup to an array of superior PC-based piano sampling.

Although the grand piano samples could be much better, there are other options as I noted above. I recommend this purchase particularly for a beginning student.
