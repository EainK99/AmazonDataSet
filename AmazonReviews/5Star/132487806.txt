Best Buy for the price also the most sensitive and accurate reference Headphone monitors I know of for this price.<br />If you're on a budget you can mix with these without field monitors even!! (although the reason you need field monitors is you can't get accurate low end sound on headphones, you still can get a clue on these) If your into making music that is listened to thru headphones (internet,MP3's) these will help you mix better. They are also good for getting the details on your mixes and blending in effects without it sounding like you using effects. (which is how a pro is suppose to mix)
