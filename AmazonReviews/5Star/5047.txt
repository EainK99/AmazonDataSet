It was a pleasure to do business with the VibeDrum people. They are serious artisans, friendly and chatty. The drum arrived promptly, given a brief wait for tuning which, incidentally, was perfect. The instrument was beautiful to see, lovely to hear, softer, more seductive than the mallet pan, ideal for tender or nostalgic music. Silk singing through a gong.<br /><br />Nothing could have been better done.
