This is one of those rare deals where you get a guitar that's meant for heavy, rugged, professional use and priced for everyone to afford. The build quality is well in tune with what many pro's would like to see. Sturdy, strong, and reliable with less maintenance then most require. Did I mention the looks are second to none? Most guitars this gorgeous aren't built like tanks but this one bridges the gap quite nicely. It stays in tune without the struggle of a Floyd rose tremolo, Proudly resonates a thick bottom end with crisp defined highs, and for the price you will be hard pressed to find better. Easily worth $250 but if you can find it cheaper, then jump on it!
