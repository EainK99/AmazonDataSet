i own both the Millennium AC(this bass) and the BXP non active version. they are both phenomenal in sound and quality. both are tiger eye but i would like to say the AC version has more of a \\"burrled maple\\" look as opposed to the BXP version with a more \\"flamed maple\\" look, both have the same wood tone though and both are stunning.<br /> they both simply play superb and i commend Peavey for the quality control on these. i have been playing guitar/bass for 30 years....never have i played an instrument so user friendly out of the box as the Millennium AC. i have owned $2k instruments and seriously can't say they have anything \\"better\\" then this bass. like i said, i bought this because i liked the BXP so much(converted it to fretless). i play Jazz,rock ,metal and bluegrass....this does it all! its as versatile as a Les Paul. i seriously have no idea how Peavey can offer this at this price.<br /><br />the BXP version would make an excellent first bass which would grow with the student. same bass but non active electronics which is rarely needed by a novice/intermediate student
