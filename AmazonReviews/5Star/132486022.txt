After reading many reviews, I finally decided to purchase this particular guitar for my two children. Unlike what other people experienced, the original strings do tend to stay in tune (the first two strings required only a couple of days to &#34;stabilize&#34;; the other four kept the tune almost since the very beginning). I particularly liked the bright and elegant finish, as well as the sound (certainly not the one of a toy guitar), which exceeded my expectations, specially after reading some very bad reviews. Maybe I was lucky -yes, it's possible-, but I tend to believe that, for the price I paid, the good quality of this product is not exclusive of the guitar I received.
