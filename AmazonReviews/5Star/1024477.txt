I've used a TON of different studio monitors in my life, these are my 2nd favorite at the moment. The sound quality is full and even across the board. No low mid push or High end shelf, they just sound right. I'm using them for Audio & Video post production, and the mixes I'm getting out of these are 100x better than my previous set. I also have a set of MSP 7 at home, but the HS7 sounds better. I don't feel like they've needed a break-in period, they sounded really good right out of the box.
