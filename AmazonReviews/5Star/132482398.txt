I got to know this neck strap design from my teacher and instantly love the look and design. I took the purge and bought it (and shipped to Singapore). My first experience is very good. Being a beginner in this hobby, I noticed that the way I played improved after using this neck strap (my previous neck strap is the one provided inside my sax). I strongly recommend this item to every one!
