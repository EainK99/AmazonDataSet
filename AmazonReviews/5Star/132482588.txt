After a bit of research I ordered the RED Hitlights LED strip to do a few personal projects in my car and studio.  The LED strip came with a female DC terminal attached to one end, and open wires on the other(you would need an AC->DC transformer to plug it into the wall) The strip is simple and conveniently marked with the + and - terminal on every cut-able point along the strip (like the title says, foolproof!)<br /><br />Hitlights provides many a convenient tool for connecting strips, adapters for plugging into car/wall, etc.  However, I decided to bootleg it.  I soldered my own connections + wrapped in heat-shrink, wired up my own car adapter, and the result is awesome.<br /><br />KEEP IN MIND - if you plan to solder your own connections you should use 20 or 22 gauge wire: I was using 16-gauge speaker wire and had to strip it down to about 22 so that the wire would fit on the ends of the LED strip (which is not a particularly safe or correct way of doing things)<br /><br />The LEDs worked great, and are bright - I initially hooked them up to a power supply for testing, and pushed more than 12V through them, and they took much more voltage and got even brighter! (However, I don't think they should be stable for very long with >12V)
