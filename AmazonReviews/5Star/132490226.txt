I purchase these legs fo my Yamaha dgx 505.  I could not find the exact legs for the unit, but these legs work very well and support the piano comfortably.  The stand does not allow the legs to be screwed into the pre-drilled holes, but the keyboard sits on the stand and allows me to move it with little effort when I play engagements away from home.
