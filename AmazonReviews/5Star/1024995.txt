I have no idea why anyone said this sub sounded anything but amazing.  It was clear, articulate, punchy and low...my only complaint might be that the volume didn't hit 130db, but it is less than $300 and it sounds as good as anything I have heard even twice the price.  (I have been a DJ for almost 20 years and have experience with JBL, QSC, Carvin, Peavey, Behringer, Crown, American Audio as well as many other speakers from different manufacturers, and anyone who thinks Bose is worth buying isn't worth reading a review from)  After reading the previous reviews, I was really hesitant on ordering this product but upon receiving it, wonder why I haven't used it sooner...Great product all around!
