Works fabulously.  Provides great illumination for my Optivisor.<br /><br />Pros:<br />(a) Mounts very effectively to the Optivisor, and doesn't get in the way.<br />(b) Hits a reasonable price point (sub-$20 is great).<br />(c) Provides great illumination from several LEDs (enables you to see inside any depressions or holes that the item you're examining might have).<br /><br />Cons:<br />(a)The on-off slide switch has \\"off\\" as up and \\"on\\" as down.  Most people would expect the other orientation.<br />(b) Although there are 6 LEDs, they are each a \\"point\\" light source and can cause a little bit of glare when examining some types of items at some angles (fortunately, just turning or slightly re-orienting the item you're examining fixes this).  However, there is no way to fix this issue without greatly increasing the cost of the product (you'd need diffusers and brighter LEDs).
