I bought this system as a replacement for a much older Schure unit.  This one is much more advanced than I was aware of until recently when I needed to purchase a lavalier system for my use (I am the priest).  This unit gets less use, but is very easy to set up and use.  It took, literally, 5 minutes to connect this to the sound board and start using it.
