This us very cool! I got it because someone had it at their cabin in Northern Wisconsin.  It has red and green lights that you can adjust how the move. When it is pointed into trees in your yard, it looks amazing. I am not sure if I would leave them out in the rain, but am so happy with how they work and look. Many of my friends have looked unto purchasing.
