Great quality for the price. Granted, I am not an audiophile, but I do listen to a lot of music. Also, given that I have hearing issues in both ears, it is very difficult for me to find headphones that are both comfortable ( I also use them to watch TV ) and have very good sound. I just got them, took them out of the box, plugged them into my cell phone, cranked up the tunes and went...&#34;Wow&#34;. Very happy.
