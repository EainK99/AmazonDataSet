This is an arrangement for beginner/intermediate piano players, but the melody itself is basic Americana and so the arrangement is perfect. I love this tune, and wanted to be able to play it for myself at home, and for friends when a piano is available. If you like Ashokan Farewell as much as I do, and have any ability at all at the piano, this is for you.
