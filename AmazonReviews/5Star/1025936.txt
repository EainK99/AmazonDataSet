Great strings, sound very nice, last like a string should and resist breakage better than others. I use the Lights, 11's. I play the guitar hard at times- I break normal strings (Diadario, Martin, etc..). I do wish they would make a heavier wound E (52 for this set) - the 54 E works better with drop tunings, I have a 54 E connection, dude breaks a lot of strings and plays Earthwood 12's, plenty wound 54 E's in his gig bag...- I've tried many others but swear by these Earthwoods strings. I put Slinky 10's on my Strat and LP as well.
