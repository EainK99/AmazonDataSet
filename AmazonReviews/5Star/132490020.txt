Well, for most home recording, this is the gold standard! Of course unless, you have a semi-professional or professional studio at home, then you may have to buy a mic of 10x the price. But for the commoners, this mic does justice to its price and works for a variety of situations. Mic-ing the guitar, or voice, speech, podcast, recording multiple people, omni-directional... it just works!!
