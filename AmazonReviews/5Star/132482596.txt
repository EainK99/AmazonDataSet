I've had this device for one year.  I have recorded about 20 live shows at various venues with great success.  This recorder does a fantastic job for live music.  Battery life is amazing.  Added bonus is the shape and size of the H2n.  When I need to get into a venue that has no recording, I leave my cell phone in the car and act like the Zoom H2n is my phone. I hold it in my hand with my keys while security wands me and off I go!
