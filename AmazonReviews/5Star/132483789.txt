I got this with free shipping so it was very worth it.<br />The strings are individually packed in plastic bags and the rest will not rust when I opened just one to use.<br />Unlike Ernie ball, I used only 1 string and the rest rusted in the paper jackets once opened.<br />The sound is very acceptable :).<br />I would buy these again.
