Excellent stand, very lightweight, only 2 pounds!  Sturdy, cool blue color.  Rubber grips.  I have a large keyboard RD-700 and it will fit and also a smaller 61 key VR-09.  The VR-09 is slim and needs stabilization due to the width of the stand on top.  I'm going to add more rubber to stabilize.  Very easy to carry with one hand-light!<br />Update:  I needed a 2nd tier added for my other keyboard.  I bought the Proline PL400T and it works well.  I added a section of non-skid pipe insulation tube where the keyboard sits so the lighter keyboard won't slide. The rubber ends come off easily from the structure stand, I recommend a little glue to hold them on so you don't lose one at the gig. Very happy with the aluminum stand and how easy it is to carry and strong!
