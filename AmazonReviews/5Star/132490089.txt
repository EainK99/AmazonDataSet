I wasn't expecting that this would be such a big unit--but that's not a bad thing. It puts out really nice sound and has a tough exterior. The only thing that I could have potentially brought down the rating is the fact that the speaker pole mount is the screw in type and not a simple hole like most subs. This wasn't clearly evident in the description, but it's my own fault for not looking closely. I bought the wrong pole at first, but it wasn't a problem to replace that one with the correct one. Just something to look out for if you're thinking about buying.
