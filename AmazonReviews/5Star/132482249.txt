This review is for the Laguna LE122 guitar only.<br /><br />I have never played guitar so thought my review may be perfect for this guitar since it's designed and sold as a beginner set. I bought it from Guitar Center a couple days ago and received (what I felt was) a great value price. The one I purchased is a brand new guitar (not used), however it's the guitar only and didn't include the extras regularly sold with this beginner set.  My local store had evidently given away the accessories and was left with only the guitar. This was sold to me at a greatly discounted price. This was perfect since I really only went shopping to buy a guitar to learn on.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is my first guitar and I bought it to learn. This means I can neither review nor comment much on the sound quality or play-ability since I have no idea how to play at this time.<br /><br />This review is mostly based on the workmanship and value of the guitar only, minus the included accessories. I truly have a beginner's point of view.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Medium to med-high quality materials used in construction.<br />2) Beautiful gloss-black finish on body.<br />3) Solid feel and weight.<br />4) Double Humbucker style pickups are of higher than expected quality/sound.<br />5) Overall high-quality 'feel', for a beginner/learning guitar.<br />6) 'Rich' look...appears as much higher quality/brand<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Simplistic (ie. just the basic necessities).<br />2) Strings close together...the other reviewer posted this as a pro for beginners but personally I just have trouble with it.<br />3) Pricey...though I received a discounted price on my own guitar and happy with that, I think $250 is a bit too high for a GC exclusive brand.<br /><br />Basically you are getting $50 or so worth of accessories, meaning the actual guitar cost is about $200+/-. For that price I would probably buy something with higher resale value.<br /><br />The last thing I will add here is a comparison.<br /><br />The only other experience I have withe buying a nwe guitar is a Fender Squire 'Bullet' which I purchased earlier this year for my daughter to learn with.<br /><br />This Laguna LE122 is of higher quality build than the Fender (which is a similar style/make). The Squier, while pperfect for my 13 year-old daughter weighing 90lbs soaking wet, is a very light bodied guitar that both feels and looks rather cheap compared to the Laguna. Though I'm betting the Fender Squier Bullet will likely hold it's resale value better than the LE122...however I may be wrong.<br /><br />As an adult buying my first electric guitar to learn with, I'm happier with the Laguna than I would be with the Fender being compared. However, my opinion on this may not be the same had this Laguna guitar set me back the full $350 or $250 (price of optional sets)...or if I had even paid $150, for that matter.<br /><br />The truth is (at least my version of the truth ), for a beginner guitar to learn on, just buy what's not going to set the bankroll back too much because chances are you'll just buy some thing better later on anyway, if you decide that playing guitar is something you will stick with.<br /><br />Either that or go high and buy something with great resale so you can recoup the investment should guitar playing turn out bust.<br /><br />Sadly, This Laguna LE122 falls short of eother side of the line. It appears to have low resale value and also costs a bit too much (IMO) to chunk down on a beginner model. May be wworth the cost as another guitar to add to a player's already growing arsenal...but I'll need more time and experience in this new hobby in order to write that review.
