Have used many kinds of speaker wire.  None wound or woven to reduce mutual inductance.  Was using two separate runs of 12 ga. two-conductor for each speaker - each lead paralleled to make a single 10 ga. per lead - .  Worked well.  I was skeptical but this cable gets more information to the speaker.  Piano is better.  Multiple instruments have their individual detail/colors - especially strings and drum.  I'm using a 10 and a 20 ft. run in stereo with Marantz pre-amp section, Crown LSX - 1500, and Tekton large Pendragon speakers.  Same improvements appear with LSA-2 and HSU HC1-Mk2 speakers.  And the banana connectors on this cable are first rate.
