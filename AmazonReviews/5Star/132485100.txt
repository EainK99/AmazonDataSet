Not only was the guitar pristine but the seller was amazing! I was disappointed when it arrived because the cord was not in the box. I contacted the seller and they shipped out a quality cord at no addition cost! Packaging was definitely an A+. My daughters first bass guitar and this one is perfect for the new player or young ones!
