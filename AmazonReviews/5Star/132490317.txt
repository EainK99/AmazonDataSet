Honestly, I was skeptical when I got this. I wanted to get a plastic reed to have as a back up for the eventuality that I broke all of my good reeds. However, this reed is very good sounding. It's pretty well made and easy to play. I really love it and enjoy playing with it. (I'm a student bassoon player, by the way, so I don'y know if it is perfectly on the whole time)
