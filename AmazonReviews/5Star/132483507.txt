This amp head is amazing! It is really a Bogner quality with a natural Bonger sound playing out of it! I change all of the tubes and then I find that the volume is totally enough for almost every places (of course not big gym). What's more, if you got a high-output pickup, you will not need a boost in front of your amp anymore, switch on the Bunch bottom, you will get a really appropriate high-gain with the warm of tubes. So in general, it is a affordable amp with surprised sound!
