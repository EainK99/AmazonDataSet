these are just what i wanted.  THey sound great and are not too loud.  I use mallets to play them instead of my hands.  I made my own custom set of drums which these fit right into.  The tunable feature is very nice as you can make them sound any way tyou wnat to!<br /><br />I'm an adult and to play these small bongos with adult hands might be awkward, but as I mentioned before, I play them with mallets and they're perfect for what i want to do with them.
