You will not be disappointed if you were looking for a pick that is easy to grab and do not affects the color of the attack when you hit the strings.<br /><br />I play jazz guitar and I telle you with these picks you can really go fast.<br /><br />Don't dream about it, with out 4-6 hours of practice a day any picks are useless!!
