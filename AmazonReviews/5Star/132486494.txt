This is my  &#34;go-to&#34; guitar. It can handle all type of music. I find myself taking my rainsong more often to gigs than my Martin, Gibsons & Taylor. In fact, I've since sold 2 of my high end guitars because they weren't being used at all after I purchased this guitar. Surprisingly enough, it was not a tough decision.<br /><br />I highly recommend this guitar. The sound is beautifully warm and very distinct. I always get complimented after each performance about the sound. I would compare the tone to a well seasoned guitar that have &#34;opened up&#34;.  As a plus... The guitar is impervious to weather. No more worrying about humidity, rain, heat, cold etc!<br /><br />I can go on and on about my Rainsong but bottom line... I love it, and its the  most versatile full body acoustic guitar out there. Bar None!
