I bought one of these to control a HitLights Cool White Double Density 600 LEDs Flexible Light Strip that I purchased and installed in my small travel trailer for lighting. It works great. It takes a minute to get used to how to control the brightness, but once you do, it works as advertised.<br /><br />I followed the advice of another reviewer and soldered a wire to the backside of the touchpad and extended it over to the bed in my travel trailer. This way I can control the lights by the door when I walk in, or when I'm going to bed. I wouldn't recommend doing this if you're not experienced soldering.
