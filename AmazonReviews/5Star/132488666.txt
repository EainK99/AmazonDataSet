I was a little wary about buying this ocarina at first (an Alto C for less than 60-70 bucks usually means cheap quality), but I'd heard good reviews on Focalink and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did; this ocarina is absolutely wonderful. The sound is pure and sweet, and the high notes are easy to hit (there is some airiness, but proper breathing technique and/or the acute bend gets rid of the majority. What's left gives it expression rather than detracting from the song). Volume-wise, I'd say it's medium: not too loud and not too soft. It's very high-quality and could easily go for double what is listed; I actually compared this ocarina to my friend's more expensive Songbird Ocarinas, and the quality was nearly identical. Ergnomics-wise, it seems to be very comfortable for people with small (me) to large hands, so it should work well for most everyone.<br /><br />I highly recommend this ocarina both to beginners and more advanced players alike. For beginners, it's both easy to play while giving great sound quality. More advanced players will enjoy it as a rather balanced, versatile ocarina. Either way, it's a steal at this price (45 dollars when I bought it).
