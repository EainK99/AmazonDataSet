If you own a vintage cymbal stand or one of the modern ones that are lightweight this will fit. For modern stands with the 8mm threads I recommend the [[ASIN:B0002F4M2K Cymbal Crown Quick Release Cymbal Holder 8 mm]] model.<br /><br />Key advantages to this holder include the elimination of the whole top felt and wingnut assembly, and sleeves. More importantly (to me) is there is no need for top or bottom felts. I have never used a top felt on any stand because they kill the natural resonance of a cymbal, but this also frees me of the bottom felt.  The soft cup that supports the cymbal does a better job than a felt and cuts down on decay. Since I started using these I have noticed a discernible difference in my cymbals, including over and undertones that I had not heard when conventionally mounted.<br /><br />The material is sturdy and the crown itself is easy to install and use. I had no problems directly screwing this onto my vintage stand - the threads mated perfectly and it is solidly in place. To mount your cymbal all you need to do is squeeze the post tines and slide the cymbal onto them, release and the cymbal is mounted and free floating. To remove the cymbal, squeeze the post and lift it clear. Simple and no extra moving parts.<br /><br />For me this and the companion model for my modern stands are perfect. They truly hasten set-up and tear down and there are no parts to lose.
