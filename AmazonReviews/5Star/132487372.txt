I was impressed when these arrived.  The cable itself is fairly rugged (as a microphone cable should be) with a nice outer surface to help prevent kinks and tangles.  The transition point from cable to termination is well done with plenty of thicker &#34;stress relief&#34; collar so it won't get bent at a 90 degree angle or torque on the plug.  The termination is well made and feels solid.  The locking mechanism is very secure and has a definite &#34;click&#34; when inserted correctly, which I find reassuring.  I would recommend these cables for anyone looking for high quality, durable cables at a reasonable price.
