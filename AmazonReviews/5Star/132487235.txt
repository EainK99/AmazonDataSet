I purchased these to use in the Church Nursery. I took them to Church today and brought them out to use while we sang. They loved this addition to music time. These are very well made. It will be fun to add a new dimension to the music-toddlers need to have as many new things placed around them to see their interests and just how they will grow. Thank you to Amazon & Hohner.
