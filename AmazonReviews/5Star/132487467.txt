I pondered buying one for a long time.  I bought it so I could learn to play with picks without bothering my neighbors.  This mute is fantastic.  There is virtually no work or time involved in setting it up. You just slide it under your strings and thats all you do.  I had concerns that it would sound bad, or shorten the sustain time.  If anything, it may have increased the sustain.  It sounds good.  If I had any complaint at all about it it would be that it makes my banjo sound a little like a spanish guitar.  The sound is soft, which could vary on the model of banjo and strings. I definitely recommend this.
