This looks like a modern cauldron ,limericks included.Stir with tipper and play lullabye to your babies.Forget major and minor for awhile and tip your tipper.These ittie-bittie sweeties require a delicate hand.A thick 18 inch skin family member drum needs the day lights out, beaten method.A nice duet in the offen.Parent and child drums.
