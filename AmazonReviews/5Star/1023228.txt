This is well worth $25 and then some. I like that it has a decent amount of padding. I got this as a gift to go along with a guitar I'm giving a new beginner and I like it better than the onstage I got for my own guitar. I may need to purchase another. A nice feature not really talked about is there are small pouches inside the case too. These are good spots for small items such as extra picks or small tools. There was no pick but I've heard the picks provided by this company aren't very functional, they're huge! You can pick up a pack of picks for as little as $2 and get much more use out of them. I hope this is helpful and happy playing!
