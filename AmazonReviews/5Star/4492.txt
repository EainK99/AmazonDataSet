It's worth every penny. Extremely versatile. The only caveat is that it does not do plan clean sounds well. It can do clean but it just doesn't have a good bell like crystal clean, like you would get on a lionheart or blackheart (from crate). Even the Ironheart range has better cleans. But cleans are available here, you just have to do a lot of tweaking. Try tone at 3 on the bridge, it seems to work well at the lower drive settings.<br /><br />But for anything beyond plain clean it shines like a burning star.<br /><br />Now, this is a $600 amp, and it's closest cousin would be the Ironheart 30 watt 112 combo at $700. It is very difficult to say which one you would want to buy as the IRT30-112 is only a bit more expensive. But I would say, that either is a very good choice. Do research into both to make sure you are getting what you want. I wouldn't want to buy both because they overlap in many areas. It would be a very difficult decision if you had to decide between those two amps!
