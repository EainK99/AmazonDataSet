To preface this short review, I wanted to let you all know I'm a musician (Clarinet player). I've been using this microphone mostly to record rehearsals for my dress rehearsals for my Senior Music Education recital.<br /><br />I've used it in practice rooms and a large recital hall and I've got to say, the sound quality is fantastic!<br /><br />I have needed to bump up the gain to about 6 on it to get recordings of a good volume, but the quality has absolutely stunned me. I haven't heard it distort yet, which was a problem with every phone or tablet I used before for simple recordings.<br /><br />It captures a very large range of frequencies very clearly and evenly, and accurately captures subtle timbral differences between different instruments.<br /><br />I do need to mention that it isn't particularly easy to use for non tech-savvy people. Thankfully, it's simple enough for when you just want to record. You pull the switch on the right side down to turn it on and just press the big red record button up front.<br /><br />I haven't played with the other features of it yet, or changed the recording mode (Switch up top).<br /><br />I am still absolutely stunned at the sound quality of this microphone though. Easily worth the investment for every musician.
