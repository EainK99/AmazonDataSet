Those hard cases are awkward and heavy. This solves both of those problems easily. Our 14 year-old daughter LOVES it. It's a joy to carry, and it's much more solid than it looks. It's been dropped and kicked, but her alto sax remains perfect. Also comes with shoulder straps, that was a nice surprise. Definitely worth the money.
