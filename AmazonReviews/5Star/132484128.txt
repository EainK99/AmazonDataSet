I created a complete conga/bongo monster kit that is all together in as one instrument and it just recently fell and damaged one of the older bongs. I have been looking to make the same creation, but that can be taken apart as the earlier version was held together with 35 bungee cords. With the new conga and the stand from a pair, I used 2 of these Gibraltar SC-BDCM Bongo Mount to hold two different bongos so I can have a new version of my old kit, just minus 1 bongo set. It works well and are the best on the market due to what you can do with these. You are NOT limited to movement or placement like some that are fixed into a specific spot without height adjustment or maneuverability. If you need to put a bongo somewhere and want it to be adjusted anywhere till you found the sweet spot, I highly recommend these. I put both tighteners on same sides instead of how they come for my advantage.
