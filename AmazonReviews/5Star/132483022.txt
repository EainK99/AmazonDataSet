I have over 22 drum kits, many of which I 'restored' myself, and I have these in EVERY bass drum (most kits are double kick).  They sound freakin' awesome!  I'm a studio and live player (full time), and when I play with these in the studio and with guys that are not part of my regular band, they freak out at how good my kick drum sounds (my band just takes the sound for granted now).<br /><br />BUT VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST mount the foam properly in the plastic ring so it will stay in place.  Make those little tabs in the plastic ring STAND UP ALL THE WAY, then mount the foam on the ring, then put the ring and foam on the bass drum, then mount and tune your head.  IF YOU DON'T you run the risk of the foam moving around and possibly falling down within the bass drum.  DON'T JUST MOUNT IT ON YOUR KICK WITHOUT PROPERLY ADJUSTING THOSE TABS.  They don't come out of the package sticking up enough to hold the foam properly (usually).  Believe me, I have over 40 of these things.  AND if you have a heavy foot like me, and you go through heads, this beats the Evans EQ heads because with these you can swap the head (and use any head you like) and REUSE the Remo Muff'l (making it far cheaper than constantly paying more for an Evans EQ head every time).
