Now my Korg SV-1 is on a stand as sexy as the keyboard itself.  Before, I was using an old X-stand that I'd had for years, but it always looked like a temporary setup.  With this stand, the SV-1 looks like a great piece of furniture.  I have it on display in my living room and I get compliments from guests all the time.  I would highly recommend this stand.  Worth the extra bucks.
