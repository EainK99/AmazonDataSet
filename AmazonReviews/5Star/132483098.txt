Years ago I made the switch to Nova (the Vic Firth rebrand for visually blemished factory-rejected sticks). I used 5A for a while and eventually switched to 7A for the lighter weight and increased speed. Both were nylon tipped. These sticks were $2-4 per pair (the price has risen over the past 10 years), which makes them dirt cheap and great for a guy who tears through sticks. However recently I decided to compare stick life and feel to some more expensive counterparts to see if it made sense to switch. It was then that I order a couple pairs of these sticks (along with several others).<br /><br />Quick background: I've been playing for 13 years. I play everything from Jazz to Hard Rock, usually settling on something in the middle. I play in the studio, at home, at a large church (read &#34;full dynamic range&#34;), and in a band.<br /><br />My Analysis: These are heavier than either the Nova 5A or 7A sticks, but the feel is superb. They still sound fairly bright, though not as much as a good 7AN. They're fast without feeling weak like a light stick does when you want a strong rimshot. And best of all, they beat my previous stick purchases in cost versus lifespan ratio. Novas were getting me between 1 and 1.5 hours per stick. These are fairly eratic, but I'm still getting 4-10 hours based on playing application. If my numbers seem high or low to you, adjust them for your playing style, but know that they last at least four times longer than cheap sticks, and they're only twice the price. I highly recommend these sticks!
