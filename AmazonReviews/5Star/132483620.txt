If you are looking for an affordable, loud, crunchy, Marshall solid state amp, then look no further. Just the default setting stored in the 4 channels are all that I would ever want. For a 15 watt amp, this thing rocks!!! If you mike it into a PA, then it would be that much better! I have found that this thing sounds the best without any effects pedals going in. This is not a clean, Fender amp. If you love classic rock or metal and that great Marshall tone, then this will be the best 150 bucks you ever spent!!! A+++++++++
