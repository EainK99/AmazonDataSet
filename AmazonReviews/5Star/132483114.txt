I am the type of person that never reads manuels and will play with electronics until I learn how to use them. And I have to say this is an extremely simple machine. Easy to get around. I use to have one years back that was way more complicated and cost about $150. Unfourtinately (like most people in this economy) I have to bargain shop, cause I'm not made of money. This was one of the cheaper interfaces I found but I could not be happier with it. I love that it will accept a normal and computer microphone, very nifty. I run this with FL Studio 10 Producer  and am able to plug my head phones into the interface as well. If you're looking for cheap and sturdy, you found it.
