I don't usually write product review. but damn these are really great strings. I own a Jasmine by Takamine, a cutaway acoustic and this is my first time changing it myself and for the past 5 years, all my strings that I have used are pretty good but this, this brand lives up the expectations that i have gotten from other reviews. The strings are nice and smooth (like how others described), and it is perfect for my guitar. the sound that it produced its awesome. Great great product. keep it up Elixir! you just got one new loyal customer today! I highly recommend it!
