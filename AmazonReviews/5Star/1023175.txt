We Purchased this piano as a transition for our small church.  It was a definite step up from our previous unweighted Casio keyboard.  The sound is good and as suggested in a YouTube video, I often combine the first two sounds.  I agree that the organ sound is terrible but who really uses that?  For the price it is a nice digital piano that of course is not a real piano and you shouldn't expect it to be.  We use it through our sound system so we are able to adjust the outgoing sound some.  We would definitely recommend it to others.<br /><br />Right now we transport each week to our venue.  It fits into my trunk and I am able to carry it into the building with no problem.  When we get a permanent place, we will buy a better piano and use this as backup or in the youth room.  In the meantime, this digital piano does a great job.
