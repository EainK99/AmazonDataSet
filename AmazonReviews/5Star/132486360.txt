Strap is great. It is made out of hemp, so its a little on the heavy side. The leather was soft enough to pop on my Tele and jam right away, but not too soft as to slip off. The strap is pretty long, and will adjust to just about any player's height. Highly recommended. And it is the coolest strap I've ever seen.
