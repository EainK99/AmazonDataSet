This is one of the coolest toys! The amp is built in to the bottom and the kids had a great time singing! There is also a plug for a MP3 player so you can play music through the speaker and they can sing into the microphone at the same time! Really awesome product and great gift idea for that little Paw Patrol fan! You can really hear the sound and there is a control button so you can control how loud they sing and the music plays from the MP3 player! Love this toy! One of the best things I have bought on here!
