I was looking for a inexpensive guitar like less than a $100 that I could learn on and it would sound good to me and to others, so that when I played it people wouldnt be like \\" dafuq is wrong with that guitar please stop that racket!\\" It actually sounds great I got it in just two days and the strings that come with it are nice. The blue color is perfect and there are no defects at all. It's very comfortable to hold and it sounds as good as a thicker guitar. If your worried that you might make a purchase you'll regret then buy this guitar its awesome
