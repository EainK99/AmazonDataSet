I used these as replacements for the stock tubes in a Bugera 1990 amp head<br />When adjusting the bias 2 tubes were within 1mA of the other 2 so I would say they are very well matched.<br />The sound is noticeably fuller, warmer and well balanced with a more depth than the Bugera tubes (which had more mids and treble - harsher)<br /><br />I would purchase more of these in the future
