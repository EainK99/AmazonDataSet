This keyboard is exactly what I needed. I am relearning the piano/keyboard, and this was a great choice. It came in great shape, and arrived in good time. &#34;Donn K&#34; shipped it to me quickly, which put a smile on my face. It has been a few days, and I have already played several Christmas songs... I was hoping to do so with my family this Christmas. This will really keep me on my toes, while providing hours of great entertainment. I have purchased several additional music books. Can you tell I'm happy?
