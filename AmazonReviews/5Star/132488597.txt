Purchased for the purpose of recording a VOX Tonelab SE (the big one with two pedals) on my computer - works great.  Really cool to have the ability to record without anything more than a $30 cable (the tonelab I got for $200 on the internet).  I've heard of people using this for the output from a mixer, which I imagine would be great for making live recordings.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with the product and would order again if it was lost or stolen.
