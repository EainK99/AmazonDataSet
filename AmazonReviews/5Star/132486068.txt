Really I've always wanted a V15 but this little cartridge performs . It's Smooth and full sounding, excellent separation and frequency response. I haven't tried the 1812 digital cannon tracking test yet , (the V15 was one of the only Cartridges that would track that).<br />But @ the moment this is the best that Shure offers and it's priced right for my budget. Keep up the good work Shure.
