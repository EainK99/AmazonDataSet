I first saw this at the beach and knew my husband had to have one.  Since then it has been on many adventures with us - tailgating, beach, concerts, nascar races.  I agree with a previous reviewer it's not for severe terrain, but you can drag it up and down the beach with no more issues than a slightly full cooler.  The sound is not Bose quality, but it's pretty good for the non-audiophile.<br /><br />Bluetooth range - I think it's pretty good for bluetooth - probably 15-20 ft?  More than my phone could do bluetooth with my earphone.<br /><br />Sadly, a couple months after I bought mine I saw one with a disco ball on top - I really want that one but can't justify getting another one just becuase it has the cool disco ball. Just as well, my husband has used it at work a few times, and that might be a bit much.
