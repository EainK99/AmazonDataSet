I purchased this foam to place in my window and various places around my home recording studio. I was very surprised at how well this foam worked. I mean, I use to have to wait for the birds to stop chirping before I could begin recording, now with the foam, I can record even when the neighborhood dogs are barking. The window no longer rattles when trains go by. I can't imagine anything working better than that. So, I say, this foam did it's job.
