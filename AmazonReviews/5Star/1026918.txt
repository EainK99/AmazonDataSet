I'm on a limited budget, and my nice PC setup, synthesizers, and studio monitors are on a plastic folding table as my desk.  I'm sure you could imagine that this is not the acoustically optimum configuration.  Even a moderate volume on my 8\\" Event 20/20BAS monitors would start everything on the desk buzzing.  These pads have mostly eliminated that.  Also, the way they bring the tweeters up to the level of my ears makes a very noticeable difference in stereo imaging.  I've used these in the past on a desk that had two shelves up and to the sides of where the computer monitor goes, and this design lets you remove or rotate the foam wedge to adjust from flat level to two different downward angles (or, I suppose upward, if you flipped them around).  Could you find a piece of foam and cut out your own?  Probably.  Would it be the right firmness to support a heavy set of monitors while still absorbing as much vibration as these do?  Probably not.
