I've been using Rotosound bass strings since 1976, I love the tone, nothing else sounds or records like these. We do rock music so take that into consideration. These strings are very very bright sounding, they cut through a rock band in a great way and have amazing sustain.<br /><br />I always liked the sound Chris Squire from YES got, he used Rotosound bass strings.<br /><br />They only stay bright and great sounding for about six weeks, then they go into a deader kind of tone that is useable but not my favorite. When we're recording I love a fresh brand new set of these on the bass.<br /><br />Amazon has great prices on Rotosound bass strings. I use the four string version of these on my 51 P Bass, same gauges except without the low B string.<br /><br />These are great.<br /><br />Good luck and good music to all.
