I can't comment on how this works for other than voice overs, but for that it is really a great mic. It is very warm. So warm that things like applying low contour are definitely going over board. I get comments from time to time that my bottom end seems over boosted. My EQ is flat and I am doing nothing else - it is this mic. If you are trying for a mellow sound, you can't do much better than this. Is is a little low in gain, but I have no issue with it. I have had mine over three years now so I don't consider it fragile at all. I don't travel with it, but it is out in my studio 24/7 and does get knocked around a little from time to time. Until I can afford another digit in the pricing, this is my mic of choice.
