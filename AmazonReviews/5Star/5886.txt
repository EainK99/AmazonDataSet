Got one a year ago for my music stand .Still working like new . Got another one arrived today for my keyboard at my desk  . Free standing  without  needing to use the clip  No batteries included but  came with the  usb cable  and  works wonderful so don't need to put batteries in this one . They take three A A batteries  . . . not A A A  as some have suggested . Regular or re-chargeable the batteries last real good  if you are going to use it with batteries .
