One of the best set of XLR cables that I have used.  i love the fact that they are not stiff, but are of great quality feel and sound.  I wished I had purchased the 50ft set, because I seem to be running out of room on the road most times.  But when I get a chance i will be purchasing the 50ft or 100ft set.  Keep those wonderful colors coming.  P.S., you guys can have a sale now and then too.
