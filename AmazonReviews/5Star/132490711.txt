A have a couple/few different range guitars, and most have been shipped ups etc. This is by far best shipped, double boxed and wrapped inside gig bag to boot.  E string was popped to be expected any guitar shipped with strings on, no big deal, otherwise immaculate.  Once opened I was impressed for the price... The schecter name is not forgotten on this, unlike some other names out there with china cousins, upon inspection of this I look at how it's made above where it was.  It's made well, very well, nothing I can say loose or chipped or inherently cheap on it.<br />  Keeping in mind the price, I'd say it s way above board.<br />All Gunmetal chrome is nice touch, but if your an upgrader you'll need to know about that, no obvious part changes required.<br />3x3 tuners are not Grover's but look and feel like they are.<br />Fretwork is nice, edges nice, board is nice, 24 fret layout with nice tribal inlay at 12, kinda stands out.<br />Maple neck no \\"skunk stripe\\" which I personally favor, does have a bit of grit feel, a quick 00 steel wool rub over made it silk. I'd call med-jumbo fret, though may be considered jumbo, like the neck a lot, feels just right to me, what the specs are for just right are hard to get...<br />Nice countour body, much like omen-6, sunk in controls, standard tune-0-matic bridge with a string thru even the ferrules are gunmetal chrome. I don't know that the Felton kinda staggered string-thru thing really does anything but it looks cool, my experience is the intonation matters most at the bridge which, though this is nothing that special, no graphite etc.  gets job done well as its all good design with 3x3 tuners and fixed bridge inherently made to keep in tune, which matters most.  Think the body is either basswood or paulownia whatever it ain't plywood, it's really nice weight maybe 4lb range, say 7ish overall,  nice routed countours arch and even the back neck joint like kinda ESP ish.  In black finish just as deep and glossy as anything out there.  Nice build quality,<br />  Nothing on this feels cheap, I haven't dug all into it to say if there's full size pots etc. I doubt it but things are in good order here.  Pickups are high output decent ceramic, there's upgrade opportunity but not really needfull type.<br />To be picky for some out there, maybe some Duncan's and tone pro bridge about all I can say, but the $? If your after the best get the best.  But this is  definitely good I wouldn't write all this...<br />  If your looking as gift or a starter, etc, this is one that can last a while, get upgraded easily and last some more.  I would not be ashamed to play this on stage it can hang with big boys.
