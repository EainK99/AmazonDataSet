I work in &#34;Small&#34; so I need good products that work in the &#34;small&#34; so to speak. I work with puppets, so everything is smaller than life. My Roxant Pro Mini LED fit the bill perfectly. It is small enough to work in the media, but still big enough to give all the light I need. This is my first product for Roxant but it will not be the last. I played with it and it was a joy to see what a small strobe could do. Thank you so much Roxant and also Amazon for having what we need and get to us when we need them.
