I love the Xylophone! It is IN TUNE!! As musician and music teacher I believe having an in tune instrument is extremely important because a child learns to hear pitches by listening to the music he/she is surrounded with. So many &#34;kid&#34; instruments are horribly out of tune, thus teaching the child to hear pitches incorrectly. This one is perfectly in tune. Even the overtones on the octave notes (C to C) match up!<br /><br />The song book was easy to read and I'm thinking of getting another so that we can play the songs and duets together. I appreciate that the letters for the notes are given for those who learn best by reading and the colored blocks are given for those who learn through patterns.<br /><br />In addition, it arrived quickly, it is sturdy and well made, and the Xylophone has a rich, full tone. Much better than I would have expected in a smaller sized instrument. I look forward to many years of using it with both my family and students!
