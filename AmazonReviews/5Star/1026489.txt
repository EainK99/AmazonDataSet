I bought this for my guitars with Kahler tremolos and I am impressed.  I was doubtful at first but all of the tuning quirks on my Kahler disappeared- stretched strings came back in tune, tremolo dives and pulls also came back spot on.  It certainly beats soldering the ball end on every set before you put it on or having to use sheaths on the end of the strings.  Great tone also.  My only question now is how long they will stay fresh.  I usually use Elixir strings because they keep that new string sound for longer, but even if the D'addario strings don't last as long they take the fuss out of stringing my guitars.
