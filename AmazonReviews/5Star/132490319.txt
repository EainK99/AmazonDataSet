I love my Shure earbuds but the only earpieces that I like are the yellow foam ones.  They don't move around in my ear and they do a pretty good job of passively canceling ambient noise.  But they get dirty.  I lived with the dirty look until I couldn't stand it anymore, then tried all of the other tips that came with the earbuds.  None worked for me.  These are great replacements, from Shure, and work exactly like the originals!  I'm back using my 'buds and set for several years!  They came quickly and exactly as advertised.
