If you work with many sites with professional or high end &#34;prosumer&#34; audio gear, you will need this adapter at some time! Audio-Technica and other audio manufacturers have many mic bases which use the extra two pins for control, but map the 5 pin XLR to the 3 pin XLR for audio only. This adapter saved me purchasing or making an expensive or time consuming adapter cable.
