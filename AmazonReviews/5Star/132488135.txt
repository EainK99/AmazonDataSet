used to replace 3 preamp tubes(red label Fenders(groove tubes?) on Fender Hot Rod Deville when thought 2nd tube was bad. figured i change all with slightly lower gain 12AX7, which is what my research found these to be(not 100% sure but general consensus). Although they didn't fix my problem, they do sound very good. Now have more umph, balls, fatness, not necessarily more power though. i was worried new 12AX7 would be too much, add brightness, but did not, worked as expected. i like a good jangley  without being too bright of a clean sound and a gritty crunchy bluesy overdrive but with some clarity, not too warm a bluesy sound. if that makes sense to you, sorry not a better description, that's what i like and these tubes got me there.
