For in this price range this keyboard is probably one of the best you can get. Its plug-and-play compatibility is great and you can custom make your own hotkeys. I'm using it with Logic Pro. I'm also an intermediate piano player but I compose more then I play. The value for this keyboard is well worth it the hammer action keys or semi weighted keys feel good and I'm used to an upright piano
