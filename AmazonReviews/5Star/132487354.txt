This is a First Act Discovery instrument meant to be an inexpensive real working ukulele that allows you to start learning. After buying one to test, I actually bought a few more to give as gifts and have kept one for myself. Although this line is generally aimed toward young children, this is a standard size soprano ukulele, although a little shallow. Yes, it is made of plastic, but it has real ukulele strings that may not be high quality, but they are not fishing line as others have stated. Although they do not have the volume or tone of a wooden ukulele, they are excellent for learning on and have a unique tone that I enjoy. Because they are a plastic mass produced item they are much more consistent in their construction than the cheap wood ukulele's. They have good quality real tuning machines, but like any other ukulele, they can take a good week of tuning every day to get the strings stretched before they hold tune. These are the same as the Disney line of First Act mini guitars which are really ukuleles since they have four strings. I'd recommend this to anyone, including someone who wants to learn to play as well as seasoned players that want to experience a different sound.
