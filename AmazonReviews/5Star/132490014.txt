I installed these strings on a friends 1950 &#34;Harmony&#34; uke she had as a young girl.<br />It's amazing how much better the uke sounded once these strings were installed.<br />I have no idea of the brand strings that were in the uke, but once changed out with the Aquila Nylgut strings, the sound was really good.....even on the old instrument.
