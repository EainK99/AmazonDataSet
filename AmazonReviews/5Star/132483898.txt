I am a member of the largest amateur ukulele group in the U.S. (Dallas Ukulele Headquarters [DUH]) and almost all of us use the Snark. It is reliable, quick and accurate.  Some people have broken the stem which holds the dial, but I have carried them in very rough circumstances for several years and never broken one.  They are inexpensive so I have 3 of them which I carry in various gig bags to make sure I always have one available with a good battery.
