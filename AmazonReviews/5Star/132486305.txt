While I could have chosen the major competitor's stand for less this one looks better and is exactly what I needed. It is well built and matches my red leather chair and red upholstered guitar stool decor rather than one that looks like it belongs in an orchestra pit. No extra rubber feet to purchase. No music sheet clips to add (these clips are for music sheets and not music books because they would need to be stretched and then the sheets would not hold).  Very good hardware in all, and the legs will go pretty much flat if desired. Nice size lip with enough width and depth to hold my monster books, and a few extra books to boot. The attached mike clips are a great addition (I use one to hang my red headphones, and the other for a handheld mic). The fit, finish, colour, and assembly are very nice indeed. The picture does not do this stand justice (note: the desk portion in the photo appears almost transparent . . . it is in fact the same colour as the stand minus a few typical silver rivets as most stands have in order to attach to the stand).<br /><br />This stand looks good from all directions, and has received many compliments from friends, my wife, and my mother-in-law. For me . . . it just works, and I would buy it again from Amazon who delivered ahead of schedule.
