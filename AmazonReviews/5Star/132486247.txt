I am a guitar beginner and have used this guitar for a month. I ordered mine from American Musical Supply via Amazon. The first guitar I received was a dud and only worked on the treble setting. To their credit, American Musical replaced the defective guitar quickly and at no extra cost.<br /><br />The second guitar works perfectly and holds its tune unlike the previous guitar. This Epiphone Les Paul is a work of art. A black finish wraps a sleek body and elegant gold hardware pops from the guitar. This guitar's style reminds me of a grand piano.<br /><br />My new guitar not only looks good, but sports excellent performance. Here is a list of reasons I love my Epiphone:<br /><br />- Holds its tuning for days<br />- Pro Buckers produce a rich sound<br />- The coil split feature augments sound variety<br />- Neck is glued in and not bolted (personal preference)<br />- Glossy finish is easy to clean<br /><br />Possible Cons:<br /><br />- The gold plating on certain parts may wear off with time<br />- The guitar is heavier and thicker than cheaper guitars such as the [[ASIN:B0047YUM9O Les Paul Junior]], [[ASIN:B0002CZUV0 Special II]], etc.<br />- It's Chinese so quality control is an issue (buy with a good return policy)<br /><br />Hopefully this review clarified your buying decision. If you buy this guitar, I suggest getting an [[ASIN:B0002D01K4 Epiphone Les Paul case]].<br /><br />UPDATE July 26, 2014:<br />I've had this guitar for almost a year now. Tune still holds. The gold plating is holding up better than expected. Rocksmith 2014 and this guitar make a great pair. Nothing to complain about!
