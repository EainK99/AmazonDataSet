[[VIDEOID:moADM13GN9C8CY]]Hi all-- this product is fairly straight forward! A few other things to note-- the cover is pretty basic. It's not as tightly stretched as the company's stock photo shows. My mixer is only a three channel mixer so fairly slim. I was able to tighten the cover with the bungee which helps keep it in place. The material is a very soft lycra material- no padding involved. If you need something to simply keep dust at bay? This will do the trick.
