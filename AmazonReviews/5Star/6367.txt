I fell in love with this thing as soon as I started using it. I needed a cheap audio interface that could handle some drum mics that I purchased. DID THE JOB BEAUTIFULLY! Once you get it hooked up and learn how to use it, it's simple and does exactly what it's supposed to. The only thing that some will have a problem with is you need to install third party drivers. But they're easy to find and they work just fine. I have no complaints with this product.
