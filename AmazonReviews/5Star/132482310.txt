This was my first time buying a violin and all I can say is wow! This violin is so awesome! It's sounds so good when played acoustic and even better when I use an amp! I play for my church and it just sounds so beautiful! I have no regrets with this Barcus Berry Black piano violin!!! Love Love Love!!
