Fast shipping, pretty durable, perfect for my budget, and my seven year old son on his birthday (he wants to be Link when he grows up. Lol. He's so awesome!).<br />It comes with a pretty cool little song book. Its easy to read, teaches the basics, and a couple of easy songs including the very cool Star Wars theme.<br />The cool thing about it is that is is easy enough that my son was able to use it to practice by himself once I showed him how simple it is to read the notes. We are not a musical family so there's no sheet music or anything like that. Basically just pictures showing which holes to cover for every note. Very simple.<br />My seven year old loves it, hasn't broken it, and picked it up pretty quickly. It's really easy once you get the hang of it. He wants to dress as Link, playing real songs from the Ocarina of Time when we go to his first Comic Con in 2014. We are pretty excited :)
