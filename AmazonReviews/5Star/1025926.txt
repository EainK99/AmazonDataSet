Well it seem's I can not express my true feeling's about how the... Pyle-Pro PMKS5 Compact Base Black Microphone Stand ....that UPS delivered yesterday..... LOL LOL LOL so I will try this again.....<br /><br />I ordered the .... Pyle-Pro PMKS5 Compact Base Black Microphone Stand ...and as far as the stand goes it seems ok ....But UPS the people that delivered it get's a ZERO ((0)) on this item...... Seems the package went through where Audy Murphey went to and back, and passes through a terrible...TERRIBLE storm... It is a miracle and I do mean literally a MIRACLE that it got here in one peace and nothing was missing.....the Shipping box was tore all to peaces and the box inside the shipping box was tore up pretty bad, had it not been for the strong plastic wrap the the base was in the mic holder would not have made it...<br /><br />I can not find a phone # to let Amazon know this.....<br /><br />Billy .....8-12-2015
