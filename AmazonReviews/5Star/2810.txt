I was initially disappointed with this product.  The battery cover would not click in to place, the arms drooped, for lack of a better word.  The seller contacted me by email after the purchase to see how I liked his product..and I gave him my honest opinion, that I thought it was a piece of junk, not even worth the time and effort to send back, as it was relatively inexpensive.  Well, not only did he arrange to have a replacement shipped to me at no charge, he also refunded the original purchase.  The second light works exactly as I had hoped after reading all the great reviews.  Awesome customer service!!!
