I could not be happier. It's the only soft case which will take my jumbo Takamine acoustic 12-string. I was expecting to have pay much more for such a case. This one also has multiple pockets of differing sizes. I can comfortably fit all of my peripheral items in. I'm ready to roll for some busking. You'll find me on the Embarcadero down around the Ferry Building in SF. Traveling to and fro on the BART should be a breeze.
