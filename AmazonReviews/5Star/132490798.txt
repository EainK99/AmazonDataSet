I received the case four days after ordering. I bought it for my newly purchased Oscar Schmidt OD312CE 12-string. Great fit. It's a very sturdy case; the only flaw: the soft bottom lining is not secured (glued) to the side for a six-inch stretch.  It's a very easy fix and doesn't detract from the overall funtionality of this case.  I highly recommend it and for the price, it's a steal.
