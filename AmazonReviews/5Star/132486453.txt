I've never owned any DiMarzio pickups before, but I'm glad I do now. I've always bought Seymour Duncan's, and while they make super pickups, I haven't heard anything from them that matches these, including their STK-4 which is a very similar design, a stacked humbucker with a bottom coil doesn't add much to the tone, but cuts the hum at least in half or more, leaving you with a nice single coil sound and response.  But I gotta say I think the area series from DiMarzio has them beat, at least to my hands and ears.<br /><br />The DiMarzios are dead quite yet have all the sparkle and punch of a true single coil, while bringing forth a beautiful rich sustained tone.  They truly are magic.  This set is ideal as well with the area 61, 67, and 58 models in the bridge, middle and neck positions.  Wiring was easy, although I would have preferred a little bigger wire gauge.  I bought the antique white and they look nice against the new tortoise shell pick-guard I bought.<br /><br />I will add that they all have the same pole spacing, like Fender pickups,  whereas Seymour Duncans often have narrower spacing at the neck.  While it is marginally better for tone, it is a pain to find replacement covers.  Some can't be replaced at all. This is another reason I abandoned SD.
