When I saw that this stand needed to be assembled, i was a little concerned - I'm not good at assembling!  But it was very easy, and everything fit together perfectly.  This stand is sturdy and solid.  I like the styling, so instead of tucking it in a corner, I have it out in clear view.  I'm really happy with it, and the price is quite reasonable.
