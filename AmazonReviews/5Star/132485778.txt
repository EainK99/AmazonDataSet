I changed my guitar strings for the first time and decided I wanted to use these. It took me an hour to string it all up, when I got to the high E string, I guess I pulled a bit hard on it, it snapped in half an hit me in the face. Its a shame I complete string set but these strings have lasted me about a year up until now and it's still going strong!
