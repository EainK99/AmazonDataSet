When I Received this item I was worry for the small size. I love black color and plastic material seems to be fine. When I connect to my cell phone the sound was very bad. I was very worried...and sad...but in a minutes the sound gets better, and I connect it to other devices like my laptop, sd card, and USB ...the sound is really good, very good 100 watts RMS and sound is so loud I cant get the maximun volume..my ears gets hurt... I have a garden, and it sounds so loud, clear bass...good treble.... I think is fine for a party!!! may be this item is a china product, but for now is working well....small size but good sound...I need to test the microphone issue, but for this momment is a good purchase for me. The user manual is fair, only tho pages, could be better. The back panel control seems little fragile, but is ok... Im from Costa Rica. ***Update april 2016: The unit works well but I have somo issues with the bluetooth, seems not fuction well. There are problems with connectivity.
