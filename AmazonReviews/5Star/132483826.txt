I bought these because they are the strings that came on my Taylor GS-Mini when I bought it.  I bought the guitar because it fit nicely in my left hand and because I really loved the sound of the guitar.  I don't like to fiddle with things too much so I'm sticking with the brand and gauge of strings that caught my ear in the first place
