I did a lot of research on which rosin to get for my daughter. She's been playing violin now for 10 years and though she's still only in a 3/4 size instrument, she is in the local youth symphony and performing in competitions and needs a good quality rosin. The Andrea got good reviews on other sites not only for rosin quality but for the design of the item.<br /><br />My daughter has dropped so many rosin cakes, I don't even know any more. Most of the time it was because it would come unattached from the cloth. Also, with touching the cloth it would pick up oils and the rosin would get a film that made it difficult to use. Not this one. The case is sturdy and my daughter likes that the rosin isn't wrapped in a cloth. She says this way when she rosins her bow the cloth doesn't wipe it off as she uses the rosin.<br /><br />It produces a good sound and you know immediately when you're needing rosin. Great quality!
