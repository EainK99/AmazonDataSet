I've been playing bass for about 17 years. These are unquestionably the finest bass strings I've played, for my tastes.<br /><br />If you're never played flatwound bass strings before (they aren't very common today), and are unsure about spending so much money on these, you could try starting with a set of D'Addario Chromes to get the general idea - fuller, more consistent tone than roundwound strings, less finger noise, great for recording. (Maybe not superb for slapping.) But the Thomastiks sound better than the Chromes, and feel better on the fingers than the Chromes.<br /><br />I may use some other strings on occasion for specific purposes, but I expect the Thomastik flatwound strings to be my primary bass strings for as long as I can get them.<br /><br />Also available in 5-string and 6-string sets.
