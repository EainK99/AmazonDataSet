I purchased this guitar on sale for my fiancee, and wow, were we surprised. It compares with guitars easily in the $450-500 range. Here's what we liked:<br /><br />- Fit & finish; very good, flamed maple with pink tint looks pretty nice, no scratches, no weird spots in the finish, everything tight<br />- Setup: very playable; needs a small truss rod adjustment for my tastes, and maybe bring the bridge down a tiny tiny bit (my fiancee disagrees, she won't let me touch it)<br />- The inlays and overall look of the guitar is nice<br />- The sound is both bright and mellow; not a lot of volume or bass, but that's what you get with this body size (parlor) acoustic<br />- Electronics: great; sound very good, and the built-in tuner is quite handy and easy to use.<br /><br />I've steered clear of Luna for years, and if it weren't for trying one of their acoustics out in a local store, I wouldn't have given this guitar a second look, either. Definitely worth your time, and quite possibly your money. I recommend giving Luna a try, especially their mid-higher end instruments.
