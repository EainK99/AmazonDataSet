When I had my first guitar I bought Fender strings because I was playing a Fender guitar. After a while I sold that guitar I bought a Special guitar and I loved the sound I got from it using EXP strings that were on it when I bought it. I sold that guitar, and, I wish that I never did! But I used the money from that to buy<br />a Taylor 714ce. That is the finest guitar I have ever owned. It also came with EXP strings, medium coated just as I liked. I will keep this guitar till the day I die.
