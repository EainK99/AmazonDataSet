I have had this guitar mistaken for a Fender Squire when it gets the first glance. Of course, when they actually look they do notice that it is not a Fender. But, it sure feels like a Fender, sounds like a Fender.. I can not say smell like one, haven't smelled a brand new off the shelves one yet ;). It was shipped with a lot of care, it did come with the cord and instructions in case you are new to where things go. The color is magnificent, and this is a very heavy guitar, nothing lightweight or cheaply done with this guitar. No, I am not that great and awesometastical with playing the guitar yet, but I do know a good guitar. Probably is the best for beginners to get since it is in the lower price range.
