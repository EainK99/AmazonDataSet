Real easy to run, you don,t loose your highs. You don,t really need to mess with the micro switches. The blend knob gives you just enough compression. Just a little clip if you want. And it doesn't use much petal board space. Also, works great as a clean boost. True bypass, and doesn't, break the bank. What more could you ask...Hello
