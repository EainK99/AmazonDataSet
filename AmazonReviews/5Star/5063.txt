I have tried rico. I have tried the local music store reeds. Never again will I touch either. I love these reeds. They're wonderful. They are more expensive then other reed brands, and honestly here you pay for what you get. The sound quality is better and while you are playing it's just generally nicer. I have been using these reeds since 5th grade when I had no idea what I was doing with a instrument taller then me. I recommend these to everyone, I even convinced my friend who was a die hard rico user to try these and she hasn't gone back.
