I've been using Roto's for years. I just recently went up to 11's and like them just fine. They deliver a bright aggressive tone. I occasionally throw on some really gritty distortion and these strings really sing with that. The only knock is when they're first put on, they feel a little raw. Like they could have been polished a little smoother. But, that quickly resolves itself after a few plays. Maybe it's just residual from a finishing process but, I could see it being a little annoying if you break a string mid-performance and have put on a new one of these. Sound-wise, they are bright but, settle down after some play. The fatter strings do a great job holding tuning with some moderate tremelo bar use. A good set of strings.
