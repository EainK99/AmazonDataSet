Got this so my daughter wouldn't leave her half-size cello sitting around between practice sessions.  I didn't want to spend a whole lot, because I have no idea if she'll still be playing the cello six months down the road.  The stand works great -- keeps the cello out of the way, off the sofa, safe from the pets.  And it's small and relatively lightweight, easy to move from one place to another.  It works just as well as the much-more-expensive stand I have for my own cello.  My daughter often pops the cello, still in the soft case, into the stand, as soon as she brings it home from school, which keeps it safe and safely out of the way.  Well worth the money.
