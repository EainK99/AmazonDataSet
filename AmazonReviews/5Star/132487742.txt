My niece specifically asked for a pink guitar for her 6th birthday.  I was so happy to find this one.  It is a little big for her right now, but she will easily grow into it and enjoy for many years.  The case was better than expected and also came with picks and a pitch whistle.  I was very, very happy with this.
