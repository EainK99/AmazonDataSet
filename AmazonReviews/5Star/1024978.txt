A very good, low price, low-noise pedal, great dynamic and response, it works perfectly with my Roland Handsonic HPD10 (but being simply a trigger I guess it can be used with most of the sound modules available in the market). I use a mono cable instead of the stereo jack in the box, but works fine as well. The issue with the neighbours downstairs is definively solved!
