I've played electric guitar over 35 years, and I'm a gigging guitarist in a band. I've used many types of picks over this time, but I've settled on these and here is why:<br />1.  They don't break.  I've never had one break on me - but I've certainly broken other types of picks.  The nylon material used on these is very tough.<br />2.  They have molded in texture, this keeps the pick from slipping - either moving in your grip, or worse, dropping it.  I don't think I've ever dropped one of these, but I know I've dropped other types.  I always keep a spare pick handy in case I drop my pick - but I've never used the backup with these picks.  This is the most important attribute of these picks for me.<br />3.  They print the thickness of the pick.  So if you have several thicknesses, you can definitively tell which thickness you like - and avoid buying the wrong thickness.  I think they are color coded too - but I would rely on the printed thickness.  It does not wear off, by the way<br />4.  Price is good.<br />It is true some have some flash around the edges, it varies lot to lot.  I don't find this a problem.  The strings will rub this off tip in no time.  If the rest bothers you, it can be quickly removed with a bit of sandpaper, or rubbing it against a wound string, or even on your jeans.  I have not found the flash to be a significant issue, however.<br />These dunlop picks have been my choice for over ten years now, and I won't go back to a smooth surface pick - they just don't provide the grip I need.<br />Ordering more today.  (I do still lose them, however!  No fix for that yet.)  As for which thickness - that's a personal preference, and will vary based on guitar, strings, and style of play. These (.73mm) are slightly more flexible than most mediums, but are stiffer than most \\"thin\\" picks for certain.
