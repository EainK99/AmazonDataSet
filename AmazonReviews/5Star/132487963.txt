If you have a Fender Deluxe Reverb and you've changed the stock 6V6 power tubes to 6L6s, this will be a big improvement over your GZ34 rectifier tube.<br /><br />It'll put a little more headroom in your Vibrolux Reverb as well.<br /><br />Whatever you do, DO NOT put one of these in a Princeton Reverb - bad news - the Princeton can't handle it...!
