This is a perfectly acceptable replacement stylus for several audio technica cartridges i had for spares..,It fits perfect and sounds great.I had to mount it as A tempoary replacement cartridge and needle on my VPI scoutmaster table. I had an unfortunate  accident with my regular high end cartridge and needle I mounted this as a tempoary  replacement.I was really suprised how decent this combo sounded.
