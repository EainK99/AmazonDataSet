I was having a lot of trouble finding a decent gig bag that would fit a 12&#34; open back banjo. This bag's not absolutely perfect, but especially with a padded strap like this one: [[ASIN:B0043WF916 Neotech 8223562 Slimline Strap, Banjo, Regular, Brown Leather]]<br />it fits really well. (Not sure how that link will get formatted.)<br /><br />Like others have noted, the front pockets are kind of awkward. They'll fit books if you're ok with the books popping out the top. Overall though, great bag. Enough padding for putting in a car, trunk, throwing on your back and biking around town.
