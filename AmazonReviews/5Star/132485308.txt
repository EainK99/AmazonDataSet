My friend bought these a while ago, and after much research & consideration, I decided these were the headphones I'd purchase as well. I ended up getting a really good deal on mine (wasn't in dire need of them so I waited for one to come across), and that makes them all the more worthwhile to me.<br /><br />Starting with cons (always the easiest part, though not many to be had!):<br />- Somewhat bulky, not as stylish as some other headphones. If you're buying headphones to look cool in public, feel free to spend a ton more on Beats or V-Modas while also sacrificing audio quality.<br />- Cable not detachable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Build quality. These look & feel excellent. Cups rotate 180 degrees, flip up for more compact storage/transportation, and the band is<br />- Audio quality. I feel like I can finally listen to music without needing an equalizer! Rich, 'punchy' bass, excellent mids and highs. This, however, is subjective & relative. Relatively, these are the best bang per buck in terms of audio performance. Subjectively, that can change if you have specific preferences, in which case you shouldn't buy these.<br />- Comfort. The cups are soft and supple, with depth that prevents the driver guard from pressing on your ear. They do get warm after a while (as do all closed headphones), but all you have to do is swing them forward for a bit.<br />- Minimal leakage. you can have your headphones to a decently loud volume and not bother someone nearby. Cranking up to ear-shattering volume? Yes, you'll bother other people. If you want zero leakage, consider in-ear options.<br />- Sensitivity. Just about anything can drive these headphones to ideal volume levels. A DAC/Amplifier might be a good investment still if you have to crank your audio up to more than 70% for your ideal volume; devices tend to start distorting at high volume output levels.<br /><br />All in all, these are a great buy! If you're patient, head over to Slickdeals (or check Amazon regularly) and wait for them to go on sale ($100 isn't uncommon - keep an eye on both straight and coiled cord versions!). If not, they're still a good buy at their regular price.
