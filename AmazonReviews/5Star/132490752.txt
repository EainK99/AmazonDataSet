This was a replacement case for my daughter's 4/4 violin.  Her old case was literally falling apart, and this one does the job quite nicely.  The only negative thing I can say is that the original case had soft velvet straps to hold in the violin, and this one has plain velcro straps, which of course are not soft, and potentially could scratch the finish on the neck.  I solved that issue by taking a piece of the old case liner and wrapping the neck of the violin before it gets strapped in.  As long as my daughter remembers to do that...<br /><br />I do highly recommend this item.
