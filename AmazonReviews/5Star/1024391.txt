Worked like a charm - I actually purchased this because of the reviews - specifically to examine the soldering and layout as I plan to do some of my own for a few other old axes that sound like crap (or don't sound at all). Worked like a charm. I coupled this with 2 single coil Seymour Duncan pickups - it's easy, solder the positive leads to each corresponding solder tab on the 3 way switch and solder the outer braiding to the backs of the tone pots. These two changes (wiring harness & pickups) turned a marginal Dean Vendetta into a fun to play blues monster. Definitely better parts and soldering then what was taken out of the Dean.
