I started djing with this wego. After watching a lot of internet curses, most of them uses some heave dj brands like Denon or more professional Dj equipment.<br />The Price of this product is awesome!<br />The LOOKS! 10 stars!<br />I use it with Virtual Dj LE wich is included and you can do a lot of beginners mixing.<br /><br />- After a time of using the Wego I can tell that it is missing this:<br />1) Knob for channel gains<br />2) Virtual dj Le should be a little less restrictive (I know they push you to upgrade)<br /><br />- Pros:<br />1) Looks<br />2) Performance<br />3) P R I C E !!<br /><br />If you are a beginner Dj, and you are looking if you are into the dj stuff, BUY IT!
