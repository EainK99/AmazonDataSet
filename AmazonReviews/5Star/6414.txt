I've been wanting to get this pedal for some time now and I finally got it. It produces such great and accurate sounds. I have it hooked up to my Line 6 Spider III 15w amp (upgraded to 20w) and a Rogue LX200B bass. I also have a Grunge distortion pedal which I don't really need when I attempt to jam to Metalli-Cliff songs.
