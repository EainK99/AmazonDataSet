Hi everyone, I would like to remomend this guitar pod to every person who doesn`t have an amp and/or fx.<br />I had my guitar only and after giving it while I decide to get one of these tan buying an amp, I play alot at home so I just plug it in to my home theatre and it rocks!!!<br />Amp simulation are extremeley good, and there`s no enviroment wich a can`t connect to, it`s very versátil, and it`s construction is strong as concrete.<br /><br />Don`t think it twice, all what you`ll read on line 6`s web page is completeley true.<br />I whent over my expectation by far.<br /><br />Regards!!!
