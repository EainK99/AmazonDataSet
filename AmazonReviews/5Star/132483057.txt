This is the first multi effects pedal that I played in stereo or two amps with a y adapter that sounds better than when you play it through headphones and the led screens and 32bit technology make it sound like Im playing various tube amps with realism and it is at a great price too!The instructions are also available in english if you buy the US version the adapter is for US wall outlets,ps check out the YouTube demonstrations and you will be a believer too!!!
