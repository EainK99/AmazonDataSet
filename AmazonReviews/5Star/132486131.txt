I have a number of huge native trees on my property which seem to weather attack by natural pests and elements, but we recently had a 25 foot Serviceberry tree planted in our front yard as a specimen, and leaf miners seem to love it.  I had a landscaper spray it once which seems to slow the miners down for a while, but it cost me $35 and they seem to be coming back after about a month.  The tree is somewhat too high for me to reach with conventional sprayer, so I purchased this Hudson Trombone Sprayer to do the job myself.  It turned out to be just right.  It will probably reach 30 to 35 feet with no real trouble, and is simple to deal with.  It has a suction hose that will pull whatever you want to spray up out of a small container, so you can mix up a pint or less of insecticide or plant food for a single job and not have the problem of storing or disposing of the overage you might need to work a tank sprayer.  Also, the trombone is a cinch to clean, just drop the suction hose into a pail of water and pump it a few times to clean it out, and you're good to go.  I'd recommend this sprayer to anyone.
