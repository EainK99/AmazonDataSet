This is the first time i've used lapel microphone but it was pretty easy to use. The i Pro Max Lavalier Lapel Microphone is light weight and small. the cable wire is thick and durable and long enough to hand off to someone else.Plugs right into your device headphone jack.  Apple I phone , I pad.Great sound quality. Usually when i'm talking to someone they are hearing muffled sounds and always telling me to speak up,but since iv'e been using the microphone I don't get that instead they ask did you get a new phone?comes with a carrying case and a extra microphone and clip.Great for Video's, Podcast,Business men or women, recording speeches and for teachers for their lesson plans.I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.
