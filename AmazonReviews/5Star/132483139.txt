...with a few caveats.<br /><br />I bought this unit in hopes of using it to bring VSTs into a live setting without having to haul around a bunch of extra equipment, re-do my entire rig, or spend an arm and a leg.  After a little tinkering, it's working GREAT!<br /><br />I first attempted to test-fit the FTP on several of my guitars and found that installing it on something with a tremolo (especially a Floyd Rose) would be challenging due to either string height or the space between the tremolo and bridge pickup.  Luckily, I was able to squeeze it onto my PRS SE CU24 Navarro by moving the bridge pickup ever so slightly towards the neck.<br /><br />After the hardware was installed, I spent the better part of a day downloading, burning, and installing software.  Once everything was installed (and updated!), I discovered that, although there are some rather nice-sounding patches included, my old laptop wasn't quite up to the task of running many of the FTP sounds (or GuitarRig) without noise or latency. That being said, it works beautifully with my copy of SonicSynth2.  Latency is virtually non-existent and the tracking is superb. Time for a new laptop, I suppose.<br /><br />Overall, as long as you've got a powerful enough computer (or want to run it in hardware mode to control other VSTs), the FTP is a spectacular tool for expanding your sonic palette.
