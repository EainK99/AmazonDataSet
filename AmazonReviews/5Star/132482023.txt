I am delighted with my new Fender guitar..just a wonderful instrument. Sounds beautiful and clean, and no more having to find my tuner because this guitar has a time saving built in one. I have very short fingers yet this one I can play easily. Low action and lightweight, not bulky to hold, yet full sounding and rings out pretty!  It was delivered within three days of my order which was crazy, but true. The only thing that was not as the picture showed, the guitar is a bit darker than the picture.  No problem as it sounds so pretty. Best guitar I have bought yet..awesomely priced. Don\\"t buy used, this is the one to buy.
