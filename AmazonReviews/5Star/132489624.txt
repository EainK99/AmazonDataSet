I read a lot of reviews (both for this model and the other colors) before finally pulling the trigger on this. My main concerns . . .<br /><br />(1) Would it fit me?<br />Yes, the sizing is great (I'm 5'5&#34;). Some reviewers said this guitar was too small and better for &#34;ages 4-7,&#34; but I agree with the manufacturer's recommendation . . . 10 years old is definitely the youngest age that could hold this guitar without difficulty. The size is true to a regular 3/4 short scale guitar intended for adults.<br /><br />(2) Would it stay tuned?<br />I've had no issues thus far. However, BE WARNED that the tuner that comes with it is frustrating and pretty worthless . . . you are better off tuning by ear (lots of videos on YouTube) or buying a quality tuner. The only use for this tuner is perhaps a passive aggressive gift.<br /><br />(3) Would it &#34;feel&#34; like kid-quality guitar?<br />I am satisfied with the overall feel and construction of the guitar. I'm not a musician, though; this was only purchased to play simple songs for a children's story time (and to play with in my own spare time for fun). But it's definitely a solid entry-level guitar.<br /><br />(4) Is it worth it?<br />While I love the guitar, I wouldn't pay the list price (or even half that). I've seen a lot of price fluctuation with this item (as long as you don't want pink), although not so much lately. I would definitely buy a second (to keep at work) if I could snag it at the same price I paid a couple months ago.<br /><br />Also, right now there is a $20 price difference between the guitar &#34;pack&#34; and the guitar by itself. The incidentals aren't really worth $20; you can pick up a strap and a dozen picks as add-on items for much less than that (put the rest toward a tuner!). (Also, as some reviewers have noted, it does only come with three picks, rather than four as shown.)
