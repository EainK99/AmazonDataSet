this guitar is bad azz !!! Sure a lot use them like Slash 4 rock and metal Like Loreta Tharpe and Muddy Waters 4 Blues but I am going to use mine like it was truly meant 4 JAZZ Les Paul was a country player and switched to Jazz get it Jazz!!! So this ax in the Gibson brand name was made4 Les as a Jazz Guitar (technically and truly speaking If not get the video of chasing sound THE STORY OF LES PAUL 2 tell u the TRUTH!!!)!!! THIS AX WILL PLAY THE OTHER  GANARAS  but will be MAINLY USED 4 JAZZ (GET IT) JAZZ!!! Others use it 4 rock like Keith Richard of (rolling stones) and was the 1st 2 take one back 2 England cause they were hard 2 get in U.K. then. then country stars used it but very few 4 jazz. And as the title Implies I also own a sheraton and es 335 Dot and both r Epi's
