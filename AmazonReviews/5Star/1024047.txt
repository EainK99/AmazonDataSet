IIRC, this is the case that normally comes with the Buffet Crampon R-13. It is a high-quality, high-class case all the way around. The interior is a nice, dark blue/black felt and my Yamaha 650 fits perfectly. Buffet thinks of the little details, like finger depressions at the end of the channels for the top and bottom joints so you can lift them out easily. The front section of the case is big enough for swabs, extra reeds, and even my neck strap.<br /><br />Yes, this case is expensive -- but my clarinet is worth it!
