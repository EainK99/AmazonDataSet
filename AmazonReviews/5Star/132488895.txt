This was a really good purchase. More than enough foam to get started with a small studio. This stuff works great for reducing reflections and quieting a room. I was able to put 15 of these up on the wall behind my monitors and still have a bunch leftover to place around the room. I would avoid the included glue and find a different way to mount them. There's lots of info out there on alternatives. I used T pins as a temporary solution to start. Now if they'd only run a special on high quality bass traps...
