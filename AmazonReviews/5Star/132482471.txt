I am young, so I never got to hear records growing up.  I found an old record player at a yard sale, for $20, and tried to use it with my home theater, but it doesn't have an amplifier built in.  You need this product to make it compatible.<br /><br />Now, the reason that this one is the best is because it has a place to put that little green ground wire that is coming out of the record player.  That reduces the humming noise.  Second, this one is RIAA, which means that, you can control the amplification.  Also, this has a low cut for bass.  It has good instructions, too.  My wife has some old Elvis and Beatles records and has been enjoying listening to these ever since this came in the mail.
