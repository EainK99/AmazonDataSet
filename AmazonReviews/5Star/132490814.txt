I have owned the Behringer headphone amps in the past.  They are good but not as good.  Very solid manufacture.  The response on the volume controls is very exact.  It may cost a little more then say the Behringer  but the extra cost is worth it.  I have mine fixed to an area with my snake.  I know you can get send and return balance on the snake but then you do not have volume control for each person.  I use mine in my small recording studio.  If you have a band and like to practice in quit run your board off headphones and each member can have there own volume.  I might buy another for TV use for my wife and I because I love volume high on some programs and she does not.  When I have friends over for the football game and she needs it quiet, well this will do the trick.  But most of all this is great for music!!!!
