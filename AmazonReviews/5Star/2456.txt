I own 6 plastic Ukes: The Outdoor Uke, Woodi, Makala Waterman, Makala Dolphin. The BugsGear has the best action (string height) of them all. It feels great to hold and is comfortable to play. It looks like no other Uke out there and in short, has a very mellow sound for a plastic instrument. I like it a lot but the tuners are a little sloppy, not the best quality. The gig bag is a very nice addition and not some burlap sack with a logo on it. Like all my other plastics Ukes, this one has a permanent place in my rotation and is loads of fun to strum. Kudos for the unique and easy string slots on the bridge. The colors are also awesome.
