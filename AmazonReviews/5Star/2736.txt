I absolutely love these relatively inexpensive headphones. They have a very long sturdy coiled cord, are not head-achingly heavy and sound very good. Trouble free, maintenance free and useful. My first pair of these lasted a couple of years before normal wear-and-tear broke a wire in the left earphone. Before checking the Sennheiser website, and being too cocky about my electronics repair ability, I took the earphone apart and ruined it! Sennheiser has instructions for taking the earphones apart, and they have replacement cable assemblies available for purchase. RTFM! I bought two more of these just so I will have a working pair available no matter what happens. Love these headphones.
