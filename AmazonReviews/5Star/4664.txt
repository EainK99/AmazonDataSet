Like all the other reviews say, this mic sounds impressively good for the price. However, be ready to do some work to get it working right. Like others have mentioned, the mic is internally wired wrong from the factory. It'll take some basic soldering skills to get it working as a balanced mic (other reviewers have posted guides on how to do that). If you do that, you'll also need to replace the cable with a balanced cable. If you don't want to do that and just want to use the mic with the original cable unbalanced, that's fine. But make sure the cable is actually working.<br /><br />My mic started to fail intermittently after about a week of use. Upon investigation, it turned out that the 1/4&#34; end of the cable that came with the mic had been installed wrong. The jacket had been cut back too far so there was nothing for the strain relief clip to grab onto. All of the strain was on the thin copper wiring, and it had started to fray and short. The fix was easy: desolder, cut off an inch or so of cable, cut the jacket back, and resolder. However, I learned a few things cutting back the cable. 1) The wiring is very low quality copper, and there's only a few strands of it. Since it's a decently long cable, this makes me worry about signal loss. 2) There is very little copper shielding wire, and it's in a bundle rather than surrounding the signal wire, so it's not going to do much in the way of shielding.<br /><br />I can't really complain since this is a free cable included with a $10 microphone, but just be warned that this is a likely source for failure. At the very least, be prepared to repair it. If you're picky about sound, replace it.<br /><br />P.S. Like other reviewers have mentioned, you can't run this mic straight into a recording interface and get a useable volume. This mic needs a preamp.<br /><br />UPDATE: After doing an a/b test with this mic using the cable it comes with vs. an $8 Monoprice XLR-1/4 cable, I can confirm that my concerns about shielding were right. The cable provided with this mic adds quite a bit of buzz to the signal. However, there wasn't any noticeable signal loss like I expected.mic adds quite a bit of buzz to the signal.
