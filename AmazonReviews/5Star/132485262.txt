It helped me create better communication with clients by letting them hear for themselves how material will sound on a TV or on PC speakers.<br /><br />When not woth clients - mixing, or just enjoying music - the VRM Box makes prolonged listening easier. The psycho-acustics in this thingy make me feel like the louspeakers are out there and not like I'm wearing them neext to my ear (which is what you actually do with even the best headphones).<br /><br />I put some adhesive stuff under it so it won't fall off my desk.<br /><br />I love it that it was tested with Sennheiser headphones because I'm a Sennheiser kind of guy.
