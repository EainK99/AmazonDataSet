Made like Peanut Butter and Chocolate! They forever go together.<br />I like the construction, snug fit, quality, and the look inside and out. Clean and Classic.<br />There is the usual, but ample storage compartment under the neck space in the case that will be plenty big for your strap, extra strings, tuner, metronome etc.<br />Big Case. Light, Durable, Good Price = Easy YES.
