I am a long time musician and have a lot of quality guitars and basses, this one is great for 85 bucks. I got it to take on raft trips for camp fire jams and I am impressed. Plays well, no crazy rattles or buzzing, I am pleased. Good deal on a quality playable bass that you don't need to worry about. Would also be a good beginner bass, it's loud enough to hear but not so loud that you couldn't play it in an apartment. Feels very close to a regular electric so switching back and forth is easy. Don't be scared of the low price, this bass sounds good.
