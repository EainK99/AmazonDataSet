I purchased this unit to record my sermons on my Sony HDR-CX380 digital camcorder.  So far I have been less than about 35 feet away, but the unit worked flawlessly.  It allowed me to record the sermons very clearly, just like I was standing next to the camcorder.  I didn't pick up all the &#34;hollow sounding echo&#34; that I would have if I had relied on the built in mic on the camcorder.  The only trouble I have had thus far was in trying to use a Pro Lavalier Lapel Microphone JK MIC-J 016 instead of the supplied lapel mike.  Perhaps it was because the Pro Lavalier mic has a stereo plug and the one on the Azden is mono.  I'll try using a stereo - mono adapter to see if this works better, or if it was a non-functioning mic.  But, this is not the fault of the Azden unit that seems to be working perfectly.
