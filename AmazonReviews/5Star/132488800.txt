I have had a few other Dean guitars in the past (Evo Noir, Razorback w/ Floyd Rose, Black Gold ML). I sold them all and decided to get back in to playing with this. (The seller shipped me the non-killswitch model, but it's basically the same). I can't comment on any killswitch features, but since they're the same guitar, just different finish and the addition of the killswitch, I figured a review would be ok.<br /><br />The action on this guitar is amazing. Dean really does some nice final setup before letting a guitar roll out the door. I'm having a blast learning how to play again on this guitar and I couldn't be happier. The build is solid, it looks amazing, and plays great! For the price, you can't beat it!
