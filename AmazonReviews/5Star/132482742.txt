I have a few children in my care at Oni Daycare Inc, and I love to trick them by hiding in the janitor closet and using this microphone with a pitch corrector to make an ominous booming voice, disillusioned into a religious belief that I am, in fact, Indiana Jones. Sometimes they don't fully believe it, at which point I direct my wife to force them into wearing headphones, and I turn on the stereo mode for the microphone so I can whisper &#34;woolooloolooloo&#34; into each side, cradling them into a deep sleep where I can caress their childlike heads in admiration while fondling my Blue Yeti.
