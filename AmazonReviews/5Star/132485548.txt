I received my Pulmonica as a gift. I've always loved the magic of harmonicas and although I didn't think I had a health-related reason to use THIS one, I was glad to see if I could develop a talent for music with it. This is too crazy! I had smoked for 30 years, and combined with a hellish array of allergies, combined with the fact that I'm a very shallow breather, I didn't expect to have much \\"wind\\" to last long with it. But the challenge turned out to be more than just fun; my congestion issues are quickly improving, and I'm sleeping better. I've also had a big reduction of headaches, but it's only been a month so I can't say if that is coincidence or not. My 'trick' to remembering to use it daily is to keep it by my favorite TV chair. When the commercials that get me grinding my teeth come on, I just blow my Pulmonica instead of listening to them. Or I try to play along with their background music. (Don't ask my husband how THAT is going!) I still hate them, but at least now I am using them to my benefit instead of feeling like I'm being held hostage by senseless commercials every time I want to watch a show. This really seems to be an excellent way to improve respiratory function, and at my age, I'm finally getting serious about my health maintenance. My next-door neighbor was on a respirator his last few years, only being able to puff out 2-4 words at a time, and I don't want to live like that. So I'm going to take control now. I'll update my review in a few months, after I have some long-term results to report. But the best news, already, is that it can't hurt anyone, it can only improve lung strength and capacity. Who doesn't need that?
