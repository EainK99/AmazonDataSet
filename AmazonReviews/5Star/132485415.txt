I have been playing one of these very actively for almost two years and just love it.  Has a fabulous range of deep bass and high slaps, and the ability to easily tune it up or down for variations in humidity is a great plus.  It's also great looking and well made.  I get lots of compliments from others, especially when they hear the bass tones.  Have played many djembes and wouldn't trade mine for any of them.  The [[ASIN:B001XWGX0A Meinl Deluxe Djembe Bag]] fits it like a glove, and I can also recommend it.
