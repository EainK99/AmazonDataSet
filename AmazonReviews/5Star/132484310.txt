I run a melodrama theater and take shows out to restaurants for diner theater.  The equipment worked flawlessly.  I do have a sound engineer who set it up and watched it throughout but I was thrilled.  All the bad reviews that I read were based on older equipment.  The company has definitely gone to school and fixed the reported problems.  It was great.
