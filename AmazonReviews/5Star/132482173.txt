If you travel a lot Mono cases are worth there weight in gold. When I fly I never worry about my instruments, whether they are in the overhead compartment or in the hole of the plane Mono cases offer the ultimate protection. I have the double bass bag and I carry one bass and one guitar in it, all together I have 4 Mono products.
