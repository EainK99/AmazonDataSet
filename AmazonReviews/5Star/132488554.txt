The HD681 EVO Superluxes are absolutely wonderful open ear headphones.<br />By no means am I an audiophile, but as far as I can tell the sound quality is very balanced and warm.<br />Ear pads are very comfortable for prolonged use, and the headband strap sits nicely.<br />10/10, excellent value would recommend.
