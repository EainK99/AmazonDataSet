At first I was a little apprehensive, but after I replaced the strings and set up the action, The DMS came alive! I believe the instrument speaks for it's self and is a whole lot of bang for the buck..... Sounds incredible through an amp as well! Been playing for 30+ years........Thumbs up on this one, very glad I bought it.
