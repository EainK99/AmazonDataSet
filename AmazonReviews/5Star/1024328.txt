My wife is Hawaiian so this was a just because gift. The shipping was very good. Received it before guesstimate time/date. She was more than thrilled. Brought her back to her playing days. Product was very nice and with the auto tuner and carrying case, it made it more than what was expected for the price. Which was very good. The company that the uke was purchased from had more than what I really wanted to look for but compromised on this uke. Everyone was happy.
