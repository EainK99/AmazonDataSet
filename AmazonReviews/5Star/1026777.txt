I have a 30 year old epiphone accubass that I love to play. Flat wound has always been my favorite because I can slide up and down the strings and get that &#34;WOW&#34; sound without the string noise. I always felt that the bright sound loss from flats could be compensated with the amp. These Fender strings are the brightest flats I have used and the sustain is much longer. For the &#34;round wound&#34; fans that want the &#34;flats&#34; ease to play TRY THESE.
