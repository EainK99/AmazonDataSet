These waterproof lights are amazing.  I purchased this product at a discount rate for my unbiased review and I am in awe at how amazing these lights are.  It is a very easy set up, plug the lights into the adaptor and plug it into an outlet.  There is a remote on the plug so you can decide how you want your lights to work, by music / Just Red / Just Blue / Just Green / Alternating colors.  I plugged these in yesterday before I got ready to put them around my pool deck and was blown away.<br /><br />Also, when you have the lights set to the music setting the colors will change just to your voice there is not plugging them into a phone or radio for it to work.  GREAT GREAT product!
