I bought this case for my 12 string Takamine Jumbo Cutaway guitar. My guitar is really big not like ur ordinary guitar and i was a little scared when i ordered this case thinking it wasnt gonna fit but it actually did fit. Good price, and good material, guitar fit a little tight but the cushion will adjust to the guitar because its new. Recommend this coming from a musician who plays every weekend!! :)
