Great fun for my girl on her first birthday :)  Inexpensive, well made, she shakes and bangs on it and it has no sign of wear and tear so far.  My soon-to-be 3 year old is also enjoying it.  I got the purple color, very pretty!  Not the typical toy, and not loud like drums so parents can rest easy :)
