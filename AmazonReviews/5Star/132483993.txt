so i got this guitar on special ($135) and i must say its definitely worth every penny and more but there are some things you should consider before buying it.<br /><br />I was very hesitant at first because this particular model has 2 reviews in all of the internet and both from costumers that just said its a pretty guitar for a nice price). But since its a Dean i decided to give it a shot and worst case scenario i'd just return it since i got amazon prime.<br /><br />so i ordered and the guitar arrived with 2 day shipping, the unboxing was standard, in the box was the guitar wrapped in soft paper and it only had the receipt and a tag from addario strings letting you know what you were getting ( they are thin gauge strings by the way). the guitar was semi-tuned and ready to play<br /><br />now to the body of the guitar, its a little on the plain side although i love the way the saddle looks, the nut and bridge have ridiculous low action which makes it ultra playable and will never hurt your fingers. all frets sound clean and there is no buzzing notes whatsoever.<br /><br />now the only con of this guitar i've found so far is the body, i love the shape but the material is very light and feels a little bit on the cheap side and the sound is very bright, do  not expect warm bassy tones unless you are tuning drop d or c, and even so i would recommend swapping the strings for mediums or thicker ones. but another aspect to consider about this is when you play plugged into an amp the sound is very similar to that of an electric guitar which i liked. when plugged in to an amplifier i recommend setting treb and mid to 2 and 3 ( in a scale of 1-10) and the bass up to a 9, keep presence at a 4<br /><br />now one of the things i really liked is the way it picks up harmonics effortlessly and the width of the neck is not too thin or too thick it feels just right ( i have average size hands for a 5'11 tall man)<br /><br />the pickups and pre-amp work very well  it sounds very clean and  its straightforward to use, it comes with a cheap branded battery that should give you a month or 2 of medium use. it has 2 strap pins, one positioned in the bottom, and the other on the cutaway ( i have not tried them but they look kinda cool xD)<br /><br />so far the guitar has stayed in tune even if i leave it for 2 or 3 days without playing.<br /><br />finally, i wont say this guitar can outperform $500+ guitars but it is definitely a great option for someone starting out or needs a laid back guitar since its so easy and comfortable to play.
