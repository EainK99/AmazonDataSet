Arrived well packaged. I got it for $300 and it appears worth it. It is metal with some wood attached. Nothing going to happen to the metal, but the wood is another matter. A good thing it's too heavy for a strap. Playing seated and use some care when you port it and it should be OK. Sound is awesome. Afro blues thing. I mostly use a pick and my middle finger. The metal catches harmonics and expands single notes. Gauge is heavy for bends (I may experiment a bit), but I got it for slide which I haven't tried yet. Will obviously use open tuning which will lessen tension. Bottom line: if you are addicted to guitars, you probably already have one or something like it. If you don't, when it comes on sale, get one.
