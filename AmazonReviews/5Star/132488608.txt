I am a regular performing gospel/funk drummer and I have owned this pedal for 3 years now. I am absolutely in love with it.<br />My previous pedal was an older single DW9000, and this pedal just blows it away. The action is precise, responsive and incredibly smooth. It is amazingly light but in no way cheap feeling. Many who have tried my pedal fall in love with it as well. I occasionally let my close friends gig with because they prefer it over their own.<br />The only modification I made was replacing the hard plastic Axis beater with a PureSound Speedball felt beater. I did this is because of personal taste not because the beater was inferior in any way.<br />I recommend this pedal to anyone looking to upgrade to a nicer pedal. I found not many stores carry it in my area, but if its at a store in your area try it for yourself.
