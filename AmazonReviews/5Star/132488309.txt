This is one great pick, I play a lot of fast leads and this cuts the sonic butter like a hot knife.<br />Its quite comfortable to hold and play with, I noticed the Big Stubby 3.0 ended up giving me a strain on my right thumb, so I started looking for a replacement. Im using it for metal rythm and lead playing.
