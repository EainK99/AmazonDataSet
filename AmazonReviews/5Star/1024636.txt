This microphone is a great value for the price.  Be warned that you will not get &#34;professional&#34; (a.k.a. recording studio) sound out of it, but it is a vast improvement over most other similarly priced microphones.  For under $25 it will get the job done for school presentations or other simple recordings.  If you need absolutely crystal clear sound quality then you will need to spend considerably more money.
