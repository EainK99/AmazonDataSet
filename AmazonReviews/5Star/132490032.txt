This useful little capo is very easy to carry with you since it is on a keyring.  And it is a nice size to fit easily in your pocket. The package insert includes clear instructions and links to download three cool songs, and access to a Scottish music show.  There is a website where you can post your videos of you playing using the capo. And you can win monthly prizes.  So I think that capo is a very good deal, and an excellent addition ot my music equipment.  I recommend it.
