Was hesitant to buy due to lack of good reviews so I called KaraokeCenter in Canada to ask how it was and he said it worked good.<br />So I took a leap of faith and bought one as I could find no other solution for mixing HDMI with audio on the cheap.<br />You see my wife likes Karaoke and I have a tablet and also a MINIpc with XBMC or Kodi so I can either send karaoke videos through my Stereo receiver and TV either way, but when I wanted to mix Mic audio at the same time that was the problem.<br />Well installing this unit between my receiver and minipc or tablet is just two hdmi connections plus power.<br />How did it work?<br />Perfect....<br />The mic is very good quality, the sound is very good for voice, in fact cannot be much better unless you have invested thousands.<br />I turned the song audio off and left the mic volume on and there is just the slightest hum at higher volumes but it is almost imperceptible unless you are a fanatic and in a normal use situation no distortion is heard.<br />The echo effect works fine and again no distortion from using this at all. On the spec sheet it mentions it is a yamaha chipset and it worked great I found though I tended to not use it in the end unless you want a concert hall effect.<br />So ya, go buy it it is worth it and no idea about those other peeps who maybe have feedback loops in their home wiring, but then again they prob have no idea what I am talking about anyways, lol.
