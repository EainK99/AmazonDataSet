Works great. Having the removable sponge is a big improvement from the older versions that used a syringe. No need to buy super expensive humidification kits. If you play your guitar semi frequently and check that there's enough moisture in the sponge each time, all is good. Very happy. Doesn't drip, super easy to install. Guitar moisturizer fill in once a month for optimal humidity and enhanced guitar tone. I received this for free in exchange of my unbiased review.
