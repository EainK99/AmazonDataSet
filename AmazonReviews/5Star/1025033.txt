What a great tuner, especially for the price! Ordered Monday, received and e-mail on Tuesday from the seller with manual attachment, and received it on Wednesday. Tuned my guitar and ukulele within 5 minutes of opening the package. Large display and color coding circle makes it very easy to tune. I would highly recommend this product even if you only need a tuner for one instrument.
