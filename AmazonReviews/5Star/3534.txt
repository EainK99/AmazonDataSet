Exactly as described, this guitar stand is well made.  It's easily assembled with no tools, and thumb screws secure the padded contact bars to the frame. The rubberized foam padding looks durable and is both stick and protective.  Your guitars lean well to the side, so there is no risk of of them coming out when placed. The stand must be placed back from a wall so the heartsick won't touch that however. Every contact point is padded.  Although I have 10 plus guitars, it's unlikely I will fill all the spaces on this stand at one time. However, 3 guitars out is normal, and this is far more secure than individual stands which can tip over if jostled.  Highly recommended if you have several instruments out a time - playing with a buddy or bringing out some to show.
