Wow. Everything the TC Polytune pedal has, in a clip on tuner. You can tune individual strings or all 6 at once. The interface is intuitive and simple, and the display is easy to read in sunlight or in the dark. It may be more than the cheapie monotone tuners, but it's fast, super accurate and easy to use.<br /><br />In non-strobe mode it's +/- 1 cent accurate, and in strobe mode it's +/- 0.1 cent accurate. Basically if you can't get in tune with this your guitar is broken.
