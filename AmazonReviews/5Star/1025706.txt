This bag exceeded my expectations - lots of padding, well-constructed, plenty of room, and a great price.  Fits all my 14-inch snare drums from 4&#34; piccolo to 6 1/2, which is really nice.  A little snug for those drums that have majorly overhanging snare strainers and butts (like Premier One Series), but they still fit fine.
