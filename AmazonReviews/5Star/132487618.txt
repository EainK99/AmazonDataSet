Bought these, read a few negative reviews about comfort and sound quality, not true. These are very comfortable even for extended wear, the sound quality is excellent. I have an amateur recording studio, I lay down multiple music tracks and then do a voice over recording while listening to the music. I have to hear my voice as I am doing this and these do the trick without contaminating the voice track with the music from the semi open design of the headphones. The price is great. You will love them.
