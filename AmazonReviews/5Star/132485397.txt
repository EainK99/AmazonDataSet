I love these strings cause they are straight up economical yet great sounding.  The heaviness of the strings provides a boomy yet distinct low end that is consistent and true.  I love them and for the price you can't go wrong.  I slap these on my Fender P bass and it's straight up thump and go.  I've heard people say they sound to muddled but Ive never felt that way about them.  Work horse strings.  Keep extras on hand in case I go nuts plucking and they snap however that rarely happens.  Very sharp on the slap end of things.  Troof.
