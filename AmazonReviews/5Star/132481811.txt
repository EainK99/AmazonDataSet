I love these speakers. I picked up a pair as soon as they came out and these are 100% worth the money. I mostly make electronic music and these are invaluable for getting a good mixdown. Without super perfect acoustics, mixing on these can be a little confusing at first, but once you get a feel for whatever room you're producing in, they're an extremely powerful asset.<br /><br />Also, often when I mix on these I find myself emphasizing one instrument or frequency range to make it more present (for example the lead synth). Ideally, you should mix so that you can hear all the levels on these, which is somewhat counter-intuitive, but when you take your creation to regular consumer-grade speakers, you will definitely notice the clarity and your only limitation using these is your mixing/mastering skill.<br /><br />5/5 Highly recommended. Great job Yamaha.
