This repair kit was delivered when promised and it contained all of the parts shown in the photo. The repair parts were installed and all fit perfectly. The main reason for ordering this kit was to replace valve piston guides and springs. The original valve guides were worn and sticking, and the springs had different compression pressures for each valve. The valves now feel and function like new ones. I recommend this seller if you need repair parts for certain vintage and current trumpets. Hopefully, A-Z Parts will expand its product offerings on Amazon. I am very pleased with this purchase.
