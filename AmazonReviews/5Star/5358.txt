I used this to custom mount my Snowball Ice microphone, instead of using the included tripod which stood too tall for the space I wanted to fit it in. I didn't need the mic to pick anything up from above it, so it is sitting on a shelf with wood above it, in a small enough space that do-it-yourself mounting made more sense. So I put it on a circular piece of wood from a local craft store (only a dollar), gave the wood a few coats of white spray paint (also only a dollar) and had a 5 dollar custom mounted white-and-chrome Snowball Ice microphone that picks up my whole living room. I pre-drilled the holes using the ProRockGear base as a guide, put the screws in with a screwdriver. Easy and beautiful.
