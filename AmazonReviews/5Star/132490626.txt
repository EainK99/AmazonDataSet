This is my second bag that I buy, very compact and fits in the trunk of your car.Protects the shells nicely, bells and even a cymbal fit inside, nice pockets on the inside of the end panels to store your bells and other stuff, you carry two bags and that's it, no multiple bags for everything and the chance of leaving something behind at home or coming out of a gig. Try it, you'll like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
