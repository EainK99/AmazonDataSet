This is a great little uke for the money... I've bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts... As many have noted, tuning stability improves GREATLY after the strings stretch in... One suggestion - If you're willing to add a 4-7 bucks to the purchase price, buy a set of D'Addario or Aquila strings and put them on right away... The stock strings are pretty poor, even a set of 4 dollar strings is a vast improvement. Other than that, I love these little guys, and plan to keep on buying them... Finally, if you buy this (or any other uke) do yourself a favor and watch the movie \\"Mighty Uke\\"... You won't stop smiling...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002H0LQO D'Addario J65 Ukulele Strings, Soprano]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003NJF1G8 Aquila AQ-S Nylgut Soprano Ukulele Strings]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004JST26W Mighty Uke: The Amazing Comeback of a Musical Underdog]]
