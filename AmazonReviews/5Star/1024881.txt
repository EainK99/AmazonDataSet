I had already bought myself a Souldier Constantine guitar strap and this next one was for my brother who also plays guitar but has been playing longer than I have. I gave this strap to my brother for his birthday he has a Koi Pond in his backyard and he said that he really like the design and how well made it is. Good for this company to make guitar straps from recycled seat belts a product that people use every day and are comfortable with. These straps are well made,comfortable,and not hard on the pay check, well worth the money.
