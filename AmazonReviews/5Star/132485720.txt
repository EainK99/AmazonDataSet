This is as good an amp as I've seen in this price range. There are other amps from other pro manufacturers that cost about the same, but will not run down to 2 ohms. Those amps offer a similar 100Hz crossover, but only allow the amp to be used with one channel for high frequency and the other for low. The ProLite allows each side to be selected for high, low or full range.<br />Although it is not incredibly powerful at 280 watts per channel at 8 ohms, it puts out substantially more power each time the impedance is lowered by the addition of another speaker. At 4ohms in bridged mode, it produced nearly 2000 watts, making this a pretty great, lightweight \\"building block\\" of an amplifier. Start small, bridge later for big systems. No complaints. Just know what you're doing and you'll get incredible bang for the buck.
