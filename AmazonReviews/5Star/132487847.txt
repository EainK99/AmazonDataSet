I have always used Shaller strap locks, and had one set fail after a couple years of use, the bottom one let go and my guitar swung to the ground like an ax on a pendulum. I was lucky enough to catch it before it hit the ground. about 8 years ago I bought a new fender that came with a set of these, the design is much better than any of the other ones out there, the piece that goes on the strap is kind of U shaped so even if the lock itself fails the guitar strap buttons are still cradled in the U. I bought this set to put on my Gibson. These have the best design on the market. Highly recommended.
