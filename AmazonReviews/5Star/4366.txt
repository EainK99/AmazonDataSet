My 10 year old began playing his father's alto saxophone but the old case was heavy and didn't close tightly.  This case was perfect for taking the instrument to school 2 days a week - not as heavy as a plastic case, well padded, and comes with backpack straps.  This case won't protect as well as a hard plastic case, but is perfect for our needs right now.
