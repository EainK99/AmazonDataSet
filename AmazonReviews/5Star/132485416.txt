I like this product allot, this stops the noise when practicing and allows others to enjoy the room.  It was a new item the price was write if I need another I will use this seller again for this type of product considering the vox brand is way to over priced.  You can find the vox brand in any retail musical location but they range from 59 dollars and up.  Seller I would like to thank him for being reasonable and not trying to gouge the consumers.  You have my business keep these on stock also could you try and get the bass version in your inventory.  Thanks again the consumer
