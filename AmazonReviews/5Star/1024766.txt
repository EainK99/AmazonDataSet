This is an OSP (Official Sigler Product) house branded microphone from siglermusiconline. I picked up one of these great multi-pattern condenser mics from a local Craigslist ad, and it has been a fantastic purchase! Definitely comparable to our church's AT-4040 mic in every way.<br /><br />Here are our usual pros/cons, starting with the pros:<br /> + the original mic came with an aluminum case with foam inserts for the mic, a foam mic shield, and a custom shock mount<br /> + the cardiod, figure 8, and omnidirectional modes all have work well with similar response to other large diaphragm condenser mics<br /> + low-pass cutoff switch as on most comparable condenser mics<br /> + sound quality on par with comparable Audio-Technica AT-4040<br /><br />and the cons:<br /> - this mic is no longer offered by siglermusiconline, thus no info on support issues or possible repair options<br /><br />Net: available these days for ~$100 used. Check one out, great buy for that price.
