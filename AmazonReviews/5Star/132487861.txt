Not that I'm extraordinary at working the Tin Sandwich, however, been feeling my way around a guitar fret board since 1964. So it's long past due that I pursue harmonica playing, it is so pleasing to listen to. Well, have to have a Golden Melody , Special 20, Seydel, and Blues Master, because they are great as can be. The Suzuki Harpmaster has all the pieces fall in just the right places. If you've been searching and wondering, then the list above won't disappoint. The Harpmaster blows the roof off my highest expectations!
