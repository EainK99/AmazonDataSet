There are so many headphones out there, the choices were overwhelming. I got these after reading article after article for about 3 weeks. My local Best Buy pushed Beats and Bose for high end, but no Sennheiser (600's on up). My town doesn't offer a store with high end headphones, so I was taking a risk when I pulled the trigger on these. Remember, everyones processing of noise is different and though these may be perfect for me it may not be perfect for you.<br /><br />My other review for the AudioEngine D1 DAC talks about my set up (and my background), but a couple things changed since then. I use this with the mentioned DAC on an iMac (2010) and Macbook Pro (2012) using iTunes with Amarra (full version). I also used this on my Pioneer VSX-521 Receiver (not high end, but had it for a while) with my laptop/DAC plugged in; set to Direct Mode. This allowed me to have amplification without the receiver processing the sound with unneeded filters.<br /><br />The headphones were packed in a blue/grey Sennheiser box. It's cardboard, but thicker and tougher with little metal hinges to open the lid. Inside the headphone were nestled in molded foam. It also came with a 1/4\\" to 1/8\\" adapter. I chuckled a bit because I haven't seen an 1/4\\" plug since I was a kid.<br /><br />I was worried after spending the money that my DAC wouldn't push these monsters. I completely forgot these were NON-POWERED phones, but my DAC worked quite well with them. These should not be used for an iPod or phone (according to articles), but I was surprised at the sound using my iPhone 4S and Bongiovi's DSP app (volume at 9). This was just a test, not normal use.<br /><br />The sound was extraordinary to my ears. I first tested it on a 24/96 version of the Brandenburg Concertos and was amazed of the separation of the lows, mids, and highs. I could distinctively focus on each instrument. I then tested this on a 24/96 version of Dark Side of the Moon. Though my QC15's were good, these phones were amazingwhen listening to more demanding music such as Classical or Progressive. It's been a couple of weeks and they've changed the way I listen to music. I can't even read to music anymore with these on because I'm too focused on the sounds coming at me.<br /><br />There are enough reviews out there for the HD650 to make a good informed decision, but as I said, it's subjective for every person. I plan on building a Crack Headphone Amp to power these even further, but right now I'm loving what I'm hearing.
