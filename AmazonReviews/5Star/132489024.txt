Let me start by saying that I am 100% satisfied with the out of box performance with this power amplifier. It is a budget amp, but it does provide good clean power to my set of full-range speaker cabinets. Here are my specifications...<br /><br />Cab 1: One tweeter, one mid-frequency speaker, one subwoofer. I don't know the wattage of the mid/high speakers, but the subwoofer is rated at 150 watts RMS/ 300 watts peak and is a SVC 4 ohm driver.<br /><br />Cab 2: One tweeter, one mid-frequency speaker, one subwoofer. The mid/high speakers are the same in cab 1, but the subwoofer is rated at 300 watts RMS/ 1000 watts peak and is a DVC 4 ohm driver.<br /><br />Unfortunately I do not know what impedance each cabinet is running at because I do not know the exactly specifications of the mid/high drivers.<br /><br />While the PQA3100 is running in stereo it has plenty of power to run both subwoofers efficiently. To put it into perspective for you visual folks, I have a 2200 sq/ft house and the floor shakes on the opposite corner when it's turned up to a medium/high volume. Yes, the fan can be heard from a few feet away in open air space but your music will drown that out just fine, especially if you have it mounted in a rack. I have not experienced any hissing, humming or distortion in my signal at all, and my speaker wire is run under the carpet in my basement.<br /><br />Just to clarify... during my testing I checked one channel at a time with both of my cabinets. The audio was provided by my cell phone via the RCA input. In the future i'll likely be using a small passive mixer to accommodate a handful of devices at once.<br /><br />I do not have a way of measuring the exact power from the amplifier but it seems to be putting something in the realm of 900 watts of constant power and 1800 watts peak. This amplifier has the ability to run two of my larger subwoofers in stereo mode (if I had an extra) but it probably isn't going to over power them. I am rating this amplifierwith 5 stars because as long as you apply it to a realistic setup it will work exceptionally well for the money. Budget amplifiers at this price range/ power rating ratio are typically over rated if all you go by is the model number.
