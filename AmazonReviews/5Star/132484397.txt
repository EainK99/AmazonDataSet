My son bought this Encore 5 Upgrade without knowing that one needed the full version of Encore 5 all ready installed in the computer. Therefore, he was not able to use it. When the package arrived in the USPS, it was never opened and was returned. Now he's going to purchase the full version of Encore 5 which I have used for years and really believe in this product.
