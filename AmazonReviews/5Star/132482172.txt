I have a $700 setup with a Heil PR40 and a Heil boom much like this one. I wanted a secondary in studio mic for a guest if they were to come in. Well I had the ATR 2100 on a tripod stand on the desk and my guest had to keep looking down at the mic and it really screwed up the conversation flow that we had. I was on my boom mic so I could look at him while I would talk and he would look back at me and lose his audio quality. This boom solved it. I took a gamble, hoping it would fit the Audio Technica ATR2100 but it doesn't! However if you look in my product photo that I added you can see that if you just wrap something around the circumference of the ATR2100 you can make it fit snugly just fine. I used a sock but a more professional setup would be some foam or rubber. It doesn't hurt the audio quality at all and works just fine. The setup is cheap, but it is the best bang for your buck if you're looking to get a good sounding mic setup for under $100. Boom mics are a must have. I'm buying a second setup incase I  have two guests in studio.
