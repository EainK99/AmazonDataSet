First one I bought didn't have the top bolt weld ground flat on the inside so it would not sit flat on a table top & would scratch it.  I applied 4 self stick rubber feet under each corner and it holds super solid with no scratching.  Just ordered 2 more and will use rubber feet on those as well, because they help it grip so well.<br /><br />For those who haven't noticed, or thought of it, the plastic end of clamping screw has V shaped grooves that allow it to be clamped to a round pipe or stand column.  It is not as solid but works OK for lighter duty apps.<br /><br />Would be nice if they included a $.01 lock nut for the mic, like they do with their \\"POSI-LOC\\" \\"mini-mini boom\\".<br /><br />The metal seems to be heat treated, as it shows no sign of flexing when clamped very tight.
