Purchase this set for our 2 year old grand daughter. Didn't want a set that is going to fall apart in days of toddler abuse.  This set is holding up very well.  The only negative I have to say is that the instructions appeared to be photo copies and were difficult to read, hence it took us a little longer to put together than expected.  But the end result was very much worth it.
