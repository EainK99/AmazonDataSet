I've only used this bag a couple of times, but I REALLY like it so far.  It's spacious, and there's plenty of room for all of my cymbal stands.  I haven't put it through a vigorous durability test, but the bag seems to be made out of some pretty durable material.  It makes transporting my gear much easier.
