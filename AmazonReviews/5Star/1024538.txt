My teenage son absolutely ADORES THIS! It replaces the need for thousands of dollars of equipment. At least that is what things used to cost to sound like this, and it's nice and portable to. A definite winner! It makes him sound like he's in a recording studio jamming, and it's much more basic and easy to use and change things around than the Fender model for younger and/or more inexperienced users, so we are REALLY glad we picked this for our special man! 10 stars!!!!!
