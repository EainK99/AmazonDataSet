Though I can't speak to it's durability (as I've only had the capo a few days) it is a great capo.  It makes a fast, clean \\"grab\\" every time, with no dead spots or pinched strings.  The Kava is sleek, easy to use one-handed, and doesn't get in the way even when placed high up the neck.  It's a great capo for the price.  The independent seller was great too... friendly, fast service.  I'm very pleased.
