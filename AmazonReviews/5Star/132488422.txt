I conduct an Orchestra of 40 elementary school students.  After having my voice suffer from trying to talk over their playing, I decided I needed a wireless headset microphone for rehearsals.  I ordered the Hisonic Portable PA after reading the reviews and have been VERY PLEASED with its performance so far.  It's loud enough to carry over the orchestra.  There are also inputs on the side for other devices, including iPods and CD players which I use for play-along tracks.  It's portability and rechargeable batteries mean that I can go anywhere with it.<br /><br />The hand-held mic works well, too.  I did have some trouble getting the lavalier/lapel mic to pick up my voice.  But, that's not a problem since I prefer the headset.
