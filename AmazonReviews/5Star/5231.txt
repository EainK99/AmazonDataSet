This red Snark SN-2 ALL INSTRUMENT clip on tuner works very well, exactly as described!!  Our school highly encourages all students to use this too.  In addition to how well it works, it is cheap enough in cost to replace if your child/student loses it!! We have several kids who all play instruments.  This is a valuable and handy item to own.  We use this with tenor and alto saxophones and trumpet.
