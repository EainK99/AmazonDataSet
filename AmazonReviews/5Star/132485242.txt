These lights were honestly pretty cool . i bought them cause i wanted lights in my basement . i wanted either neon or led's . i was going to go with neon but i did some research and i found out leds are brighter ,use less power , and arent near as bulky as neon glass tubes . so i bought these and i was amazed . the lights come in a box with a adapter for a 3 prong outlet . it almost looks like a laptop charger . a pretty long chord . a remote . and the spool of lights . when i took them out . i plugged the adapter into my wall outlet and ran it through my ceiling . there is one important part . on the adapter end . theres a little white choard that looks weird . its a sensor . its the thing that senses the remotes actions . the light strip has a double sided tape on the bottom but surprisingly it works fairly well . i haven't had any problems yet . one of my favorite things about the lights are there not that long . but at the end of the spool theres 3 open wires and you can attach more lines too it . so if you want a few lights is works and if you want a lot you can buy extra spools of lights and attach them from the 3 open wires . the only thing is those extra spools cost about 20.00 bucks . but i love the lights . right now i only have 1 spool up but im looking to get more eventualy . anyways about  the performance of the lights . the lights work great ! . i have one spool up and i think its 16 feet . and and pretty large basement and the lights light up the whole thing . its like the stock lights that are in the ceiling. but theres so much more too them . they do all sorts of things . they strobe white and you can pick the speeds . they do all sorts of diffrent pre set motions and you can even make your own color . its pretty cool too be honest . but theres also a hole set of solid lights . theres a ton of them . i read some of the comments before i bought them and i noticed someone said not all the buttens work on the controller but thats not true . they all dosomething its just a little bit confusing what does what .<br /><br />well. too rap up my review .i just need to say i love these lights . i would recommend these to anyone who was looking for something like this . these are great and completely worth the money .<br /><br />PROS<br />_______<br /><br />bright<br />easy to use<br />cool<br />all sorts of colors and movements<br />ect..<br /><br />cons<br />________<br />adhesive tape is the greatest . its nice but not the best<br />sometimes its difficult to get the sensor to read the remote .<br />remotes confusing<br /><br />also ive had these light for about 5 months . so all the information is referring to the time ive had them
