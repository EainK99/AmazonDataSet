I have many distortion pedals, they all sound different,  but in a good way, I really like this pedal.  It doesn't go over the top, but gives a good range of tones.  It is a little &#34;clunky&#34; if that is a word---but I think you know what I mean.  I like classic rock, 80's hair bands, and some grunge rock, this pedal does a great job for those styles.  It can also go softer if needed, it is a great addition to my collection.  I do recommend it.
