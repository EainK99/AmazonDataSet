I bought two of these mic cables to use regularly on my gigs. After several months of repeated use, they're still holding up perfectly and haven't given me the slightest hiccup.<br /><br />The reason I chose CBI is because I've purchased and used several of their eight-channel, multi-track recording snakes, and in the ten years I used them, I never ran into a single problem. The mic cables are proving to be just as well-built. CBI's cables' solder joints stay connected, their conductors' insulation doesn't stress and pull away, and their jackets never crack. Usually a cable will suffer from one of those three problems, but CBI seems to have found a way to make it all work for a very affordable price.
