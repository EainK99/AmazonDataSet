My daughter ordered the strap and had her husband's name engraved on it for a surprise 50th birthday present (he is a musician), they were both very happy with it. The engraving and detail is beautiful workmanship and the seller sent it before it was promised so it was received in plenty of time for his birthday party.  She had it sent to my house so that it would be a total surprise and it was.  We would use this seller again, great product with excellent workmanship and delivered the product early and without any problems.
