YES! I can now hold the violin with just my chin and shoulder, with the left thumb/hand focused on the strings.  I'm holding it right now while typing this.  Before acquiring this supportive unit, I spent several weeks without one trying to learn violin with a contorted neck and left hand distracted by supporting the instrument.  Some youtube video teachers make a rest sound optional; however, for me (and others with a normal-size neck) it now seems required.  The all-black design avoids viewers being distracted by your rest -- I've seen yellow ones and other colors and wondered why clash with the beautiful wood-grained form you're holding?) The rest slips on and off easily.  The violin case is not large enough to keep it on all the time.
