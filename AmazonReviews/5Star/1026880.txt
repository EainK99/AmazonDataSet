I am amazed at how lightweight this little unit is. It's compact and it is extremely easy to install. I can tell the difference between the audio projects I recorded with the unit and without the unit. Even though I have sound dampening foam around my recording studio, using the isolator produces a much cleaner sound. I highly recommend it for anyone who does voice recordings.
