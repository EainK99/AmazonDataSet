So I bought these for the purpose of filling my dorm room with beautiful sound. They're wonderful. The mp3 cable and port that come with it make it easy for people to come in and show me cool music, and equally easy for me to plug in and unplug my laptop between classes for a quick jam session. Usability is amazing.<br /><br />Audio quality. I have very little experience differentiating speakers from each other. With that perspective in mind, they sound infinitely better than my laptop built in speakers. They make music more engaging to listen to, with very clear sound at all levels of volume. I can play jazz and people besides me like it. They're cheaper than the AudioEngine model comperable to this set, and I'm sure they're equal in value.<br /><br />I fully endorse these speakers, and I've owned them for about a month with no sign of wear. I love these babies, do yourself a favor and pick them up if you've got a smaller room to fill with music!
