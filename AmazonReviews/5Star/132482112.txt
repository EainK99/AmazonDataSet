I had been using the previous version of these with the short cord and a Shure microphone extension for about three years.  Unfortunately, the right earpiece stopped working, so I ordered this one with the replacement microphone and controller for iPhones.  The design whereby the cord attaches directly to the earpiece should mean that one will not need to throw away the entire headset when a wire frays.  It uses the same replacement inserts as the previous one (good, since I still have a dozen of them), and inserts in the ear the same way, except that it lies flatter.  For me, the medium insert cuts out some ambient sound, but I can still hear enough that it is safe to use while walking outside. The sound quality is more than adequate for mp3's and internet streaming (the only things for which I have used them).
