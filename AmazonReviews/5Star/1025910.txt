It is what I hoped it would be..a reasonable cover/container for my Yamaha MG166CX mixer. Short of a professional hard-sided travel case for ultimate protection. It does what I need and the mixer fits like a champ inside. It has the usual solid Gator quality that we all have come to depend on. Tough exterior. Good zippers. Reasonable (but not excessive) padding. The only thing I continue to be concerned for are bumps that would break knobs, but...it is a soft-sided bag and not a hard-sided case. It is what it is and it does a good job.
