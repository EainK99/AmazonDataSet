I have to withdraw my my old review adjusted the pickups closer to the string and and set equal sound high E and low E and plugged  into my amp and low on behold this little setup works and sounds great tone control is nice. Sorry about the first review had not setup properly. I would highly recommend this setup for anyone electrifying their hollow body guitar
