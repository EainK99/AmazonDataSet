I own two pairs one for work and home. The sound is just right, clean, crisp and true. These compare to Dr. Dre Beats Studio $[$] price (My opinion) in terms of sound as I've done tests. RH5Ma are also the only ones in the store of 150+ headphones in the $150 Range that are Made In Japan - this is a big deal people because the whole store is filled with headphones that are Made in China/Taiwan/Thailand and other non sense, some of the top high priced good looking headphones MADE IN CHINA????? One thing I've learned over the years is that Japanese, German & American electronics are the most valued because of their quality. RH5Ma is a top notch offering from Yamaha. To Yamaha please stay true to your brand and keep offering people the Japanese products we so love and cherish.
