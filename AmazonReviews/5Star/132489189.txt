trumpet teacher says it has a great sound, and it's so easy to take on trips. my son is able to practice on vacations even when we travel. A small valve (the &#34;spit&#34; valve) came off at first, but an instrument repairman fixed it in 30 seconds. Otherwise, we have been very pleased, and of course people always ask if it is a REAL trumpet!
