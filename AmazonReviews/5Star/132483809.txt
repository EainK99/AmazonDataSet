Don't let the small size fool you - this is a great microphone. Exceptional sound and clarity especially for capturing acoustic guitar and piano. It has a wide frequency response and dynamic range, plus high sound pressure level capacity. Even for vocals it sounds great. For the price it is an astoundingly good value. Highly recommend.
