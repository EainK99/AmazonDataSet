Got lefty... Now 2, only 1 review per customer?<br />So I'll vouch for righty as well... This has got to be the best kept secret out there for this $!<br />#1 was flawless fed ex 2x boxed and bagged, except popped high e string; back of neck slightly coarse buff lightly with 00 steel wool and then perfect...( do this before you take the plastic off pickups... Magnetic?hello)<br />#2 impeccable but not flawless, also 2x box bagged, slight oxidation to laquer on back, and 1 micro nick on back... I mean micro... But # 2 had a killer neck with slightly darker tinge and luster, slight spray of some car wax fixed finish haze on body, now I can rash it up proper and have that guilt we all need.<br />Struck again by the killer fit of this overall and good detail like. wide flange strap buttons, mini tuners that rival Grover's, sweet black chrome end to end, and this neck is so correct,<br />I'm not gonna rave too much but wow! What do you want for your $, this guitar blows every other thing away less than 2x the price.<br />Even the knobs are set screw instead of cheap push on. For you floyd rose folks I say forget it, this can hold tune, out of box, and keep tuned nicely without any upgrade. It rocks !!! And fit and finish is perfect on both up front, I had to strain under bright light to find anything appearance wise, but this is usable gear not heirloom, I mean wow!!!!! The only thing separates from the big$ boys is a few high end parts you can easy upgrade to later, just as is it's no joke.
