I am so much more impressed than I expected to be with this amp. I've been through so, so many amps trying to get what this amp dishes out. I have one of the earlier models that is actually made in England, and let me tell you, this amp is worth every dime.<br /><br />The thing I love about it is that it sounds good at EVERY volume level. There's a 'sweet spot' on many, many amps. Some only sound good up to a certain volume, or only below it. This amp sounds good everywhere; I can't find a bad sound on it. Turn the bass up and you get a great jazz tone. Dial it back, crank up the mids and treble a bit (my fave setting) and you get some really, REALLY awesome rock sounds.<br /><br />I love the clean tone. I put all Tung Sol tubes in it, and it's got this really smooth but chimey clean tone that hits the spot. The distortion, though, is killer. It's kicked every high gain drive pedal off my board when I'm using this amp, because NONE of them sound as good. That drive channel is in another world, folks.<br /><br />Also, please don't make the mistake of replacing this speaker. This is the high end, made in England Celestion Greenback. Those are hard to find, and they're not cheap. Once it starts breaking in, you'll have a hard time finding anything that fits this amp better.<br /><br />Just a great, great sounding amp. I should also add that Laney's customer service is the best I have ever encountered, with any company. They've sent me replacement parts for this amp without even charging me shipping, all the way from the UK (I live in Oklahoma!), and the best part? I bought it used. I even told the Laney service folks that. I specified that the amp wasn't under warranty, and that I bought it used. When the handle started falling apart, they just mailed me a new one. When I broke the bracket holding in the EL84, they just sent me a new one. Incredible. Check them out, folks. You won't be disappointed!
