This is not a luxury accesory but a must have tool for guitar players. You get quality materials and craftmanship, beautiful design and attention to details, it's all there.<br /><br />The perfect companion for my Quilt Top Epiphone G-400 SG. It's a neck-heavy guitar so having an adequate strap is important. I'd recommend this item because of its quality and i would buy Levy's Leathers in the future for sure.
