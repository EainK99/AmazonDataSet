I  like it better then my Fender floor tuner. I can see the notes EADGBE on the box better then the Fender's small letters. has more led tune lights then Fender. seems to be well  made.  Only problem I have is that the D & B are in small letters should be in capitals letters like the rest of the notes. and it has no battery so has to be hooked up to power supply to work, so it's not portable. Other then that it's ( GREAT !! )
