Received at a discount for my honest review. I love this headphone like light, i used around my neck in bed to read, as a desk lamp. You can practically put anywhere you need some extra light. I took outside at night to take my dogs potty. Its perfect for everything i need very bendable and bright it has a touch button to turn on and off. It comes with rechargeable batteries and usb cord. Great product. I love it.......
