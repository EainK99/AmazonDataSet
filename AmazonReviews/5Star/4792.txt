Product works great.  We doubled them, so there are 4 light strips wrapped around 10 8x8 glass blocks which are installed in portable Bars used for local Fund raisers.  A group of guys do projects like this for fun and Funds for our local Hospital, Sierra Nevada Memorial Hospital Foundation, and other local organizations that also use the bars.  If you are interested I will send pictures.<br />Is it possible to get the light strips without the stickum on the back side?  Would they still be stable and adequately insulated?  We take them apart and put back together each time and are learning how and trying to make them look better and easier for others to do.<br /><br />Thank you,  Lance Amaral
