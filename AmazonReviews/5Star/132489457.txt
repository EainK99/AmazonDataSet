I have an Edge 09 Dean 4-String Electric Bass which is somewhat heavy. The stand holds it up pretty well. It's nice and sturdy. The bottom part that cradles the guitar is very loose. It moves around a lot. BUT not when you have the guitar mounted on. Plus it has this rubber band security lock thing which helps the guitar stay in place and not fall out. Overall it's perfect. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a simple guitar stand. It gets the job done right.
