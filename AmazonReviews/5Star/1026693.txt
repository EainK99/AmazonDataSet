The Pyle-Pro PSTND25 tripod speaker stands are quite nice for the price.  I will be using them for the support of two smallish Matrix B52 speakers and the matching mixer.  I don't use the system often, so I think they will stand up well for my needs.  The plastic fittings might be a problem for someone who uses them a lot.  But I would expect if that were the case, a higher price unit would be worth looking into.  The support tube is only one size on both ends, and should work well with any 1 3/8 mount.
