I PURCHASED A FRANKE HENNER MODEL VIOLIN FROM KENNEDY INSTRUMENTS ONLINE. I RECEIVED THE VIOLIN VERY QUICKLY AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE INSTRUMENT TO MY INSTRUCTOR. HE LOOKED IT OVER AND PLAYED IT AND SAID THE CASE ALONE WAS WORTH 75 TO 100 DOLLARS ALONE. HE SAID AFTER PLAYING THE VIOLIN THAT I HAD MADE A GREAT PURCHASE AND WAS SURPRIZED AT THE LOW PRICE.<br />THANKS KENNEDY INSTRUMENTS..
