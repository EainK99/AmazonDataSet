I ordered this to replace the one I bought in 1994. It's pretty much the same, just a different stand. This conga will take a beating more than you know. I made custom sticks that I hit this with and the head moves, but will not break. (if you have them[sticks] built correctly) I would add a photo here, but there is no upload for any. I play this weekly in my band/s and they work well. This one has the new slider mount and it's so easy to put on/take off. If your looking for less expensive, yet rugged, go for this one. You won't be dissapointed.
