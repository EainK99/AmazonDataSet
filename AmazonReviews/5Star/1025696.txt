Using this for transferring my vinyl collection to 96kHz-24bit high res files.  This was very easy to set up -- no issues getting my Windows 7 desktop to interface with it (i3 w/8GB RAM) although I have since gone ahead and downloaded the beta driver referenced in other reviews.  Using Adobe Audition to record/capture the sound and again no issues with the interface.  Ordered as a refurbed unit, and it came with all the original packaging/documentation although you have to download the windows driver before connecting.  Very pleased with this product so far.
