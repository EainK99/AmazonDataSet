Very nice guitar and very playable for the money.  Just as good, if not better, is the customer service and help from GearTree.  They responded to my initial questions about the guitar and follow up emails almost immediately.  Great business!!!<br /><br />I purchased the guitar and soft case together and was made quite a deal.  The case has changed colors to black and is very substantial in quality while fitting the guitar perfectly.  It looks better in this color.  Great handles and pockets for storing the extras and maybe sheet music or books, cds, etc.<br /><br />The guitar is about as easy playing and good looking as they come.  It even has an almost burnt wood scent (think fireplace) to let you know this is real cedar and cherry wood with the maple neck.  There's an excellent Godin / Seagull factory video on YouTube with a guided tour of their production of acoustics with Mr. Godin himself.  He discusses and shows what goes into the general building of the guitars:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I don't think you can get a better guitar for the money.  I really did the research before buying on this one and the consensus of reviews would also back up this opinion.  Thanks again to GearTree for working with me and being so helpful.<br /><br />J
