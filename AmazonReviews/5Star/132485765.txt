I came across by chance your customer review . . .<br />What's going on?<br />I see the subject concerning the instrument Manuel Rodriguez!<br />I think it is not fair to have such a mess for a guitar that nobody can say if is really made by MR, or even if is made by MR and there are some faults, should contact the manufacturer, Manuel Rodriguez.<br />Who can know under which conditions this guitar traveled ?<br />Even the largest and best distributors in the world are not immune to accidents, deformities, due to factors sometimes undetectable. It's the same for manufacturers.<br />Why instead of denigrating one of the founders of the school of string instruments in Spain and one of the largest manufacturers of world-renowned guitars, do not send him an e-mail asking for his assistance in relation to your problem.<br />Write him, describe your concerns !<br />It's the best solution and it's certain that MR will help you!<br />The strings positioning in absurd order is the first time I'm hearing such a thing . . .<br />All instruments to MR are coming out of assembly hall after a lot of checking points. So I'm not sure this guitar is a first-hand one . . .<br />And the history of guitars made in China, this is madness.<br />Is somebody ever been to China to see what they are capable? To see the wonders they perform? So why to despise them this way?<br />Instruments made by MD in China are made with materials coming directly from Spain and the production is monitored by highly talented Kraft-makers.<br />Despite the fact that we are in a context marked by a change in the over consumption which gives  a major challenge for brands, continuous MR meet people on the report Price and Quality. The acoustic performances of its various guitars are in line with this principle.<br />I hope you agree with me and contact directly MR to solve your issues and I'm strongly encouraging you to do it!<br />Thank you,<br />N Vallois
