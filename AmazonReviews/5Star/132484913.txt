What can you say about guitar strings.<br />If they stay in tune, last awhile and sound great what more could you ask for?<br />These do their job and do it admirably.<br />I use them on my ESP and Xaviere electrics.<br />I use D'Addario on my Jacksons because they came from the factory that way.<br />The D'Addario's are also excellent strings.<br />But if a set-up is ever required I may just switch to the S.I.T.'s because they are less expensive.<br />S.I.T. are great strings overall.<br />As good, if not better, than D'Addario's...
