The kids have never been happier!  Very easy to move around and hook up.  The microphone isn't as great as it could be but it's not terrible.  Can add a second mic and it hooks up to most phones/iPods/etc.  I wanted one that doesn't display the words ON the machine but a tv or laptop instead so this was absolutely perfect.
