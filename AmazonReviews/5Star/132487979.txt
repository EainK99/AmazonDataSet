I love these mallets as they sound quite nice on, not only on timpani but on symbols as well.<br />they are great general purpose mallets and I recommend them to anyone who are interested in playing percussion but don't have the money to buy sticks for every instrument they play.<br /><br />I am currently using these mallets for a musical production and like the title says, it does the job
