Item feels well made and was easy to install.<br />I'll definitely buy another if I install more lights.<br />I have been using this switch daily, off and on, with not problems.<br /><br />Usage: I installed a long line of LEDs around the base of my cabinets to light up my counter area, specifically around the coffee maker.<br /><br />The switch is small enough to stay hidden but big enough to easily flip on and off.<br />I highly recommend this switch to anyone buying the LED strips/cables.
