We needed an additional mic for a singing karaoke machine that only came with one microphone. It comes with a 3.5mm adaptor which comes in handy to plug the microphone into your stereo.  The cord is 13.1 ft, a lot longer than the microphone that came with our karaoke machine. It looks and feels great.
