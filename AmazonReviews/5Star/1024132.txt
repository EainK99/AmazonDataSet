Extremely nice product, very high quality skin with almost perfect cut....this is not made by some amateur, effort and research has been put into this.  Running on a Denon DP-15F through a Yamaha R-7, with B&W bookshelf speakers AND  Sennheiser HD580 headphones, both bass and treble response is just about dead on.  Using skin side up, as I feel it will resist dust impregnation better.   Would purchase again in a heartbeat.
