I was initially cautious when I found this product as it was 1/4 the price of similarly spec'd pedalboards from other companies. This board is amazing, and an incredible value. It makes me wonder why they aren't more popular! Solid construction, seems to be great quality.<br />I wish the lip on the board wasn't quite so high, but its only an issue where the cables leave the board, not a huge problem.
