It`s just what the jam doctor ordered! Flippin awesome! Been playing harp a long time and always wanted one of these, but i live way out here in the waste lands. So i never have seen one in the small town shops. Thanks to Amazon I finally have access to groovy stuff. The tone is great. fit and finish is great. the volume knob is mighty handy. A friend played one of the old ones back in the late 70s through a Fender Champ. This new Bullet does not have quite as much rasp as that old one but i think it sounds better on a clean Bassman.
