Truly universal. I ordered this for the [[ASIN:B004TE5HBU TASCAM DR-07MKII Portable Digital Recorder]], and it fits it like a glove both in the XY and AB mic configuration. To give you an idea if it will fit your device/mic, it very snuggly fits the bottom of a water bottle, covering it about the length of a finger. The draw string pulls in quite tightly, so It should work fine on most mics that size or smaller.  The wind reduction is average, fine for use in normal weather. I would expect some wind noise to get through on gusty days.  For me, there's only two drawbacks: I wish there was a black color option to better match my equipment, and something about this dead cat unduly attracts my live cat's attention, I have to stop her from giving it mouth-to-mouth. As another reviewer said, the way it's folded into the box does leave a noticeable crease on the hairs, but I expect it to straighten with time. I should note I ordered this on Amazon Japan, which had it at a much more competitive price. Were I not in Japan, I'd likely have looked for an off-brand cheap windscreen.
