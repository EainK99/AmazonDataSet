I purchased this for my daughter who plays the clarinet. She rented the alto sax from her school to try it out. After hearing how well she picked up the sax, the decision was made that she needed one of her own. Of course she being a beginner, we were looking at purchasing a sax on the more affordable end. After looking at numerous saxophones and reading many reviews, I am so glad I came across this one. You really can't go wrong with the price when it comes to the quality of the instrument, the carrying case, cork grease, etc. This saxophone is truly beautiful!<br /><br />As advised by others who have purchased this, I changed out the mouth piece with a better one and bought her high quality reeds to use. According to my daughter, this made a big difference in the sound and feel. She also said the strap wasn't very good and caused her a lot of discomfort, so I replaced the strap with a much better one as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great instrument with a great price for those who are beginners.
