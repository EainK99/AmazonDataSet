JJ tubes have a good reputation for quality, and it is well deserved. I used these to replace JJ KT77s in a Mesa/Boogie Stereo 50 poweramp, and I couldn't be happier. The KT&&s have a ratty, higher gain, higher distortion sound, better suited for hard rock, metal, etc. Even using an SMS preamp and a Hermida Zendrive, I couldn't take the edge off. Installing the 6l6GC tubes gave my rack the smooth, round glassiness I was looking for, with only a minimal drop in output.<br /><br />Obviously, time will tell whether they hold up to use, but the JJ reputation for solid, durable construction leaves me without any worries.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!
