Amazing headphones, while out of the box they did seem a little dull and bass focused, I soon adjusted and they are honestly the best sounding headphones I have had the pleasure of listening to. Once I used these headphones I found it hard to return to my old earphones and headphones as they just didn't sound as pleasant as these did. Truly amazing, would recommend to people wanting to get amazing sound quality
