Chose these speakers after seeing them rated highly online and have been happy with them. They get plenty loud for a room and could provide an apartment with sound. High-end is clear, mids are clear, and mid-bass is solid. Good sound, good price, would get them again. They are on the large side for desktop speakers, but smaller than typical bookshelf speakers.<br /><br />Minor downsides: there is a faint hum when the source is disconnected or off (I use an iPod with them) and they &#34;pop&#34; rather loudly when turned off (volume setting doesn't matter). So they might not be good for use on a nightstand next to your bed. 10 feet away you can't hear it and any background sound will cover it. They don't do as well with booming bass, just don't have the mass for it. That's the downside of 2.0 speakers and you can't get everything for $150. The back of the left speaker gets warm during use (amps are in there) but hasn't gotten hot enough to be an issue.<br /><br />I recommend them.
