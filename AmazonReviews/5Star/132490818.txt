These bass traps are a very good option if you have a tight budget and you still need to control the low frequency waves bouncing in your space. These bass traps worked great and also the installation was very simple. I used the Auralex TTPro Tubetak Pro Liquid Adhesive to glue the bass traps on the walls. As a note I used 4 tubetaks to install the 8 bass traps that came with the kit
