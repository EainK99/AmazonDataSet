I needed a small lavalier type mic for an interview and an interview type scene for something I'm working on. This mic provide excellent sound and was easy to hide when filming. I recommend trying this if you're just getting started and do not have a huge budget to work with.  The one negative I had with this mic is that if you rub an area near it on the person it completely pics up that audio so be careful.
