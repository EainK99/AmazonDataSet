I have to admit all the negative reviews about Windows 7 driver issues had me worried when I bought the Blackjack in early Sept 2013.  I took a chance that Mackie knows what they're doing and I was rewarded.  My unit works flawlessly on my Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit HP PC running Adobe Audition.  I downloaded and installed the Windows drivers from the Mackie Onyx Blackjack site with no issues, carefully following the accompanying instructions for installation.  I am not an audio guru, but have spent some time in voice-over studios.  The Blackjack is a winner in my book - robust, performs as it should and costs much less than the competition.  Glad I bought it!
