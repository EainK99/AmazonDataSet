I looked at several other action gauges as well as the FretGuru2 prior to purchase. I chose the FretGuru2 thinking the main benefit I would have from it would be from the accuracy of the action function. The first use I gave it was on a 1960’s era Gibson Dove. I had examined the Dove earlier and was set to file the fret slots for a lower Nut action on the low E as it measured too high with the feeler gauge. When I used the FretGuru2 Nut Slot Height function I discovered that the slotting was correct. I had not noticed that the new E string I had installed was damaged at the small length contained inside the slot and was causing a too high condition. Saved me the cost of a Nut Repair immediately!
