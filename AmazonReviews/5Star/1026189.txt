As a jazz hobbyist, this is perfect for me. I use only the upper pickup and run it through a Roland amp. It produces a very mellow tone with finger picking.<br />The action was set just as I would have it out of the box. Intonation is excellent. Mechanically, I see no problems with it.<br />Note: I comes with very light strings - 9 thru x. This is not good for a mellow jazz sound. I replaced the strings with [[ASIN:B00IZCSX9U D'Addario NYXL1046 Nickel Plated Electric Guitar Strings, Light]] and I'm extremely satisfied with the tone.<br />I'm a 50 plus year player and have had my fingers on nearly everything (in the way of guitars of course) over the years. This feels as good to me as the Gibsons and Fenders I owned in the sixties.
