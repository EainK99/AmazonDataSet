The BBE Windowpane Fuzz is quite a nice silicon fuzz pedal for the price. I like it. Of course, germanium fuzzes sound better but they are more expensive and rather finicky. A silicon fuzz is more reliable. The main thing about a fuzz box is knowing how to use it properly. You turn the fuzz control all the way up and control it with your guitar's volume knob. Depending on your guitar, you will get the best lead tone at 9 - 9 1/2 on the volume knob. Cut it back just a touch to clean it up, yet still distort. The usable range on a fuzz is generally between 8 and 9 1/2 on your guitar volume. For the best sound, run it into an amp that is already overdriven somewhat. That's how JIMI got his sound! Or, use the fuzz in conjunction with an overdrive box. I play my Telecaster through a Blackstar ID Core 10 watt amp and an Eleca overdrive. Very cheap stuff. I run the fuzz into the overdrive before the amp, set my guitar volume at about 9 and I'll tell you what - it sings! A fuzz is a very simple device, and you need to know how to use it. Too many players buy one, immediately decide it's crap and get rid of it. They don't realize that they threw away an amazing tool for achieving massive guitar tone. Experiment with it and you'll be rewarded.
