I own two of these controls.  They're outstanding.  Solidly constructed with an unobtrusive design.  Better yet they work as advertised.  My only wish is that TC Electronic would consider extending the cable length between the level pilot knob and the xlr connectors.  For my setup that would be a nice touch.  Outside of that very small issue I've got nothing buy high praise for this unit.
