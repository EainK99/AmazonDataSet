this is my favorite guitar that I own. I love the color, the weight and the sound. Could not get this sent to me in Iraq so I had to wait until I got back home to play it. Well worth the wait. This &#34;snakeskin&#34; finish is awesome!! Great &#34;action&#34; on it also. I was kind of thinking it might be a little cheap but that was only the price!!!!
