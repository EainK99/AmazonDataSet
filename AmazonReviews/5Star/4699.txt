Easy to use.  The portability is great.  Interface allows for basic track editing with ease.  The EQs work better than you'd think.  The reverb ain't half bad either.  The phantom power is nice. Downloading the data to computer for DAW work later is simple as can be.<br /><br /> I don't just use it as a sketch pad for ideas, but as my go-to recorder for guitars, electric and acoustic.  This machine has a nice little secondary use as well.  It's a really nice simple, portable two channel mixer.  Works well for messing around with a drum machine and synthesizer, or an ipod or sampler and a digital piano.<br /><br />I do not recommend the AC adapter, as that ties the 8-track down to one spot and makes it less likely you'll use it as an on-the-go recording buddy.  The battery life may be limited to around 3 hours, but you can grab an 8 pack of 2700-2900 rechargeable AAs for $15 and then you're pretty much set for life.
