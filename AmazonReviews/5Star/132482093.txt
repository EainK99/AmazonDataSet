I recently bought this to pair up with a new Orange TH100 head and it is a match made in heavood en.  Until the PPC412A arrived I was putting the head through an old Marshall 1960B which was pretty sweet but the Orange 4x12 takes it to another level.  Beautiful cleans but when you dirty it up this thing really rocks and projects.  I've found that the sound fills the room and I have turned the amp down as the sound is so good.
