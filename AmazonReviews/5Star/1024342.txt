This little egg shaker is adorable. It is perfect for toddlers. The size is just right for them to grab with their little hands. The sound it makes is soothing. My 9 month hold loves it. She will shake it for several minutes and we all know that their attention span is super small at this age, so anything holding their attention for a few minutes is excellent. I also love the way it is made. You do not have to worry about your little one being able to choke on it which is a huge relief. It is made of solid birch wood and the finish is non-toxic. It also has a lifetime guarantee which is nice. I feel that this will be a toy my little one will love for many years!  I received this product at a reduced rate for my honest, unbiased opinion.
