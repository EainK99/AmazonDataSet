This is a quality throne. While it's true that there is no quick adjustment to height one of the complaints I had with past thrones is the quick adjust on the height broke or stripped and so I was stuck with the lowest setting. In fact with one throne I had a radiator clamp to keep it at playable height.<br /><br />That problem won't happen with this one! I like it, very durable and very sturdy!
