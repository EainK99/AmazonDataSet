I received my violin on Tuesday, September 17. I'm writing this review after owning and playing it for one week now. This has been my experience with the violin so far.<br /><br />The day I received the violin, I was unable to set it up because the tailcord that holds the tailpiece to the end pin of the violin kept loosening and eventually one of the little nuts that grip on to the tailcord to hold the tailpiece together came off. I found out on youtube that you can burn the end pieces of the tailcord so that the nut can get a good grip and keep it from coming off. I had to do that three times because every time I would set it up and tune it, the tailcord would snap after a couple hours of practicing. Finally the last time I did it, I burned the end piece a little further down before tightening the nut on the tailcord, my idea was that this would make it harder for the nut to slip, and since then the violin has stayed in tune and had no problems practicing.<br /><br />Why 5 stars then? I'm giving this violin a high rating because thanks to the seller, SocalDailyDeals, I was able to not give up on this violin and it has been a great tool to learn a new skill. After having problems with the tailpiece of my violin, I contact them and they gave me the option to return it, exchange it, or have a new tailpiece sent to me. I was happy with the overall quality of the violin and did not want to return it if I could get it working and I asked them to send me the new tailpiece. I also requested for them to send me a new bridge because I had accidentally broken off a piece on the one it came with.<br /><br />However, before the tailpiece arrived, my quick fix of burning the tailcord turned out to work and even now I'm still using the same tailpiece it came with and every morning when I wake up, my violin is still nicely set up and tuned. With the tailpiece, they also sent me a new set of strings, another end button pin for the violin and the new bridge I requested!<br /><br />The violin has been playing nicely, I have had fun practicing on it and I'm incredibly happy that for $40 that I spent, I now have the opportunity to learn a new instrument.<br /><br />The strings on the violin are amazing. This was a shock for me because I wasn't expecting decent strings, and I purchased the D'Addario Prelude strings and after trying both the stock strings and the D'Addario, I was surprise that there wasn't enough difference to say one was better than the other. The strings ring out nice and sound beautiful.<br /><br />I had similar doubts about the rosin it would come with and I also ordered another rosin, SuperSensitive ligh rosin, and again like the strings, both are of similar quality.<br /><br />The bow is nicely curved how I have been reading on violin guides that a bow needs to be. The hairs can be tighten and loosen no problem and make the strings play great.<br /><br />The digital tuner works just like any other chromatic digital tuner. It's as accurate as the Snark tuners I own. Clamp it on, pluck a string, tighten or loosen it to tune it. Simple.<br /><br />The case is nice and sturdy, it will be enough to safely carry your violin around. Has little compartment for your rosin, tuner and anything else you would like to bring. Has two clips that can hold two separate bows and a medium size compartment bag on the outside for books or strings.<br /><br />You don't need to go spend $200+ on your first violin to begin learning. This will be more than enough to start you off!he violin has been playing nicely, I have had fun practicing on it and I'm incredibly happy that for $40 that I spent, I now have the opportunity to learn a new instrument.<br /><br />The strings on the violin are amazing.
