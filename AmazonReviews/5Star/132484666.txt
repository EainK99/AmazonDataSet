I have been searching and researching these for several months. Yes, i compared it to the Zoom and im so glad that i went with the Tascam.<br />Super user friendly.<br />Superior sound.<br />Unlike the light and flimsy zoom, the tascam is soild and has the appropriate weight to it.<br /><br />NOTE: these are not meant for hand held recording. These condenser mics are super sensitive. I purchased the mini tripod and mic stand adapter for my recording purposes.<br /><br />This mighty little device does not disappoint.<br /><br />(As others have stated, i have not had an issue with battery life. I use this on a weekly basis for 3 months now and still have the original batteries in. I do not remove them.)
