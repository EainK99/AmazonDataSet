For 60 bucks, this violin is great! I've been wanting to learn to play for a while, but I thought it would take me pulling 200 dollars out of my pocket for a violin, and so I kept putting off learning it because other more important things than learning the violin came up. But when I found this on amazon, I bought it right away! Its so cheap of a price but doesn't sound bad at all. I'm sure a pricy violin would sound better, but thats with any instrument. This is a great deal.
