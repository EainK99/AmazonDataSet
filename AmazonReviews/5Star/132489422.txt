Purchased in February after another bag I purchased fell apart. Not only did the bag last through the school year but we have started another year and it's in great shape. It has straps like a back pack or can be carried on the shoulder or by hand. The pockets are roomy. It cost a little more but the quality of this bag makes it worth it.
