Great expectations of the product had not disappointed me, the finish is incredible, elegant and high quality as a high gamma bass should be, the sound is incredible, strong, with a great cleaning, easy to play, very smooth.<br /><br />I recommend either white or black (mine is white). A good bass with an excellent price. And high gamma.
