The Sennheiser HD380 headphones are some of the best I've ever owned.  Great step up from an old set of Sennheiser HD280 headphones, huge difference in sound.  I compared both the Shure SRH840 and the Sennheiser HD380.  Playing various types of Rock, Metal, R&B, both are very, very close sound quality, almost identical.  However, after playing several bass heavy songs (try Bass Test - Feel The BASS!) seems the Sennheiser's bass is deeper, more like a subwoofer, although supposedly this is electronically enhanced.  Fit wise, the Shure's fit nicely and don't put too much pressure on your head but they sit directly on your ears.  The Sennheiser's fit tighter, but the cans are oval shaped and larger, which keeps them off your ears a little better.  Build wise, the Shure's seem more solid, the Sennheiser's are cheaper feeling.    Shure SRH840 - Great sound, smooth accurate bass, CLEANER SOUND, nice fit, solid build    Sennheiser HD380 - Great sound, ENHANCED BASS, tighter fit, larger cans, less solid build
