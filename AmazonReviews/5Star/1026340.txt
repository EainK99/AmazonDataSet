Looking for an inexpensive microphone simply to work with Windows 10 and Cortana. This successfully satisfies this needs. I was able to plug it in and set up Cortana with ease. I wanted something that I could easily clip somewhere and hide it instead of having a desktop microphone or buy a webcam. Perfect price and perfect for what I need it for!
