There are no better headphones in this price range....At least for me.<br />Great sound.<br />Gread feel.<br />Detachable cables.<br /><br />Only thing that I don't like is the absence of 1, 2m cable that goes only with m50x, but you can get it separately.<br /><br />I use them for monitoring, listening music on mu dap, computer and tab....and they do a grat job for that.
