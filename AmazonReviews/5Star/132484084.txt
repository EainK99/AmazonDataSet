I was a first time mandolin buyer and prefer to purchase a used, better quality unit that would serve my needs and still retain some retail value.<br /><br />After reading many ideas at the mandolin cafe, I settled upon the highly recommended Kentucky 505, A style mandolin.<br /><br />I bought it used for about half of what a new one would cost and it arrived already setup.<br /><br />The recommendations said Kentucky makes 2 levels of mandolins, the basic level and the better level. This is the bottom of the upper level of mandolins.<br /><br />It is touted as having a hand carved, solid wood top as opposed to other lower models that just had a solid wood top.<br /><br />It is a nicely made instrument with decent craftsmanship.<br /><br />After opening the box, I had to tune the strings to proper pitch by using a chromatic tuner I'd borrowed from my guitar case. As I tuned each string to pitch I could hear the sound get much louder as the tuner indicated the string was now at proper pitch. That usually indicates you have hit harmonic resonance with that piece of wood. The sound waves are reinforcing themselves rather than partially cancelling themselves out. Resonance in this level of instrument was not anticipated; in an instrument several times this price, yes, but not at this price point.<br /><br />I put a strap on it, opened the Mandolin for Dummies book, and was soon strumming chords to songs just like I'd done to the guitar. :-)
