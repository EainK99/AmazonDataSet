I've had these for half a year or more now. They work great! I carry them in my pack everyday which gets a bit of a tough time on it, but have not had any breaks or wire tearing. They still have the same sound as if I just bought them. I did not realize how long the cord actually was until I got it but with the clip/wrap it works great and stays the length I need! (I would not suggest these for parkour or skaters. I dabbled in both and have seen some of my friends with similar, but their wires were shorter.) I would definitely buy these again especially for the price. You are getting a great deal. If I had to buy some again it'd be these.
