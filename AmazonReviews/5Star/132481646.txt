The unit is great, but Amazons Info is bad.<br /><br />Product: Techno Strobe(TM) 2000S by Chauvet<br /><br />Problem:  The listed &#34;Features&#34; are incorrect or incomplete.<br />Detail:<br />Included in the product Features is the statement &#34;Chase via optional controller; DMX converter available.&#34;  There is no other information about  -DMX converter available-  no link, no item name, etc.  I contacted the manufacturer of the product, Chauvet and asked about the controller for this strobe.  They replied:<br /><br />&#34;We do not sell a DMX converter for this fixture. I am not sure if this is something that Amazon offers that is made by another manufacture. The only thing that would be considered close that we carry is a DMX controller that has a mono ¼ inch output that will allow you to control the ST2000S.&#34;<br /><br />Question: Does anyone know what Amazon is talking about insofar as this DMX converter goes?  Is this a third party item? If so what is the item name/link?
