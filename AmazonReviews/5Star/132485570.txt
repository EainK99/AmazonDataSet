I own 10 guitars and have built quite a few. I've played for over 30 years. Bought this for my daughter as her \\"first\\" guitar. Crazy-nice guitar: I love the sound, the look, the playability - it's all there. I keep asking myself why spend $2500 on a Custom Shop Fender?! Well, I know the answer to that but still, very little separates this guitar from one 10X the price. The neck (and from a playability standpoint it's 99% neck) is way nice: smooth, straight, fast and couldn't find any type of abnormality.<br /><br />Piece of advice: Do NOT buy a satin finish neck - ever - buy a gloss-finish neck. Satin gets dirty and slow after 50 hours of playing.<br /><br />So, Daughter's stoked, Dad's stoked (that I get to play it while she's not around).<br /><br />If this is near your price range, you'll be very please with this.
