This is perhaps the best all purpose capo out there. So easy on and off. I use it with my electric guitars. Works fine for most acoustics too, though my main guitar is set up with high action and medium gauge strings--harder to play, but I do it for the great tone I get. (I use a Paige for that guitar--am older Gibson J200). Anyway the G7th allows for some buzz for that instrument. Still, very few players should have that problem. It's really a great capo.
