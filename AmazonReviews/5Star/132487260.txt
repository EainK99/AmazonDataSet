Being more of a guitar player just learning how to frail a 5-string banjo, the original solid wood insert bridge that came on my lower-class banjo didnt last very long. the 5th string insert had wore out, and the 5th string would slide over into the 4th string slot, and kill out the sound totally.<br /><br />Since replacing it with this cheap bone insert bridge, I been popping that 5th string relentlessly and haven't noticed any signs of wear on the bridge; and the strings all seem to stay in place without any issues.<br /><br />This seller delivered the item/s in warp speed or without any troubles; and I simply can't say enough good about the seller!! Would highly recommend and I plan to use them again, without hesitation and/or limitation.
