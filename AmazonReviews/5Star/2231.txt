I have tried a lot of different headphones.  My main ones for years were Beyerdynamic DT770s.  I borrowed three sets of Ultrasones (ranging in price from $700-$1500) from a friend.  These made me realize how much high end definition was missing in my DT770s.  At the same time, the mids sounds horribly scooped in the Ultrasones.  The Focal Spirit Professional headphones are giving me the best of both worlds.  Simply put, they sound balanced from top to bottom.  The detail is there.  And I have to say the transient response is better than any other headphones I've heard.  They're also incredibly efficient.  I let my friend who lent me the Ultrasones check out the Focals, and he, within a very short duration of listening to them, decided he needed a pair.<br /><br />The only downside is they're not the most comfortable headphones to wear for extended periods of time.  I guess I was spoiled in that regard with my DT770s.<br /><br />Anyway, these are winners for me.
