I've been using this case every week for 2 months now and it holds up just fine. I must have the new version because I don't see any way that the needles would hit each other if you had the case loaded with 4. One side of the case holds 2 and the opposite side of the case holds the other 2. I can't believe they messed this up on the first version.<br /><br />The retention clip things on the inside are really strong and I don't ever have to worry about my expensive needles rattling around (I used to use a padded eye glass case so this is a huge step up). The case also seems waterproof but I don't plan on going swimming with my DJ gear anytime soon. Overall it is really durable and perfect for throwing into a DJ bag/ backpack.<br /><br />If you use the Technics headshells and Shure needles this is what you need. Get it.
