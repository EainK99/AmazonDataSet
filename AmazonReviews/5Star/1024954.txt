I've tried most of the other strings out there, and all of the ones near this price, but none of them sound nearly as good as these Super Nylguts. I have some of the regular Nylguts that were bright and noisy and never broke in (could have been a fluke?). But I've had two sets of these super nylguts and have no complaints.<br />They sound to bright for the first week, and they need frequent tuning. Then they relax and sound so sweet, clear and much louder than any other strings. My soprano is as loud as any tenor strung with nylon strings. They look good, kind of pearlescent. And they have great feel, tight and slippery, easy to play. And if the set on my Concert Pineapple are any indication, they last a very long time. My ukes are happy, and so am I.
