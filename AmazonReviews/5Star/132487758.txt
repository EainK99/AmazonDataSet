I use my Mbrace with a low profile microphone stand and it supports the weight of my guitar so that I can sit in front of my guitar and play. My guitar is an electric classical guitar, which I recently got because of health problems.  The electric guitar requires much less finger pressure than regular classical guitars, but it is too heavy for me to hold. Mbrace holds my guitar for me while I play.
