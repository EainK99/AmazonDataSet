I can't say enough about this mic! I used it to produce a puppet production as well as several of my friends'music.  It sounds great for vocals, acoustic guitar, foley work, everything! And it is SUPER low noise. Warm, even tone and true depth to the sound. You need a phantom power source. Mine came with an awesome shock mount too!
