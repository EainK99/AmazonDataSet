Great bundle! I was trying to figure out what the catch was because this bundle is basically the same price as just the headphones. But there is no catch, everything was in the retail packaging and it all worked fine. As for the headphones, they are top notch but I only have one complaint about them; and that is that after a long period of wearing them it will start to hurt above your ear if you wear glasses. But the sound is amazing and the amplifier only makes it better especially if you prefer a little more bass.
