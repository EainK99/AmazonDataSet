I bought this mat to reduce static mainly.  I thought if it sounded better that would be an added bonus.  Well I was surprised to find the sound really is much better with this mat in place.  Better instrument separation and bigger bass.  Very airy and easy to listen to.  I would highly recommend this mat as an upgrade for your TT.  I have a Music Hall MMF 2.2 and I am pleased to say this is easily the best upgrade I have made to it yet.  Including the Grado Gold 1 cart I bought.  Everything is better with this mat.  And did I mention it reduces my static problems?  Less noise!!  No clicks or pops.  Still some surface noise, but nothing from static.  Anyways, I bought  Souther Clever Clamp at the same time and have been trying the mat w/ and w/out the clamp.  I think I prefer it without the clamp.  It seems less fatiguing and a better listen.  The bass is somewhat reduced with the clamp.  Instrument separation is not as good with it in place.  So I wouldn't recommend using that clamp with the mat.  It says on the box it is ok to use a clamp, but is not ideal.  That is paraphrasing.  In other words, it won't hurt anything but that is not how the mat was designed to work.  In short, this is a great deal at fifty bucks, which is what I paid for it.  I did buy it somewhere else, but that was only because I wanted it with the clamp I mentioned and they don't sell it here on Amazon.
