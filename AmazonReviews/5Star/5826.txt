Ordered one to add some lighting to the  inside of an enclosed car trailer.  One end of the string has a pair of wire (red & black) about 2&#34; long to connect the 12 volts to.  The other end of the string has a short cable about 4&#34; long with a DC connector on it.  I test the string at 12 volts and found it only draws 1 amp and not the 2 amps as listed in the description so it only draws 12 watts and not 24 watts.  While testing the lights in the trailer I found that 1 LED would flicker on and off.  Apparently a poor solder connection inside.<br />The string is completely encased is a clear rubber to fully protect the string from any water intrusion.<br />Overall very happy with it and ordered a second string for additional lighting.
