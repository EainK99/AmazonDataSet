Not much to review here. A simple strap to hold my ukulele. That work just fine. I do have a tip though for those of you who are worried about the screw coming loose, after a while. After carefully attaching the mounting screw. Take it apart and put a small drop of the 5 minute epoxy on the screw threads then reattach the screw to the uke.
