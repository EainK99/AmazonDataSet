I wish I'd had this machine 40 years ago. I've never had so much fun getting my songs recorded. It's brilliant how one can lay down tracks and play along with them. I've never had such a good band as the one I'm recording ha ha! Worth every penny or should I say dollar. Could praise it for the next hour but too busy recording! must get on. Anyone who reads this and enjoys making their own music should rush out and buy a Tascam DP 24. It's brilliant. Get one and have fun. All the best,  Mal
