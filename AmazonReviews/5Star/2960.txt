What an assortment of picks!  I've tried most of them...have a couple of favorites of course.<br /><br />And, thanks to an email from the company, I now know how to easily open the Tin.  Yeah, as crazy as it sounds<br />I struggled to claw open the cover not realizing that all I had to do was press down on the center of the cover and<br />pull it off.  Thanks for the help Anthony Scott!<br /><br />Almost didn't buy them because of the price, but now that I've seen and used them I think it's reasonable.
