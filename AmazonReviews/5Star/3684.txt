Even though I use a 20, I really lay into it because I've played more heavier stuff years ago. Even with the front head on, this gives my a much thuddier sound than say a pinstripe. Tune it low, lower pitched thud. Higher, higher pitched thud. The one constant is the thud. Perfect bass drum sound imho. Trust me on this one. I've  used every bass head on the market.
