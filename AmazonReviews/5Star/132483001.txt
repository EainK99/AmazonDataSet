Great little ukulele and so much fun to play. I changed the strings as others recommended and it definitely improved the sound and helps it to stay in tune. There were a few chips in the paint near the fretboard, but nothing too bad. I would wholeheartedly recommend this ukulele to anyone wanting to learn how to play.<br /><br />..and I mean, seriously, how cute is that little dolphin?
