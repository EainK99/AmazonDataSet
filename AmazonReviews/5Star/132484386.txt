This is the microphone I always wanted, but wasn't able to afford until now. I was talked into buying another microphone before I bought this one a while back that was less expensive, and was told it was better than the Super 55. It was an alright mic, but I was just not happy with it. I sold it and finally bought the microphone that fits my style. I love it! Heavy, sounds fantastic, and that classy smooth look and feel. An absolutely beautiful microphone that is worth the money in looks AND sound..
