These are the best mics ever. They are VERY durable (I drop them on the stage often to prove to people they are; but I wouldn't keep doing that too often) They offer self tuning channels that either mic can use and show you the channel by the colour of the LED ring at the bottom, they get a very clean long range sound without skipping or static, they show you the amount of battery life on the mic, which averages 8-12 hours on a single charge, and yes they are rechargable best of all. These are a bit pricey, but you do get what you pay for with these, and they ARE worth it.
