I have to say I think I am a bit cookie when it came to getting this set up.  I thought it didn't work with the optical audio cable that was included.  I just couldn't get it to work.  Then I asked some questions and realized that I needed to remove the little plastic covers on the tips of the cable before the cable would do its job.  I am hard of hearing so I need headphones so I don't blast my husband out of the room because I cannot hear.  The TV didn't have audio out RCA jacks so I used this to hook up my headphones without putting the jack into the headphone jack making it so that only I could hear the TV.  Now my husband can have the volume where he needs it and I can turn my headphones up to hear.  This is a very honest review of this product even though I received a discount for my opinion.
