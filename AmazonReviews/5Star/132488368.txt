My new Audio-Technica turntable did not sound as powerful as expected.  With the addition of this preamplifier, the improvement was amazing.  The setup was very easy (and I am a 66 year old woman with no technical expertise).  I connected the RCA plugs into one of the empty outlets for a  DVR/VCR2 on my Yamaha receiver, and I plugged the electrical cord into a switched outlet on the receiver.  The unit turns off when the receiver is off.  However, the blue light was extremely bright, but  we covered it with electrical tape, and it is no longer noticeable.  The output adjustment is easy and make a wonderful difference in the sound.  I love listening to vinyl records again.
