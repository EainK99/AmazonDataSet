Great headset. Ordered 2 of these and have now been using them for 2 years (I know...a late review). Absolutely great frequency response that has yielded pretty good quality mixes. Would not use them to mix a demo, but great for scratch tracks and rough song ideas. Very comfortable to wear for prolonged period of time. Highly recommend them!
