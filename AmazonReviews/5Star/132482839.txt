They generally last me a couple of months until finally the high E snaps.  At that point, they are so corroded and dull-toned I'd throw on another fresh one of these sets!  This is not a &#34;knock&#34; against these strings at all.  You'll pay a great price for these strings and enjoy them for a long time.  I usually place another order for one (or two) of these packs when I feel my current set may be getting to the end of their life.  By the way, I invest about 4-6 hours a week playing the guitar loaded with these strings.
