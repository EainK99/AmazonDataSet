I purchased one of the Neotech Jammin Straps for my Custom Les Paul. I love it. The color matches my guitar and it's very comfortable and easily adjusted. I usually prefer leather straps and have them on my other Les Paul and my ES-335, but the Neotech are really nice since they come in different colors. I also put one on a custom Les Paul I built for one of my students and he really likes it. I highly recommend them!
