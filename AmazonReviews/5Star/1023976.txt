I purchased this head for a 1967 Ludwig Acrolite Snare that I was reconditioning. Being a thinner head, it is more sensitive which brings out more tone and allows a longer sustain, which really lets this vintage drum sing. I paired it with an Evans Strata 1000 Concert head and Puresound Pro Brass snare wires. The combination achieves a nice warm tone, with a bright buzz and ample sustain. As with all Evans Level 360 heads, slapping it on and tuning it was a breeze.
