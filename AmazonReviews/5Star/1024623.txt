Excellent product.  I’ve used it to convert cassette tapes using an old JVC cassette deck and a boom box with a cassette player with my Macbook Air.  The Audacity software that accompanied the recorder was easy to use, but in comes on a CD-ROM.  You may be able to find it online, but I couldn’t see it at the EZ Cap website.  The .mp3 files created were of decent quality.  For the price, I couldn’t be more pleased.
