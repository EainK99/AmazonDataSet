first of all, I bought the maple one, not the walnut. To my understanding they are both about the same. I learned 3 songs the first night that I had it, Although, I do have some complaints. It would have been better with machine tuners. It is hard to fret on real high notes, because you have to push real hard to make it resonate right. The frets are hard to see. If the frets were a bit taller and a little darker, it would be better. This is the first instrument that I have been able to pick up how to play a song quickly. This did come with a small how-to booklet with 3 songs, a fret board map, and a few basic chords. It also had a tuning wrench and a pick.I hope this review helps.
