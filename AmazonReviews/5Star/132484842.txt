uh, my title pretty much said everything you need to know. good price on amazon, fast shipping for prime. Kind of funny that the keychain black light I bought first at the pet store was probably 9 or 10 bucks and not worth it at all. To see pet pee I recommend this light which is long and bright. You will want an extension cord to use this light however - the built in cord is short.
