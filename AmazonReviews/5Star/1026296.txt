This is a very solid and well-made stand.  I bought it to replace my aging Hamilton trombone stand.  The K&M can be adjusted to be a little higher than the Hamilton, which is nice for gigs where I'm standing most of the time.  The Hamilton &#34;bone sock&#34; fits it like a glove.  Or, well, a sock.  Definitely worth the money to me.
