My Taylor Big Baby had these strings from the factory, and I waited about a year to replace them.  The new strings made my guitar sound brighter and crisper so I'll probably try to replace my strings 3 or 4 times per year from now on.  Apparently, as strings age (by corrosion, picking up grime from skin oils, etc.) the sound quality starts to degrade.  Also, you need more tension to get the same tuning on old strings, and that can reportedly cause damage to the neck.
