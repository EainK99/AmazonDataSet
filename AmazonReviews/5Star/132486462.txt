First let me say I am a musician not a sound engineer. I had originally planned on investing a much larger sum of cash into a home recording rig, that would have included mics, preamps ,interfaces the whole works, but i ultimately decided to go with the apogee mic and jam. Why?  Because These tools are so user friendly that they put far less barriers between you and creating quality sounding recordings. Had i went the alternative route I would have likely invested much more time in learning new software and settings for the equipment before I got anything of value out. With these tools I plugged and played and had a decent sounding recording the first day. Will you get professional studio quality recording? Maybe not,but it will be damn close for a fraction of the price and will allow you to focus more on what is really important......the music.
