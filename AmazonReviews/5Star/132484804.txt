I was a little nervous ordering this set but was pleasantly surprised by the craftsmanship. I kind of feel bad for paying so little for it. All three reeds worked great out of the box and the different sizes made for different tones. I've been playing the highland pipes for almost 10 years, so setting up reeds was no biggie, but I'd highly recommend watching some of the how-to videos on youtube for getting the reeds ready to play and for technique. My only concern was the packaging it came in, but all was ok on arrival. Definitely a happy customer!
