I had seen other reviews regarding the quality, however having worked in on-stage audio productions and TV/Film production in college, I know that audio is critical to any video work.  Having said that it is also necessary that the buyer understand the differences in audio signals/levels.  Mic level vs line level.  Balanced vs unbalanced.  Low impedance vs high impedance vs speaker impedance.  It is easy to overdrive a circuit as well as providing too low a signal and try to amplify it when there is nothing there.  Done right, this unit has what is needed to capture audio, record it, send it to a camera, and even monitoring at the same time.  It is also great to mount it on a tripod and mount the camera on top to make it easy to access when there is a small film crew and the cinematographer is also the sound tech.  The only issue which is not a huge deal is the battery life, which could be eliminated with the use of an AC adapter or use of the USB cord into a 12v plug into a portable 12v battery. I also have a DR40 which works just fine if you need a bit more portability, but you will need to either construct a splitter to split the headphone signal to allow the use of headphones and to provide a mic level signal if you plan on feeding the camera direct, else just monitor and record into the DR40 and sync it on the video editor.
