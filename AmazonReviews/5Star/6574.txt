Fantastic stand for the Blue Yeti microphone! This is my first microphone stand like this, and it is way better than what I was expecting. It's very high quality. I've had the stand for a few months now, and it's been great. Although, just yesterday, I tightened the clamp to my desk WAY too tight, and the clamp actually broke. I'm hoping to get it replaced from Neewer though. You can tighten the clamp very very tight, which is what I usually do, but yesterday I put all my strength into tightening it, and it ended up breaking, haha.<br /><br />Anyways, awesome stand!
