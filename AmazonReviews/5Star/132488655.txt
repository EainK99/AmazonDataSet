You want to integrate realistic sounding Rhodes, Clav, Wurlitzer, and Organ into your rig?  You want to be able to carry it on your back to your gigs without breaking a sweat?  This keyboard is THE BEST on the market.  The USB interface to the Sound Manager software is huge, enabling you to download exactly the type of keyboard you want (huge selection of all keyboards from the 60's to the 90's).  You can set up memory banks of tweaked sounds using the built-in effects.  There are a couple different amp simulators, a number of effects that are workable, and the leslie simulator is one of the best on the market.  Using the control pedal you can add wah or volume control to sounds.<br /><br />Does the organ sound just like a Hammond/Leslie?  No, but pound for pound it's one of the best out there.  WIll you get the warmth and balls of a real rhodes, or the milky smoothness of a wurlitzer?  Not exactly, but they too are the best sounds out there without breaking your back and carrying the real thing.  The clav gives you so many tonal options that you'll think it's the real thing.  Even in the studio you can be easily fooled by the clav tone.  If you don't tell someone it's not a real clav, they'd have to have pretty amazing ears to hear that it's not.  Are the effects completely customizable to your exact specifications?  No, but they do add enough effects to the tones to get the quality you want.  If you want more control you'll need an effects processor, but I'll bet once you start working with this keyboard you'll find that the effects are fine for what you need.<br /><br />I'm a profesional touring musician, have been for many years, and don't have the crew to carry around the real instruments.  This keyboard replaces all of that, and does it so well only a handful of people (other professionals, and only some of them) will know the difference.  Worth every penny.<br /><br />Biggest drawback - the piano sounds are simply horrid.  You'll need another keyboard for that.  The weighting of the keys is based on the Hammond waterfall keyboards, so don't expect piano-style weighting.  Get yourself an 88-key weighted piano in addition to the Nord and you'll be a force to reckon with.  Also the chkicklet-style \\"drawbars\\" for the organ sound are awkward and frustrating to use on the fly.
