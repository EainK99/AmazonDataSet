My son has been playing violin for about 2 years and he has about a million books and sheet music. You walk through our apartment and they are just everywhere; in the hallway, bathroom, living room I've even found them on top of the fridge!<br /><br />I wanted to get him a place to store all his music in one place. I also wanted something that could be picked up and go to concerts, lessons or just out.<br /><br />This is a wonderful case that fits all his music and even has seperate compartments where he can store different types of music. It has a strap that crosses his body so his hands are free to carry his music stand case and violin case. It also has a place to write down his name, address and phone number.<br /><br />All in all if you want a great place to store your music that is easy to cary and looks stylish this is a great piece to add to your music collection.
