When I ordered the Bu2 it was damaged in shipment, before It got to me. The company called and said they were out of the BU2 and would substitute the Bu1 in it's place for the same price. I agreed and the BU1 arrived in fine condition. I had to move the bridge around till I got the best tone and loudness, and it took about a week before the strings stopped stretching, but it is OK now and the tone is very different from my Baritone. I really like it. It sounds so much better when I play fast songs. The Baritone is better on slow songs. Being smaller it is easier for me to play cords I had real trouble with on my Baritone. I'm very happy with my purchase.
