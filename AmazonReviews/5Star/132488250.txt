For a straight acoustic at the price these run they leave most competitors in dust. Some things worth note this is standard dreadnought size so it's not so jumbo as some in range, I think some makers build bigger chambers to make up for the lack of quality sound, not the case here. I'm not saying its scaled down though they have one (og1) version, it's just a little less cumbersome than others. It's a good design guitar the bridge is strong perhaps somewhat due to its frown shape it's got a nice tusq nut smooth board good frets, decent quality parts, and materials. It just doesn't feel or sound like what it costs...best explanation.<br />I bought a sound hole pickup for mine, which is a nice extra, nothing fancy just something to get some delay and flanger from practice amp, that's perfect sounding. Even the bridge pins have a touch of abalone dot sets off nicely. This piece is good for all levels of players, and for starters it's one that will serve proudly for future.<br />Some possible noted issues if you know guitars well may need minor truss adjusting depending on where you live and climate, I had to set mine 1/8 turn to get action spot on. Also for beginners can research or have pro-shop maybe sand/shave off little on nut or saddle, you can get perfect action. Like I said its a tusq nut those are 10$ alone so no need to change them may adjust though. don't tear up anything if your not comfortable there maybe 20$ or so get a good setup at guitar tech... would be worth it.
