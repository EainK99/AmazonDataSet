Excellent build quality and love the long cord.  The case is very tough with the solid metal housing and the outlets are nicely spaced so all my cords fit perfectly.  The power button lights up when it is on so it's a good visual indicator. Having a 15 foot power cord is more handy and helpful than I had imagined.
