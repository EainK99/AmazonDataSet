Great guitar for under 100 bucks, my kid still loves it, very good quality for the price. It does not sound as deep and loud as due to it being a thin body guitar, but it sounds pretty good regardless. Only problem we had with it was the nut on the jack came loose and the jack fell inside and I had to fish it out and re attach the nut, that took some time due to you cant get in there to reach the back of the jack especially with the strings on. Other than that its a great guitar.
