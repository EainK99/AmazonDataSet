This is perfect for elementary school teachers. Having to speak loudly all day, my throat would hurt by Friday and my voice would sound scratchy. This microphone has saved me. My students hate when I'm not using it because they're used to the clear, loud projection from the little speaker. It's light weight, easy to use, and you can adjust the belt easily. It stays charged for days. If I had to say something negative about it, I would say I hate that it dents my straight hair... Ha! I'll take dented hair over strained throat any day. A great investment!
