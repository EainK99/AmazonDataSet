My DJ friend recommended these headphones. I wear a 7 7/8&#34; hat (XXL). Most places don't even sell them that big. I read multiple reviews that these headphones are pretty tight, so I was worried, but I got them anyways. They feel GREAT. I have no idea what these people are talking about.<br /><br />-I put them on full blast and my co workers say they can't hear a thing.<br />-They feel great on my ears<br />-They sound great<br />-I don't look like a D-Bag
