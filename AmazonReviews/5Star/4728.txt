Excellent. I was looking for a flat sound to properly gauge my music mixing, and these speakers are great for that. Initially I thought the left speaker was too quiet thought...this has improved over time to the point where its no longer a nuisance. It's definitely a must-buy for those on a budget. Everyone compliments my speakers.
