I'd been using Stainless Steel strings for a long time. A friend talked me into trying these Cut Mangans. Wow! I would not have expected that much of a change. The strings sounded more defined, fuller and crisper (if that term makes sense in this context). I play a Strat which is already jangly. The Mangan strings keep that Strat sound and make each string more defined. This is anecdotal but, I think they're louder too.Whatever this \\"fusion matched\\" is, seems to be pretty effective. I think I may just be converted.<br />Update. After two months use I'm not as impressed. D-string broke after a week. And I'm noticing a kink in the G-string near the  bridge. The sound is good but, the strings don't seem reliable. I'm going back to my Rotosounds that never gave me a bit of bother. Just for info, I change strings about every three months with my regular usage. More often if I do more playing than usual. This Mangans sound really good but, I don't need strings that I have to worry all the time about breaking, especially at gigs.
