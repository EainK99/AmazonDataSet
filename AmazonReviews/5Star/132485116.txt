The cymbal set is a durable one for anyone who &#34;plays&#34; the drums as an instrument.....Any set of cymbals can be broken if played out of control or &#34;banged&#34; on......but none the less this cymbal set is durable and can last you a while even with the inexpensive price.<br /><br />I personally never had a problem with them
