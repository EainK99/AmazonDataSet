I was worried about getting this light so i bout only 3 to test them and their DMX features out.  I could not find anywhere that would tell me the rough par-can size, so after comparing it matches my Par 38 cans with gel plate on, minus a 1 centimeter lip.  The beam is much tighter than a 28 par can.  it would work well for an up light, or to accent something, but at 12 feet back it produces a semi-sharp round circle that is about 10 feet wide. It seems like is pretty even the beam seams to equal the distance minus 2 feet for the diameter of its glowing circle.  My Par 38 cans fill the room much more and are much less sharp it is hard to see an edge on the beam.<br /><br />Now this little light vs my Par 64 LEDs.  I am sorry, but there is no comparison a single par 64 will fill an entire 16 by 16 room, and it would require all 3 of these light to do that, but lat being said, I have a lot of complaints at my events about the Par 64 being too bright.  People actual ask that I point them toward the ceiling rather than across the floor to fill it because it is so bright, and with these small cans I would not get that complain.<br /><br />Can I see them with the lights on, yes, most colors.<br /><br />The beam for up lighting can be seen sharply for about 6-7 feet then it begins to dissipate, but on a 12 foot ceiling the final circle can still be seen. My par 64 cans beam will go about 10 feet before dissipating.<br /><br />Shining from one end to another with LIGHTS ON in a 30 foot room I could still see the light on the other side of the room, but I would say 30 feet is about the limit for this light.<br /><br />On the back if you are not using DMX it has dip switches to control colour, or you can go into sound mode and it will change colors to the music.  It has a volume control.  Manual switch colours mode can be slowed down via dip switch.  They call this chase, which it is so not chase.  It has a master slave mode, which work flawlessly with 3 light connected with2 30 foot dmx cables, and NO DMX terminator.  I tested Master/slave in sound active mode and in its \\"Chase\\" Mode.  The chase mode in master/slave, like its single mode setting, is the lights changing colour at the same time, not each light turning on one after another.  It says it can strobe but I cant get it to do it with out a DMX controller.<br /><br /> The mount and housing is well built metal. The face plate is made of glass, seems a bit thin, I see in my future this breaking, but looks easy to remove.  The DMX cables when plugged in go right to the edge of the mounting bracket, which will make it hard to stand on its own. So, plan on building some can of floor stands that will mount to the bracket.<br /><br />It has a permanent power cable, which I wish all lights would have removable, so I could leave my cables on my rigging and trellises, and just pull the lights when ending a gig. It has access to the fuse from the back, no need to take apart light to get to fuse.<br /><br />In conclusion, at $29 you could buy 8 of these lights for the cost of only 2 par 64.  It would allow you to get started with up lighting.  As for fill lighting it may be to tight, buy the two par 64s and it will fill the same area as 8 of these.<br /><br />Hope I helped in some way.<br />Practice, Preform, and Party!
