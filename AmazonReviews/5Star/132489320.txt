First of all, I'm an amateur at scratch mixing.  This review is for others like me.<br /><br />The scratch samples are on one side of the record.  They repeat every turn of the LP and the sounds are at the same location (like clock position) every time.  This makes them very easy to find, you don't have to cue up the exact spot on the record again and again, it's ok if it skips, and you don't need a headphone.  Genius!
