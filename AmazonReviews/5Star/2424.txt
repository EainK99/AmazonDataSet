Awesome ukulele. It sounds great, the A string usually has to be tuned for some reason, otherwise it's a great instrument. I would encourage you to start with a concert size ukulele, but this one is really good. Unfortunately, with it being a soprano, it only has 12 frets. But it's very well made, and easy 5 stars
