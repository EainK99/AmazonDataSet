The workmanship and finish on this guitar are fantastic. Don't let anyone tell you Mexican strats have low build quality. That may have been true in the past but this is a beautiful instrument that exceeded my expectations. I honestly can't find a flaw on it. You don't get some of the upgraded hardware of the Americans like locking tuners but the hardware is good.
