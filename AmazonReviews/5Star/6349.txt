The filter works as expected, significantly reducing the audible &#34;pop&#34; of stop consonants (including those troublesome &#34;P&#34;s and &#34;B&#34;s) in recorded material. The clamp is wide enough to accommodate stands of varying diameters, and the contact points are plastic to avoid scratching whatever it's attached to. In the particular situation I'm using this one for, it has to be mounted on the stand below the mic, and the gooseneck is A) long enough that I can position the filter where I need it, and B) stiff enough to stay in position once I have it where I want it. I've had other gear in the past which could only be reliably mounted from above the mic because when mounted from below, the weight of the filter would eventually drag the gooseneck down and out of position, so I definitely appreciate the fact that this one doesn't have that problem.
