Great case. Took it on overnight gig and side for pocket was big enough for extra t-shirt, socks and toiletries! Zipper is much smoother than earlier version. Strap is sturdy and hideaway backpack straps are a great addition. Horn fits a little too snug at first, but will break-in after one use. For Selmer SBA/Mk6 size. Won't fit Keilwerth. For Keilwerth try SKB 450, also excellent.
