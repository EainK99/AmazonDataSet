I played trumpet through my Junior high and High School years. I received a brand new King beginner model which was used through all these trumpet playing years. I played in a Symphonic Band, a Jazz Band and a marching band. This LJ Hutchen Trumpet was purchased for my daughter who was beginning in Junior High band and wanted to play the trumpet. I was hesitant because of the low price. But knowing that this company tests all of their instruments on more than one occasion and they stand behind their product, I decided to make the purchase and give it a try. It is a beautiful looking instrument, all the valves and tuning slides work smoothly. The materials look to be comparable to the quality of my King trumpet and it sounds just as good or better than the King trumpet. I truly think that this LJ Hutchen trumpet plays as good as any beginning or intermediate model that costs several hundred dollars more. I hope that it will stand the test of time.
