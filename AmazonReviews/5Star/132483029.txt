I searched the web for an alternate case for the EPIPHONE GENESIS LIMITED REISSUE guitar.<br />All I came up with was the EPIPHONE reissue case<br /><br />So, when I bought the guitar I ordered that specific case.<br />The reissue GENESIS case of course, has the vintage orange fur lining and the metal badge denoting<br />accuracy to the original case. After all, the EPIPHONE GENESIS is a limited run, reissued guitar.<br /><br />When I received the EPIPHONE case, I could not have been more disappointed.<br />At the cost of $99.00, the EPIPHONE GENESIS REISSUE CASE- is of POOR QUALITY.<br />Exposed hot glue webs and shards of hot glue that contact the guitars finish, loose lining edges, poor fitting lid. Of course, I returned it.<br /><br />So, I ordered this SKB-56 case from AMAZON.<br /> The GENESIS fits snug, however perfectly!<br />The GENESIS headstock is just a bit TALLER than the Les Paul, so it just contacts the padding.<br />The fit and finish of the SKB case, is light years better than any case EPIPHONE builds.<br />The EPIPHONE GENESIS is a wonderful guitar. Spend a few more dollars on a SKB-56 from AMAZON<br />to house it in. You won't be disappointed!
