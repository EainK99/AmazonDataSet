Reliable, easy to assemble, and very solid. I recently joined a community wind ensemble, in which *everyone* has his or her own stand, and I'm glad I got this one. As good as anyone else's and better than most.<br /><br />04/06/2014: I have had reason to rethink my review. The stand itself is great but the thumbscrews used to lock it in place are not durable at all. The clamps do not grab the metal well without a lot of tightening and I have stripped all three thumbscrews since buying this stand. I have had to basically rebuild the clamping mechanism in order to hold the stand where I want it. Even then I have had to caution my co-players not to touch it once it's in place. I bought it from remembering the Hamilton name from several decades of playing in bands and am rather disappointed in the lack of engineering durability put into the clamps.
