...well, to be fair, I owned a pair of Beats by Dre prior to purchasing these. Naive me, not knowing anything, thought my Beats would offer the best sound the market had to offer. I fell victim to flashy marketing and all that jazz, but I have been bathed in the light of truth. These headphones--Audio-Technica ATH-M50WH--totally kick butt.<br /><br />Yeah, my Solo Beats were flashy and they had a little remote to control my iPhone. That's all poppycock now--it's not about how shiny they are; it's all about the sound. The Beats were loud. They had a lot of bass. ...and that was it. Muddy, muddy bass and eardrum damaging volume. Hooray, right?<br /><br />I'm wearing my Audio-Technicas right now and realized that &#34;Float On&#34; by Modest Mouse had some weird background vocals going on near the end of the song. For non-audiophile newbies like myself, I can say that my music sounds crisp, clear, and clean. There isn't that &#34;BFFFTTT&#34; when songs get bass-y. There's none of that &#34;ZEEEEETTTTTTT&#34; garbage when tones get super high. It just sounds like freakin' music. EFF YOU, BEATS! EFF YOU, EARPODS! These are totally worth the money. The cable is a bit fat and cumbersome, and there's no iPhone/iPod control, but suck it up, pansy. Buy 'em.
