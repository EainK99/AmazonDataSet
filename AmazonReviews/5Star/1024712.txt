Teenager and husband took these to a concert. Said they would't need them. But were extremely glad they did!! Fits in a pocket and virtually unnoticeable (unlike earmuffs), so you don't look like a doofus. Worked great, and they could hear Weird Al Yankovic without their ears hurting the whole time. (Why so loud, Weird Al?!) Comes with a carrying case that will fit two pair. Saving them to use again.
