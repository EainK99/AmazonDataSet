I'm sure it would also be excellent for audio recording as well, although I haven't tried it just yet. Everyone tells me how crystal clear I am even without a pop filter. It looks cool, and gets a lot of remarks when people see it!<br />I got it when it was on sale, but wouldn't hesitate to pay full price for it if I ever had to replace it.
