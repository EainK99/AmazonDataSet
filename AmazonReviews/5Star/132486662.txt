I paid $200 for this guitar and at that price it is an extreme bargain.  This guitar is amazing even if it was a much higher price, but for $200 and $155 it is insane.<br /><br />My friend has a $3,500 Martin and this plays just as well and sounds amazing.  I can't say enough good things about this guitar.  If you are in the market for an affordable but professional quality acoustic guitar, this is for you.
