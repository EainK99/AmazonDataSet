This is the best acoustic guitar in the world for under $500. The Taylor Big Baby is a 15/16 sized Dreadnaught guitar. It has a Spruce top and laminate back and sides, and a bolt on neck of rosewood. This guitar has a narrow nut and low action and is ideal for beginners. Taylor is well known for producing some of the best crafted guitars available, but usually at a premium price. The guitar was perfectly setup at the time of purchase and intonation is perfect. This guitar is very light as well. The top end is crystal clear with the brightness you expect from Taylor guitars, but the bottom end is quite decent (but not as strong as on a full size Dreadnaught).  It does have a very light feeling to it...I'm not sure how &#34;hardy&#34; this model is, how it could handle bumps and such. My Seagull is much more solid feeling...but the Big Baby is SO DAMN FUN to play!
