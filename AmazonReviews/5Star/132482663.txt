I picked one of these up a while ago to solve the very simple problem of wanting more than one source to feed my headphones while gaming. I connect the audio output from my PC on channel 3/4 and the output from my smartphone on 5/6. And just like that, gaming, music, and phone calls can all be fed to my headphones with levels set appropriately. It's a bit overkill for my purpose, but, as a result of my setup, over 90% of the listening I do comes through this mixer. There is no discernible noise introduced by the 802, and EQ and pan functions are very helpful in certain situations. By far the best part of this setup is never having to adjust my volume within my pc's operating system. Having a physical volume pot to adjust, rather than alt-tabbing in and out of games, is downright luxurious.<br /><br />P.S. - Since there's no power switch, I like to power the 802 with a surge protector separate from the rest of my system. I use the switch on the surge protector as the on/off switch for my audio setup as well as a few lamps, etc. This saves me the possibility of damaging the fragile pins in the power connector.
