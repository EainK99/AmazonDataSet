I first met Mat and the Snareweight product last year before the NAMM show. I can honestly say that the original snare weight has been an essential tool for me live and in the studio. Without swapping snares I can achieve drastically different sound qualities by only swapping the inserts. Now Snareweight has introduced what I had hoped for a long time! Same idea but for tom toms. Awesome Mat! This company is amazing and their ideas are well thought out and reliable. I am once again so excited to be associated with Snareweight! Check them out drummers!
