This topper is for most modern cymbal stands (although some light weight modern stands and practically all vintage US stands use the [[ASIN:B0002F4M2A Cymbal Crown Quick Release Cymbal Holder 6 mm]] model. So measure first before ordering.<br /><br />What I love about this topper is the convenience. And to be totally honest I also love the price, which is less than similar release mechanisms such as the [[ASIN:B005SUXNYM Gibraltar SC-SNA Swing Nut Add-On Attachment]].  Another thing I love is the simplicity.  To mount your cymbal all you need to do is squeeze the post tines and slide the cymbal onto them, release and the cymbal is mounted and free floating. To remove the cymbal, squeeze the post and lift it clear. Simple and no extra moving parts.<br /><br />The material is sturdy and the crown itself is easy to install and use. The soft cup that supports the cymbal does a better job than a felt and cuts down on decay. Since I started using these I have noticed a discernible difference in my cymbals, including over and undertones that I had not heard when conventionally mounted.<br /><br />All in all this eliminates a wingnut, sleeve and felts - three parts to either lose or wear out, and it definitely cuts down on set-up and teardown time.
