The first thing that impressed me was Apogee's packaging.  The design immediately suggests this box contains a quality piece of equipment. Inside the box everything is neatly organized and the unit is well protected. Normally I wouldn't go on about the container but it's something I noticed as that extra touch. That matters to me.<br /><br />I had the original One for a short while, a friend had lent it to me. At the time, my Apple equipment was limited to an iPod touch.  I did, however, manage to use that One in conjunction with another recording setup and the sound enhancement was notable.  I now have a brand new, fully-loaded iMac and my iPad has been a close companion for well over a year.  I’ve been using a Scarlett 2i2 on my iMac and it has worked fine but I do hear the difference between those recordings and the project I did with the old Apogee One. So, when navigating the waters of Amazon recently I noticed they'd released a 2nd generation One.  Initially I thought a hundred bucks more for the new model was a bit of a stretch and it’s a lot more than the Scarlett.  But, I decided that if Apogee was ballsy enough to bump the price by 30%, I'd take the chance.<br /><br />The good things<br />- Build quality - Get this baby in your hand and it instantly feels good. The metal casing is solid and the product is well built. The rubber pad on the bottom keeps it from slipping around on your desk and in fresh coffee rings :-)<br />- One works with my iMac and my iPad - This is huge if you need to take your studio with you. You get both cables in the box and the Apogee software to control One works on both platforms. You do have to download the software from two different places Apogee’s site and the app store but that’s the only setup.<br />- Internal microphone - I remember the internal mic on the original One being surprisingly good (I used it for vocals).  The mic on the new One is excellent and it’s very convenient.<br />- Charging iPad and AA batterypower - One needs power on iPad but when you plug it in it with the AC cord it actually charges the iPad. Or you can use it with 2 AA batteries which is great for me. I have an iMac so on the go, my mobile setup is my One with my iPad.<br />- Two inputs at once - I don’t think the original One did this but the new One lets you record with the guitar input and the microphone at the same time. Very cool!<br />- Better listening - The other thing I’ve noticed with One is how much better my music sounds whether I am listening to my recordings or Spotify. It’s just a great little amp/DAC for the desktop.<br /><br />The criticisms<br />- The battery tray door was not easy to open. I had to work at that a bit but the batteries won’t be falling out!<br />- One lets you record with the mic and guitar input at the same time which is awesome for my songwriting workflow but when I use it with Garageband on my iPad it does not create separate tracks, just one stereo track. This may be a garageband thing.. because with GB on my Mac it is two separate tracks.<br /><br />Overall<br />- I’m pleased with this purchase and the premium you pay for Apogee is justified.<br />Easy to use, it sounds noticeably better, looks great with my Apple gear and it really is an all-in-One swiss army knife product for a musician. This is the One to get.
