Words cannot describe how this has changed my life. I wrote a song the moment I opened the box that contained this gift from heaven. I call it &#34;The Genie” because it made all my dreams come true.<br /><br />The Genie:<br /><br />Look at me and my rockin’ keyboard<br />It’s making my dreams come true (dreams come true)<br />Look at me tickling this ivory<br />It’s making my dreams come so true (so incredibly true)<br /><br />Chorus:<br />It’s the genie- and it grants three wishes<br />And those wishes are awesome and rad<br />Its my plastic genie, and it’s gonna help me rock better than Keith next door (because he’s a jerkface)<br />GENIE ROCK!!!<br /><br />**20 minute keyboard solo**<br /><br />Repeat chorus
