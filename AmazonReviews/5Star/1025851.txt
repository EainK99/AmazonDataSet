Shocking how well intonated and set up right out of the box. It was shipped tuned a bout a whole step low, but once I got it slowly up to proper pitch/tension, and only had to tweak 2 saddles to make it perfect. It plays beautifully, and has the big, clear, punchy tone you'd expect from jazzmaster pick up package. I am already in love with this thing, and I can think of a thousand uses for the extended range on small combo gigs. If you are on the fence, take the plunge. you won't regret it. Great bang for the buck in the price range.
