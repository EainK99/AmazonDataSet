The light bar felt solid and was pretty easy to install. I plugged it in and then tried it out in a few different places in my case before committing to applying the velcro swabs. I like that you can rotate the bar (tube I suppose) to direct the light, otherwise you would have very sharp light when looking at the bulbs. The light bleeds nicely at a wide angle. I plan on buying another one because when I was trying out difference spots in my case, I had a hard time deciding between two nice spots. My conclusion was I'd buy another and have the lights in both spots. The red one looked like lava in the bottom of my case, which was pretty sweet looking.
