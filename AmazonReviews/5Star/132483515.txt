I bought this cable from Guitar Center hoping it would work with my DTXplorer drum kit and luckily it did with no problems with latency or anything. I was able to use my drums as a midi controller in FL Studio with any vst. I didn't see any other reviews and decided to post this to let people know this thing does the job perfectly.
