I decided to build my own home theater subwoofer.  I bought a JBL GTO 1514D, and a pre-fab enclosure, and needed an amp.  I was going to buy one of several cheaper amps, but the reviews for this one pulled me in.  I couldn't be happier!  I am running this amp at 2 ohms on each channel.  One channel I have the JBL 15 inch, which has dual 4 ohm voice coils in parallel, and on the OTHER channel, I have two 4 ohm 12 inch MTX woofers in parallel, each in different cabinets.  So really this is powering a single 15 inch and two 12 inch subs, matched and driving at 2 ohms for my home theater.  I come out of my SUBWOOFER out from my receiver and split to both channels.  I decided not to run in parallel mode, since the single JBL and dual MTX's have slightly different low end responses, I needed to use an EQ to optimize both at the low ends, and remove one resonant range from the MTX's.  The result:  I keep the volume knobs on #4 (less than half volume) and when I crank my 5.1 surround receiver, the low end lights up so loud, and so clear, using this amp, that I could not believe it.  Here's proof: With my last home theater powered subwoofers, and whatever internal subwoofer amp it had, the entire home theater experience for sound, when cranked, was according to my wife, \\"a bit irritating\\".  I just loved it since it was cranking, but knew I was slighly over driving the low end.  With this amp and subs that can take this amps power, my wife now ENJOYS watching movies with the sound up LOUDER than before, because it is so clear, it's a whole different experience.  Amp runs cool even when I pushed it for a 5 min test and clipped it.  I could actually smell the heat from my subs voice coils, moreso than feel like this amp was just sitting there idling.  Love it!
