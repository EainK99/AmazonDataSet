I was having trouble installing the product so I called customer service and left a message describing my problem. The next morning Travis the owner and inventor himself called and walked me through the process. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be able to play a song on the very first day that they put it on their guitar.Travis was also super nice and very concerned about his customers being happy!!!
