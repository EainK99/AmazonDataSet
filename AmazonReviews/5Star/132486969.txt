We have a profession production company (I am the Founder of \\"Ultimate Survival Tips\\" Look us up on YouTube)... and we needed affordable professional and a PORTABLE sound for shooting audio for our video productions... in the field.<br /><br />>> BETTER than GIANT SQUID and 10x Cheaper &lt;&lt;<br /><br />We tried about everything to \\"up\\" the quality of our sound including a pretty pricy Giant Squid mic that proved to be a disaster.<br /><br />Then I stumbled on a review of these clip on lapel mics... and found out they were less than $5 for 3 (at the time)... I HAD to give them a try. But honestly, I did't expect much... However, when we actually used them I was MORE THAN pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />>> HOW WE USE THEM &lt;&lt;<br /><br />We use Zoom H1 recorders (and sometimes our Zoom H4N) either clipped to our belts or shoved in a pocket... and then we plug one of these mics right into the 1/8\\" \\"in\\" jack. Then in post production we use Final Cut Pro to Sync our multi-cam video clips and audio and away we go.<br /><br />>> PERFECT FOR ON-LOCATION VIDEO PRODUCTIONS &lt;&lt;<br /><br />I don't fuss at all with plugging a mic directly into my cameras any more and there's no need to buy an expensive Senheiser G3 system as these mics honestly sound about as good and have NO Batteries to wear out in the middle of a shot... Plus if I break a mic it's costs me what? $1.50 US to replace it... Oh, and by the way, I have a Senheiser G3 system also... but rarely use it.<br /><br />>> EXCELLENT NOISE CANCELATION &lt;&lt;<br /><br />This little mic REALLY sold me the day we went out and shot a survival video on a beach in South Carolina... all of my other mics picked up excessive wind noise from the constant ocean breezes including my Giant Squid mic (which was actually so terrible I haven't used it since - I don't even know where it is NOR do I care)... BUT this little cheap mic sounded great and had virtually NO wind noise...<br /><br />>> TO LISTEN TO THIS MIC - CHECK OUT THIS VIDEO &lt;&lt;<br /><br />If you want to hear how these mics perform even on a windy beach, search Google for \\"Nasty survival food 101\\" and click on the video thumbnail. I also use these mics in every video intro that I do for Ultimate Survival Tips. Go to Ultimate Survival Tips Channel on YouTube and Click on any of the last 10 or so videos...<br /><br />>> YOU'D DUMB NOT TO GIVE THIS MIC A TRY &lt;&lt;<br /><br />So... if you are looking for a GREAT lapel mic and you're about broke, or even a pro who is just looking for great sound... I think you'll really be happy with this great 3x deal from Neewer... In fact, I am going to buy 3 more right now... just in case I loose or ever break the ones I have.<br /><br />Hope this helps!!!<br /><br />~Davidr />If you want to hear how these mics perform even on a windy beach, search Google for \\"Nasty survival food 101\\" and click on the video thumbnail.
