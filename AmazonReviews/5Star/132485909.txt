My 3 years old grandson was absolutely thrilled. He was not even ready to let his dad assemble the thing. After that he immediately formed a band with his dad and mom.<br /><br />The set is surprisingly professional for its price and would be a joy to any music loving kid.<br /><br />The look is also very upmarket.
