These things are awesome! Not sure how they are shielded or if it's just the short distance but the offset connecter fit between any two of my multiple side - plug effects pedals. I was having serious hum issues with all my effects lined up on my Line 6 as well as with my array split on my Marshall between guitar to amp input and the effects loop. I replaced a couple of cords and some cheaper connecter with these and my sound is as clean as I want it to be, even through multiple effects. It's even hum and noise - free when I'm playing my s/s/s v strat with heavy tube overdrive cranked!
