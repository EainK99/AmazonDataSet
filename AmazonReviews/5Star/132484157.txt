I was looking for a secure and sturdy stand for my Viola.  I wanted it easy to travel with. Yet, I did want it to be too expensive.  I don't like the one you put that allow you to hang on the music stands. It is easy for people to bump in to them and there goes your precious. I invested in this item and love it. I have had it more than a year now. Everyone in my Viola section in the Symphony wants one. It folds and fit right in to my bag when I travel.  It was never fallen over even when someone bumped it. I use it at home so I don't have to put my instrument up every time. (To keep dust off place a pillow case over it.) I highly recommend.
