Very sturdy and holds my 15 inch Remo Djembe, no problem. On the downside (somewhat) it's fairly heavy, but then that's why it's sturdy. It did take me a few minutes to figure out how to set it up but otherwise it sure beats having the drum strapped to your body and carrying the weight while you're playing. Definitely worth the money if you can afford it.
