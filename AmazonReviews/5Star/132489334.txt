I use the MXR M108 between the preamp and power amp stages of my 50 W tube amp (which didn't have an effects loop, so I added one using a normally-closed tip-ring-sleeve 1/4&#34; jack). It's particularly useful for spectrally sculpting distorted tones. I've been playing through it for a few months with no problems, and the unit appears sturdy and well-built. If you insert the M108 at some point beyond the preamp, mind the 14 dBV (5 volt RMS) maximum input and output specifications!
