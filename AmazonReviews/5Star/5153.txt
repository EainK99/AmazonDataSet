Very very good maracas.  They feel like a dream in the hands, and the handles are bulbed out where you should hold them for best control...and the sound is crisp and LOUD.  You can dial it back for sultry hushed accents, or lay in to them and punch through any wall of sound.<br /><br />I can't think of any negatives to them, and for the price I don't think you can go wrong, if you like the sound of wood maracas over rawhide, or gourd varieties.
