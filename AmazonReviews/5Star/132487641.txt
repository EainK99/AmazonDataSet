I couldn't hear my guitar at church above the Clavinova that is blaring right next to me as I am kind of behind my amp. I'm sitting down so I don't need an expensive wireless system. So I plugged this into my external speaker jack, put in one earbud and let the other sit in my shirt pocket so it doesn't pull on my ear and now I can turn my earphone volume up until I can hear my solo's great but I can hear the rest of the band too. Perfect. Several people told me that Behringer stuff is poor quality but I had a Behringer mixer once that sounded fine, so I took a chance. It is quiet, no hiss or hum, works exactly as I had hoped it would, and I highly recommend it if you don't need a cordless solution.
