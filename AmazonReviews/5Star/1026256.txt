This TNP Galaxy Tab case fits perfect and I love how slim it is. It seems protect my tablet really well. Now I don’t have to worry about the back getting more scratched up (it already has two that’s why I am so happy to now have this case) and I can keep my tablet looking new. I think that the price on this case is really good for how great the case looks, and all the cute styles that it comes in. I would like to get one more just to be able to switch it out once in a while.  My daughter was so excited that she could prop up the tablet and watch her favorite ABC songs when we were practicing. I would definitely buy another one for my other tablet. These are great cases and the stand is just a added bonus. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
