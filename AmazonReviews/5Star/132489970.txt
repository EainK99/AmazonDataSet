I have always loved Jukeboxes. I always wanted a bubbler jukebox in my house but a full size jukebox can run multiple thousands of $$$. I bought a crosley that I can plug in my iPhone years ago. It plays the music but the tube colors stay the same. This jukebox I connect my ipad and the sound is good, and best off all the tubes change colors.  It truly seems to be a quality 'mini, jukebox.  I just wish they didn't discontinue the Jr version of this for the iPhone. And I wish there was a great jukebox app that would work hand in hand with this since your ipad will be in portrait mode. Love it
