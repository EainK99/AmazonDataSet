If you are just starting out or in band for the first time, you cannot go wrong with this trumpet.  I purchased this for my kid as he is starting band for the first time and we simply did not want to pay the super expensive school rental prices.<br /><br />I purchased a $300 trumpet for myself to practice with my kid thinking that since I had some experience on this instrument a better quality trumpet would better suite me, but this could not be further from the truth.  The tone on this trumpet is identical to the more expensive trumpet - I'm guessing the more expensive version was made from slightly lighter materials as this was the only real difference.<br /><br />I wanted to purchase a blue with brass trumpet for myself, but I guess those sold out because the picture now shows a blue with silver trumpet.<br /><br />I'm sure this trumpet won't last a life time, but as I told my kid, take care of it and it will at least see you through middle school and possibly through high school.<br /><br />He loves it and is now known though his school as \\"The boy with the blue trumpet\\"
