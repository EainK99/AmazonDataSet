I absolutely love my Casio Privia PX330! I play for fun, at parties and occasionally perform professionally and this baby has more bells and whistles than I could ever learn to use. I love the weighted key action and it sounds darn good with no amplification and fabulous through a PA. It is slim and fairly lightweight and not very bulky to transport. Although many of the auto accompaniment rhythms and various tones are kind of cheesy, there are many beautiful tones and really excellent organ and piano tones. As I play a lot of folk, world music and Americana music, I really appreciate the beautiful harp tone, accordion and melodeon, and harpsichord. I also love the arpeggio feature, but wish there were more arpeggios to pick from. My only big complaint about this keyboard is that the buttons and labeling by the buttons is extremely hard to read. I have to have an itty bitty book light clipped onto the keyboard unless I am in a very bright room. A lit up digital display would be great. But on the whole, for the sound, features, weighted keys, etc., this is without a doubt the best electronic piano in it's price range.
