It appears there are many similar stylus force gauges on the market. I chose this one almost at random. It arrived 6 business days later, so shipping is fairly fast, especially considering that the origin is Dongguan in mainland China. (Interesting place – check out the Wikipedia entry!)  If you are reading this before ordering, be aware that batteries are not included. It would be helpful if the type of battery were specified in the listing, as these batteries are not that readily obtainable except by online ordering. The printed instruction page incorrectly states that the batteries are lithium. However the AG12 battery (two are required) is in fact alkaline. It is a 1.5V button battery. Cross references are LR43 (Duracell and Maxell) and 186 (Energizer). These are low-drain batteries for general use.  You can find the AG12 inexpensively on Amazon (various brands but not the name brands), and I recommend you order them when you place your order for the stylus force gauge.  A strip of 10 batteries (the minimum order from my source) cost $8 with shipping.  Caution: in the lifted position your tone arm may not be high enough to be moved into position. You'll probably have to manually lift it and set it on the weighing platform for the gauge. The measurement of my tracking force confirmed that I had previously set it very close to the recommended stylus force for my cartridge.  I tweaked my tonearm counterweight adjustment a little in order to get it as close as possible.  In summary, the gauge works. I am well satisfied.
