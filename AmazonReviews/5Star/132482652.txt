This won't be a long review.  I got a set of Pearl Elite Bongos at a bargain price, and needed a carrying case.  This bag doesn't seem like it was designed just for bongos, but the fairly large Pearl bongos fit easily in the rectangular case diagonally, and are well protected.  They don't move around, and it's easy to carry.<br />The bag is well made too.  It seems to have two extra fuzzy sheets that can be velcro'd in, but I have no idea what they are for.  Maybe to add some extra thick protection in case you lose the rubber pads on the bongo's feet?  There's room for music and some extras in the case too.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars based on only paying $14 or so and getting it via amazon prime.  I would gladly have paid twice that had I know the quality, which fit's with the regular price.  It's a really nice case, but since I'm not a pro, I don't want to say it would be worth the $64 regular price to a gigging bongo player, because while the quality fits the $64 price, I can't say the design is that much better than the cheaper bongo cases.
