I saw a demo of this on Youtube and was instantly sold by the options you got and the sound quality everything I read was raving about. I got mine, put in some batteries, and it worked flawlessly through a standard set of headphones and sounded far better than I expected. I wouldn't recommend this for on stage performances (although some people have done that in the reviews I have read) but for warming up or working out ideas it is truly awesome.
