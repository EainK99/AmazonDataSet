I was looking for a mic that I can turn off when I don't need it mainly so I can talk to the other members of the band and the audience can not hear me. This one is Shure quality and works perfectly. The mic stand and mic cable are sturdy and work well. If I was looking for an entire package, I would not hesitate buying another.
