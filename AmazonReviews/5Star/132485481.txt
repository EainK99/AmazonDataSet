My girlfriend choose the color, ha!<br /><br />good quality, and you won't be disappointed if this size of pick was exactly you were looking for.<br /><br />I used to play with the regular size (smaller) of picks, but last concerts I wanted something that I could grab easily.<br /><br />I play jazz and I tell you with this picks you can really go fast.<br /><br />But don't dream about it. Without 4-6 hours of practice any pick is useless!!
