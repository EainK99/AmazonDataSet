I personally really love this guitar. I bought it awhile ago as my first &#34;expensive&#34; guitar, and I was very satisfied. It has a very nice sound with some pretty decent pickups and hardware, and the overall look and finish of the guitar is beautiful. It has such a unique, classy look to it. Besides the sound and looks though, the playability is also very nice. The neck doesn't feel too big or awkward and I've always had a good time playing it. The one thing that my friends have commented on it, however, is that the neck is too &#34;thick&#34; or &#34;round&#34;, if that makes sense. As in they preferred playing on necks that were a little thinner or flatter, but I never had a problem with it. As long as you take good care of it, the guitar will last a long time and still sound nice. I would recommend this guitar to anyone. Also, Mikael Akerfeldt is the man.
