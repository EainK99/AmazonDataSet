I investigated for months. I looked around for weeks. I considered many other options. I kept coming back to Ibanez. But I wanted to get a sense of the size and feel of these guitars. So I went down to the local music store to look at them. The experience sold me on Ibanez but the local music store could not compete on price. I'm so very happy with this purchase it's hard to describe. For me, this guitar is perfect in every way. The finish, the sound, the features; All meet or exceed my expectations. I bought the AS93 in Violin Sunburst and it's drop-dead beautiful. I can't bear to walk by without touching it and isn't that the whole point? To me, a guitar is as personal as what you wear or how you part your hair. Maybe more so. You're going to spend a lot of time with your arms wrapped around it. You best like what you're holding. The Violin Sunburst color is warm and deep and makes the guitar appear far more expensive than what I paid. I know others have been critical of this color option saying it's boring. But, if you have a refined sense of style, color and clean lines this is a wonderful choice. As for sound, this too is amazing. I play light jazz, some blues and popular tunes. I can capture every nuance I want. The guitar needed no adjustment on arrival and the seller was nice enough to tune it before shipping. As for shipping, I purchased my guitar from Mike's Brass and Woodwind. The guitar was double boxed and arrived without a mark or blemish. One last thing. The guitar is sometimes pictured with and without a black pic guard. It comes without the pic guard which made me very happy. I thought the pic guard took away from the design and lines of the guitar. If you really need one, I'm sure it can be added. If you need to hear for yourself what this guitar can do, you can go to YouTube.com and listen to a 7+ minute demonstration of the Ibanez AS93 Artcore by Mark Lucas of NstuffMusic.
