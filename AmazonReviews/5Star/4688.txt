Just what I ordered and they're exactly as pictured. Using them on one of my SGs and they sure look pretty on it. The insides are soft enough you could make them work on either metric or US sized pots. I used them on an Epiphone with metric sized pots and another I had replaced the pots with CTS (US size).
