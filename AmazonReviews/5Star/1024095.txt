This is a great, comfortable all cotton strap. It is strong and thick enough to hold a heavy instrument yet still easy to adjust quickly.<br /><br />The quality is definitely much higher than represented in the ad picture. It's very well worth the price and exceeds any other strap that I know of in quality at that price point.<br /><br />  The only suggestion that I would make to Levys is that perhaps they can make a version with Schaller or Dunlop pre-cut holes already made at the ends to accommodate those model strap locks .<br />  Since the strap is so well made and of tough leather materiel, it's a bid of a job to cut holes to accommodate strap lock models. that would definitely be very helpful.
