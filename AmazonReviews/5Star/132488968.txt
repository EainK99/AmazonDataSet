I was looking for a very good pair of ear buds as I've been using cheap ones for a while now.  My replacement needed to stay in my ear, deliver great sound, be of quality construction, and reduce outside noise.  The 315's accomplished all these and I didn't mind spending a little more for them.  I've seen other replies stating that they had issues with quality, hoping that doesn't happen to me given the expense of these.  So far, so good.  I would recommend these to anyone who doesn't mind shelling out a up to $200 for a set of good ear buds.
