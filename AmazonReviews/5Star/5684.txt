These strings sound like they came off an angel's harp...they have a very nice bright tone and they've held up pretty well, as they're designed to. They're a bit pricey for a set of strings, but once you put them on and play them you'll know why. I would definitely recommend them, and if these things ever wear out, I'll most likely buy another pack.
