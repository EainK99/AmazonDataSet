I put this pickup into a replica i made of the Van halen Frankenstrat,It Started as a 1975 Harmony Strat copy.Once i installed the pickup and turned it on i was compltely Blown away with the sound of this thing! id say it was a 500% improvement and i plan on getting another one very soon for my Dime Razorback!
