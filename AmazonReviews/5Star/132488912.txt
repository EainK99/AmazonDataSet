Extremely satisfied with this purchase.  I blow my shofar every shabbat and every special occasion that comes along.  My shofar is beautiful and I am one of the very few women that I personally know that blows the Shofar. The cost and the shipping time were very good and the quality of my shofar is excellent.  My shofar is about 42\\" long and at some later time I want to buy a longer one since the sound will be slightly different.
