This was very easy to put on using the leather thong. I passed the small strap-end between the middle four tuning pegs on my a-style mandolin and I took a quick photo and just looped the thong through the two ends the way it came from the seller. I really like the soft leather and quality-feel. It's never slipped once, but I only use this on the one instrument.<br /><br />Right now, it's perfect, so I probably wouldn't switch this to other instruments because taking it off and on will stretch the hole and make it not fit as well. I'll probably just get another one for my uke.
