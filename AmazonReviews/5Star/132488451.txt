These headphones are truly great. I am not an &#34;Audiophile&#34; in the sense that I can rattle off technical information but I can tell you this, these sound amazing. They are worth every single penny I spent. They have very deep base for a set of headphones and all tones seem good. Comfortable fit and comes with an adapter that fits the larger 3.55 millimeter plug.
