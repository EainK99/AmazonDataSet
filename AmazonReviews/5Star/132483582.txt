I've used several kinds of neck straps in the past, but they've all either been way too uncomfortable or gotten tangled up into a terrible mess.  I have found this one the hardest to accidentally tangle up, and it feels very nice and comfortable.  It helps me concentrate on perfecting my sound and technique when playing without having to worry about discomfort.
