Cremona makes a good quality instrument at a reasonable price point.  My 4th grader used this for beginning violin classes at school, and it worked out really well.  Construction materials are good quality -- ebony board and tuning pegs.  The fine tuners were a little cheap feeling, but performed just fine.  There are a lot of \\"toy\\" violins out there -- this isn't one of them.
