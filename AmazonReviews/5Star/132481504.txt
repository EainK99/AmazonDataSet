this is a great tool.  Functions flawlessly, and note mode is pretty cool.  I mostly use my akai lpd8 for drumming, but i use the apc20 as my main keyboard.  built like a tank, and the lights are super nice.  yeah yeah the con about having to be externally powered, but not biggie.  Ive seen a sweet mod about how to take the rubbery wings off the sides for a smaller footprint on your desk.<br /><br />the Live lite software is nice included, I cant say much about it tho, as I use Live 9.<br /><br />The Akai APC20 is a great answer to Ableton.  Hands down.
