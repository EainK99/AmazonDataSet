Possibly one of the best strings there is especially to math rock players who tap on the strings. the strings are light but they seriously laat long not like the cheap earnie ball or those other ugly big rusty strings that sound horrible. the quality sound in these are superb. Elixer are very close to cleartones so i would recommend those as well but cleartones are your best bet. they can last up to a year or 2 and they dont rust. simply the best strings there is
