I physically went into a store and bought a Kala concert ukulele. Their cases were nothing special and seemed a bit pricey. I'm glad that I went home and put the order in for the Kala Polyfoam Case. It's  a good fit. The outer pocket is kind of neat, but I haven't used it yet. The pocket is not big enough for standard sized paper but would do well holding misc. things like tuners and spare strings.
