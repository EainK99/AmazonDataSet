I got this at my local shop and this is a work well tuner and gets u out of a bind when tuning. This fits anywhere on the head stock of any ax (guitar or bass) or any instrument 4 that matter. I was worth the $10 I spent plus Tax. it uses the common c r-3202 bat any clip-on tuner uses so try one and see 4 u self. I love mine!!!
