I would NOT recommend this trumpet. Initially this item was a great idea for my son who is new to band. I thought the price was nice especially because he had never played a trumpet before and I was not sure if he would like it or be any good at it. This item comes with everything you could need for the trumpet, which is fantastic. However the item is cheaply made. My son fell down three stairs and the trumpet (still in its case) hit him in the head. The trumpet horn was damaged. I ordered another one and it arrived with a damaged horn.<br /><br />The sound quality isn't as great either compared to the averaged priced trumpets. My son was unable to play a few notes with this trumpet. His instructor who is a professional also had a hard to getting certain notes to play.<br /><br />I would say although the price is attractive don't waste your dollar. You will regret the purchase. In my case I went through two of these trumpets which is practically the cost of the better quality trumpet.<br /><br />- DO NOT RECOMMEND.
