I have been buying these strings for years for a Jazz Bass and have never been happier.  The coating is great, looks awesome but doesn't have that coated feel.  They are also very durable, I was regularly going through strings using &#34;slap and pop&#34; techniques and these hold up much better.  For my other basses I use the black ones to match better.  I'll never buy a different brand of strings again.
