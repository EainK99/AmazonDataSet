After using these for the past year at least twice a week for gigs, they have hit the ground and been pounded on quite a bit but these headphones still look and sound amazing. I was telling my friend how good they have been to me and that very night at my gig I stretched the headband past its limit and it broke): I do not blame the product quality but just be careful with that because I am constantly manipulating the headphones on and off my ears with my hands and shoulders. Aside from that djn is about the music and these have a more refined look not flashy, all while providing excellent monitoring. buy these and enjoy them! just dont spin progressive house go deep
