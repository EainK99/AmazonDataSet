Had these for three years, forgot to write a review on these when I ordered them. These continue to be the very best headphones I've EVER owned (although they are the most expensive I've probably purchased as well)... you get what you pay for (most of the time). I did have a set of studio headphones I inherited from my Dad, but they ended up dieing, and I needed to replace them.<br /><br />These days it's hard to find quality workmanship, and quality products. So hard, in fact, there are many companies that sell their terrible workmanship, at a higher price, to make people 'think' they are getting better quality. Not these, well worth every penny.<br /><br />This is pretty much an easy recommendation for me. Truthfully, I wouldn't ask any more than what these things deliver, I have no gripes (even after more than 3 years of ownership). I expect these to last a lot longer.
