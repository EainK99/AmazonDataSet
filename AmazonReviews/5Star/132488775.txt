I can't say enough about the 58A.  I used the 58 in studio and really liked it, but for the extra $50, this mic makes you work 1/2 as hard for better sound.  I use it for tracks that are on the heavier side.  I've recommended it to so many people I've lost track.  All of whom have had the same opinion.  I love this thing.
