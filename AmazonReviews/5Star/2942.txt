I was sick of leaving my guitar in my case, the extra step of taking it out was just too much effort to play very often. Yes, I am ashamed. Now that I have this sweet stand I am playing all the time. The guitar is perched there, just begging to be strummed. I love how simple yet functional this case is. I feel confident that the guitar won't tip over, and there is soft rubber in all the right places. And it takes up such little space. I am thinking of buying another guitar just so I can get another stand!
