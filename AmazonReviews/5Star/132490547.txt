I purchased these timbales and received them on Friday, the box they came in was very sturdy and the drums very protected. These timbales are  awesome, they sound a lot better than my Tito Puente LP's, and a lot lighter, and the black finish on the shells make them look very cool.The only thing I did not like was the cow bell that was included, gave that away and added the LP's I had stashed away. For anyone looking for a set of timbales for a good price, great quality look no further, oh, just in case the stand is very robust and I know it will stand up to the test of time................very happy I purchased these.
