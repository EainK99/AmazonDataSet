I've read countless reviews on the Stanton SCS3 and I was skeptical based on what people were saying.  I own a pair of technics - both digital and vinyl, virtual vinyl and I use my equipment for remixes and small projects.  I like messing with new dj equipment.  I plan on buying a Pioneer DDJ-SX for Christmas...but getting back to the SCS3, this device is a lot of fun to use.  Take it for what it's worth.  Yes it's a touchscreen.  Yes their isn't a knob for the crossfader...that's because it's a touchscreen.  This works well with Virtual DJ Pro and has the skin to match too.  If you're a newbie to digital mixing then this will help you right along.  Those that are well versed in the field will find this too easy to use and get bored with it.  When I need to kill some time and clear my mind the Stanton helps greatly.  Considering the medium is constantly pushing for new tech I wonder if this would work with the SmithsonMartin Emulator?  Maybe I'll try it sometime next year...
