I used 4ft sections of these lights on my sailboat, they work great at a navigation station as night reading lights, very low power consumption, even lower than specified. They also give very nice even lighting, no shadows or bright spots as with normal bulbs. 12V is great for vehicles and boats because it can be connected directly to the battery. Very good quality for price.
