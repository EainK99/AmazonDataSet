If you are learning any instrument these hangers are a must have.  You keep your floor space and hangind the insrtument is a great way to store it.  You are much more likely to practive with the instrument already out of the case and ready to go.  I have these for my guitars as well.  Another good benefit is the pate that holds the instrument threads into the wooden base so if you want to rearrange instruments all you have to do is unscrew the hanger from its base and move it to a different base.
