When it first arrived, I was a little surprised by the size and weight.  After resting a few of my larger music books on it, my opinion has changed.  It built to support the largest and heaviest music books.  This is not the el-cheap-o wire music stand the kids use band in elementary school.  I have my keyboard on a large utility table and this music stand sits behind it.  I can easily store it under the table when not in use.<br /><br />It is perfect for my situation.
