It is solid and well-built. It is great for getting different types of sounds for recordings. I bought it after hearing Buckethead use it on &#34;Soothsayer.&#34; It is one pedal with three functions: harmonizer, whammy, and detuner. $300 seems high, but if you consider that each function in it is $100, it is a fair price.<br /><br />The only thing I despise about it is that the power socket is on the left side. If you have a daisy chain, you probably have to make it your first pedal or else you cannot power it. It should be on the top just like most pedals.
