It's the best!  It easily holds my open music books three deep so they're right in my grasp to swap around when I need to look up a scale or a chord etc.<br />And It looks great too..bright stainless steel.  Can't remember if its solid or plated SS.  Time will tell if it pits.<br />The only negative is that it has a slight wobble to it....doesn't sit perfectly flat because of the way it's hinged.  But with books on it, it's fine.<br />It was pretty tight at first, a little difficult to open, but now it's just right.<br />I highly recommend it.
