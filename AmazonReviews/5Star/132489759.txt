This mic is for all type of uses. I use it for Skype with friends and playing online games. The recordings are very clear, and everyone can hear me clearly. The sensitivity adjustment is an awesome touch that will allow you to control what you want the mic to pick up.<br /><br />Worth it. Although the switches should be made of metal instead of plastic.... But still worth it!
