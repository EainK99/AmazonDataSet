On this day I received the violin you bought, already tuned and my daughter is testing at this time. She is a member of the System of Orchestras in Venezuela which directs Maestro Abreu and Dudamel. And I must say that the sound is above the violins of other brands, including Cremona for student. We are pleased with the instrument as it met all our expectations. We are considering revising their catalago to choose uno violin 4/4 time thinking about the professional future of our daughter. Sincerely, thank you very much for your great products and for their excellent care.
