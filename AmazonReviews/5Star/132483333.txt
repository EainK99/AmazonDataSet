I needed a back-up Karaoke Player and ordered a VOCOPRO DVX-890K DVD Karaoke Player. Had problems; returned it for a replacement. Replacement had same problems; returned it with no replacement; See my Customer review on the returned items for details. Ordered the VocoPro DVG 777K-III Player and so far it's GREAT. Sound, text, useability ALL EXCELLENT. It's simple and well made. Although I'm still testing it and will update this review when testing is completed, I'm optimistic. If it works out as I expect, I plan on ordering another one as a NEWER Backup for my Karaoke system. As a footnote, Amazon Return policy and process is OUTSTANDING IN ALL REGARDS.<br />OCTOBER 08, 2013: This Player continues to perform so I ordered another one From Amazon.com as a back-up unit. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.............
