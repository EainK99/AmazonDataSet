I got to say,. after owning so many entry level studio monitors, the Eris E5 are outstanding! My M-Audio's went out in the middle of mixing a tune. When I replaced them with the Presonus, I actually caught guitars that were not playing the correct notes and chords with the bass!!!! That was partially because my M Audio's were too big for the new room I was using. You can't go wrong with these. Just fantastic monitors.
