I own this and a Worldmax Black Dawg and they are nearly identical. I'll outline the differences below. Regardless of pedigree this is an excellent snare drum that is a little more cutting than a [[ASIN:B00502CB78 Ludwig LM400 Supraphonic]] and beautiful tonality that only a brass shell can deliver.<br /><br />Here are the similarities between this and the Dawg: both have a brass shell with a welded seam in the same spot, both have the S9X strainer (by Worldmax) and the tube lugs appear to be plated Worldmax TU100s. Note that the hole spacing for the strainer is different from the main line of Ludwig snare drums, which means that you cannot upgrade it to a P86.<br /><br />The differences are in the finish, which is a beautifully done black nickel plating on all metal parts, better snare wires and some of the most interesting diecast hoops I have seen. The hoops are thinner and lighter than most modern diecast ones and do not choke the life out of a drum like most. The hoops attenuate the tendency of the brass shell to ring, but still leave some resonance.<br /><br />This drum can definitely cut through loud amps, but is sensitive enough to work well in a jazz piano trio as well. It literally shines in a studio because of the diecast hoops and because of them have a fairly even and wide frequency range.<br /><br />If you are seeking a versatile snare drum that will work in practically any musical setting this is a great candidate. It's not quite as nice as a true Black Beauty, but it's close and does not carry the hefty price tag of one of those.
