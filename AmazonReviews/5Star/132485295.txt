The answer is a 100% yes! There's NO tricks or catch to this product, you literally get 16.4 ft of LEDs (I measured), I got them quick, I tested them, they work just as I thought and they are VERY bright and versatile! One led light was out but that's not bad considering I am not going to use all 16.4 feet, and for the price you can't beat it. I WILL refer my friends to this product and I recommend any indecisive customer, you can't find this deal anywhere else!
