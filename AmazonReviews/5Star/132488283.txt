Hey, this is a very cool AB switch, that does more that your standard AB switch. The two modes and volumes makes this a step up from the norm. And the LED's shows you what path you've taken, just by looking. Other well known brands sell these with less features for way more money. Above all else, making it in pedal form makes it all the more usable. I use it to play guitar in stereo/mono between two amps, but you could use it to switch between two guitars, or whatever switching needs you have. Cool deal here. I know the price won't hurt you either.
