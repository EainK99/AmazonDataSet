I'd been in the market for a pitch shifter pedal for a little bit. Once I saw this one I knew that it was going to the be one I wanted. It is limited in that you can't designate a key but It does allow you to shift of 17 cents, through Minor 2nd, Major 2nd, Major 3rd, Perfect 4th, Perfect 5th, Major 6th, Minor 7th, 1 Octave, 2 Octaves and 3 Octaves. A three position toggle switch controls whether the pitch is transposed up, down or both. In Dual mode, two pitch-shifted signals are output. I use this mainly for 1 octave up and 1 octave down giving almost an 18 string effect. While it can't track full bar chords it definitely doesn't have any issue with playing 2 or 3 notes at a time. It's really fun to stack it with a good fuzz pedal (In my case an EQD Hoof). Gives you a wall of sound that can't be beat. Its also a pretty good deal.
