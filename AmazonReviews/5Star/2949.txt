This arrived beautifully packaged, inside and out, and in just a couple of days.  The bowl itself is absolutely gorgeous and is so elegant sitting on its black and gold cushion--a great combination.  The whole presentation is just perfect for a gift!  I wouldn't hesitate to give it to any of my friends.  In fact, I'm going to order another one for a friend in Wales.<br /><br />There was a slight imperfection on the outside of the bowl, and when I mentioned it to the seller, I was immediately sent a replacement.  Fantastic service with a smile!
