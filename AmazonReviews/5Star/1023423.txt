Came directly to my door two days after I ordered them, on a Sunday. Really good quality, I can stand them being on full blast without any repercussions, although maybe not recommended for too long. Bass isn't too overwhelming, just the right amount of it. Noise barely gets through over music, unless someone is screaming at the top of their lungs, or volume is really low. The only negative thing about them, and its not even a significant issue, is the cord length, but I'm guessing since they are made for performers, I can't really complain about that. Overall. Excellent everything, well worth the amount I paid for them.
