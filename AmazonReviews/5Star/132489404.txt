I had not used Markley strings before but was curious when I read the product description.  Installed on my Gretch hollow body they both feel and sound great.  They do not stretch out of tune as readily as other brands I have used when I use the Bigsby tremolo.  I plan to continue to use this brand with my Gretch and am considering switching to Markley Blue Steel strings for my other guitars as well.
