We have been renting violins from Kennedy since my daughter was 4 and first started with the 1/16 size and have done two exchanges.  They have always been helpful on the phone and have good customer service.  The quality of the violin is excellent.  We eventually plan to use our credit from renting to buy a Kennedy violin once she stops growing so fast.
