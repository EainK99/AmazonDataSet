I have been playing for over 45 years steady. I have owned and still own a high end Martin and various other custom shop Ren Ferguson built Gibsons.<br /><br />This Takamine model stands almost shoulder to shoulder with any of them which is amazing because it was only a small fraction of what those custom high end guitars cost. I have owned it for a while now and put it through it's paces. Used various different string types and gauges on it. For me I found 11-52 works best but it comes with 12-53 guage.<br /><br />It makes a really good everyday working instrument and song writing guitar.<br /><br />The EG340DLX has an outstanding solid bearclaw spruce top that looks as beautiful as it sounds. As time goes by and many hours more of playing time get applied to it the top will surely \\"open up\\" and sound even sweeter.<br /><br />It does have laminated back and sides  BUT instead of a cheaper grade laminate that some manufacture's use, Takamine uses real flame Mahogany veneer sheets on the front and standard mahogany sheets on the back of the laminate construction with formica in between for strength integrity. So this makes it sound better than most laminate back and sides instruments and last longer as well and not be subject to humidity and tempeture changes as easily as solid wood back and sides.<br /><br />The neck is a delight to play,with a 1 3/4\\" nut width, the action was dead on right out of the box. 4/64ths of an inch at the low E string @ the 12th fret and 3/64ths at the high E @ the 12th fret.<br /><br /> The woods used are top grade. The real flame maple binding around the front and back of the body, down the back center strip, around the headstock and on each side of the finger board is flawless and only found on very expensive guitars. The abalone double rosette ring around the sound hole is stunning as well as the abalone inlaid around the top soundboard edging.<br /><br />It's tone is very nice instantly and will only get better with time. The tuners hold tune and work fine.<br /><br />If there are any faults... it's with the ABS string nut and saddle. They look like some kind of synthetic bone but I'm sure they are plastic which does keep it from reaching it's total tone threshold. They work fine but if one was to have the nut and saddle replaced with bone like I did, this guitar would be pro level for any performance.<br />The CP100 under saddle pickup is competent but I have heard better. The TP4T preamp works just fine.<br /><br />In conclusion... this is an excellent bargin for the intermediate player, pro player who doesn't want to risk his or her $10,000.00 vintage instrument on stage or tour and even a beginner that wants a real nice instrument to start on.<br /><br />I'm keeping mine for sure and if nothing else, it's incredible to just look at because it is quite possibly the best looking acoustic guitar I have ever seen.old tune and work fine.<br /><br />If there are any faults... it's with the ABS string nut and saddle.
