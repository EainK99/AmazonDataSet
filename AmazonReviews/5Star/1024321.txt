Ok...so i found this Block Rocker at Costco a few days ago and its the closest model on Amazon. Mine looks identical to this model IPA76A but it says IPA76C on it.  It was on sale for $120.00 and its friggin awesome. Ive used it for 2 parties so far and this thing is loud and clear.  Theres also a free app you could download and you could adjust the EQ on it.  Heres a free tip....download a free Karoke app, turn in the bluetooth& plug in the micophone.....and BAM!!!! You now have a kickin' karoke machine....BOOYAH  YOU'RE WELCOME!!!  Get this device!!!!
