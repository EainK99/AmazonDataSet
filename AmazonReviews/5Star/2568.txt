I have been sold on D&#34;Addario strings ever since they came with my Breed Love guitar 5 years ago. I used to be an &#34;Elixir&#34; only guy. For some reason I would go through those quite frequently and they were more pricey. I have not had this issue with the D&#34;Addario stings. Love the tone and especially the price. I used to get them at my local music store but after I found out how much they were on Amazon, I will never go back. Great value for great quality.
