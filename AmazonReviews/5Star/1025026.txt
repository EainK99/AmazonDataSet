For only having one knob, this is an extremely versatile pedal. You can use it as a buffer, a volume stomp, or to color the tone of your overdrive/distortion. I run it before my drives and set them at low gain so that the saturation comes from the overloaded Napoleon. That way I can get two different tones out of the drives without having to dial the knobs at all. I haven't used it to overdrive a tube amp yet but I bet it sounds awesome. Oh and the graphic is pretty neat too.
