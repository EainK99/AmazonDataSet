I just received the light and have only used it once but I just love it. It is so nice to have 2 lights so I can see the whole book at once instead of having to move the light around. And it is so bright, almost too bright and that is just on the first setting. If there is any flaw that I see it is that I wish the cord to the electric outlet was a little longer. But that is just my opinion.
