the guitar is as I expected. Sound quality is very good.  Very easy on the fingers, considering that the strings are steel, that helps a lot.  ( I had been playing for almost 40 years, and I have 6 other guitars, though this is my first Takamine).<br /><br />I had problem locating the amplifier plug (have another acoustic/electric and the plug is very visible).  This one, the plug is the same as the rear strap hook.  It was plugged with the shipping styro foam that it looks like a part of the strap connector.  I sent an email to the dealer and they responded in less than 8 hours.  My experience with this dealer, ALTO MUSIC, is excellent.<br /><br />The instrument came in a well protected box, already tuned and playable. No need to set it up, and the current price is heavily discounted now.  Very good deal.<br /><br />The package arrived well ahead of the estimated delivery period and I reside overseas.  Once again, AMAZON  did not disappoint.  Thank You.
