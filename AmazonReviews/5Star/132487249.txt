I own several SKB cases for my gear, and own three of this particular size.  I typically load them full of film/TV gear for shoots that require me to fly out of town.  I usually load 60-70 lbs in each case... everything from metal stands, to lights, to cameras.  And they (most likely) get thrown around like crazy by the TSA and airline employees, but after 4 years of frequent traveling, they all work as good as they did new.  No broken latches, and the cases are still airtight after a flight (I have to use the pressure release valve most of the time because the cold air has caused them to actually contract a bit).  I read other reviews about these being poorly built and having bad seals... I'm wondering if they got a defective one or a knockoff.  Mine are all built every bit as good as a Pelican (maybe even a little better).  I'd very much recommend these.
