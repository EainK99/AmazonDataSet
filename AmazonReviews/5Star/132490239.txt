Easy to retrofit into control cavity of P-Bass, adequate space to fit everything. Take note that the pot control posts are just a bit broader than standard and may need replacement knobs.  Take the time to identify the volume pot and the tone pot, then begin the assembly and it should be fine. Adds a stronger output from a stock pickup and a greater depth of tone. It has a beefed up, somewhat fuller classical precision bass sound.
