I didnt buy this from Amazon, I seen it on PRS website first but irregardless this is without a doubt the finest guitar strap I have ever owned.  Is super soft, wreaks of fine quality, superb leather, and craftsmanship.  If you love your guitar and want the best possible strap out there this is it.  Drape your PRS in supple leather goodness.
