I am quite picky about the things that I buy, and I was scared this was going to be a cheap piece of junk, but instead it sounds amazing.  I almost bought the meinl artist addition didgeridoo instead (for $99) but decided to go with this one and I am happy I made the decision. It is great sounding and I won't need to move up until I play this one and practice for several years probably.  I HIGHLY recommend getting the beeswax along with it because after the first 5 minutes of playing, the edge of the didgeridoo started to hurt like it was cutting my upper lip.
