I have played guitar for almost 20 years and have been using a guitar given to me by a friend so I really had nothing else to compare it to. The EC-50 had a lot of great reviews and from the videos I watched sounded like what I was looking for. It did not disappoint, its exactly the right size and weight plus the quality is top notch for its price range. I would recommend this guitar to anyone looking to start playing or even intermediates.<br /><br />As far as the bundle of other stuff, I received everything except the strap in the kit.
