I can't recommend this enough.  I feel like it's one of those things that every bassist should just have.  Despite being such a small scale, it BOOMS when it's plugged in.  This bass has the biggest low end of any of my instruments and the tone is absolutely beautiful.  It can be a bit boomy but that can be dialed down with EQ.  Unplugged, it sounds amazing.  A bit quiet, as all acoustic basses are, but perfect for personal practice.  I've played it acoustically up against a classical guitar and it held its own fairly well.  I've ran it through a Big Muff into my amp and it gives a perfect sound through the distortion.  This bass has a very versatile sound and I can't recommend it enough.  I used to think these were gimmicky, but after having one, I can see Kala really went the extra distance to make a professional quality bass.
