So far though, this is the best backpack I've found and at a low price.<br />I've bought and tried several bags for my current notebook computer home studio setup when traveling like a nomad (which I'm not!), but each one is unique.<br />I wanted a bag that is not cumbersome in weight nor to the components that I have.<br />It does have heavy-padded compartments which is a good one (and a downside one).  The reason for this is that they help protect some delicate components in which at the same time causing the backpack to bulge when putting so many of the components in it.<br />It is very rugged and heavy-duty in which it can last long.<br />I wouldn't consider buying this bag for anything else other than DJ/notebook computer studio equipment, period.<br />This is THE bag for a traveling DJ/studio musician in mind!<br />I will recommend this to anyone who wants to use it for a specific purpose: DJ-ing or portable studio recording.<br />Take care everybody! ;)
