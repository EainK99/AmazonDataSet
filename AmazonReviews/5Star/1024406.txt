if $299 is a steal for such guitar imagine for $125!!?!<br />thats what i paid and it was brand new, never used! the only problem was it had a crack but i could live with that, besides, i kind of liked it like that, it gives it a more vintage look.<br />its a beautiful guitar, i got a whole lot more compliments than my Taylor 210ce worth 1000 bucks.<br />Just buy it.
