I have to go with the rest of the five stars here, this is a great gadget.  I picked one up from Guitar Center this afternoon and had my drums tuned up and sounding great in 90-minutes (put on new heads at the same time).  I am horrid at tuning by ear, and never had any luck with Tension Watch.  I was highly skeptical before giving this a try, I'm now a believer.
