Just what I was looking for and well worth it. The picks make my uke sound like a real  instrument which was shocking and kind of awesome after the last year of near daily practice. The strap is nice quality and doesn't get in the way of play or tuning. It also was a quick answer on getting my uke off the ground so that my just-learning-to-crawl infant won'r be able to knock it out of its stand anymore.
