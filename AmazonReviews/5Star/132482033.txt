This guitar looks and sounds fantastic, I was able to play it right out of the box! It took me a while to get this guitar, I ordered it Thursday morning(2 day shipping option)and it barely got here on Monday (Due to the weekend) but it's all good. It feels and plays astounding, I know I read other posts saying this is a awesome guitar for its price and I have to agree! If you want to start up a collection or begin playing guitar at a reasonable and affordable price, I would highly recommend these Epiphone guitars!
