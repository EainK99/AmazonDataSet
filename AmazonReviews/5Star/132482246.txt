Purchased this Line6 XD-V55 to replace my worn out EV wireless.mic.  The technology has improved since I last bought a wireless.  The new digital generation of wireless no longer have to use compression / expansion circuits to send and receive signal.  This was evident right out of the box...the sound is much more like a wired mic...clear and undistorted with an uncluttered airiness.<br /><br />Put it to work the next day at an outdoor gig.  Very pleased with the performance so far.  It paired with the receiver easily.  No static or dropouts at a proximity of about 60 feet at that gig.  I have yet to use it enough to know the range limit, but the manufacturer claims up to 300 feet.<br /><br />One important thing to note is that in order to shut it off you need to pull a battery.  It opens easily so that is not a big deal and you can put them back in the battery compartment for storage.<br /><br />There are 4 mic models to choose from.  It came set to a Line 6 custom eq model, but my preference is the sm58.  It has a smoother slightly ballsier sound on that setting.  The mic has a nice solid feel to it as well...not plasticy like my old EV...more like a slightly rubberized metal casing...easy to hold on to.<br /><br />All in all I am very happy with the mic.  Price wise it was a good value...less expensive than most of the other digital models on the market today.  I bought it from a local music store since I needed it right away and could not wait for delivery, but the price on Amazon was the same...and about $100 less than many other sellers.<br /><br />I am looking forward to a long and productive relationship with this mic!  Well done Line6.
