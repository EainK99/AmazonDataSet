We have a nice set-up where we have regular Rock Band sessions.  It's really more like karaoke as we just rock out and don't really play the game in RB.<br /><br />I've spent considerable time setting up a nice music playing environment for Rock Band karaoke nights here at the man cave.  We can really rock the house.  Only problem had been that ANY USB mic would over-modulate if the singers would really get on it like they want and should.  All the other instruments sounded great, but the mic would always suffer.  Mind you, this is not your normal RB set up.  We have the house rocking through HUGE speakers in true stereo (NOT DOLBY SURROUND) like you would any cool music set up.  And the singers just could never get on it like in a true stage performance....until now.<br /><br /> You do a little slice and dice on the USB mic cord, a little solder here and there and plug in this bad boy and now there's no more over-modulation issues.  The singers can whale and we can rock the house!  Awesome!<br /><br />USB mics suck for singing.  Get a Dynamic mic that doesn't need phantom power and splice in the digital convertor from the old USB RB mic and you'll be killing it.  Also added a cowbell and a tambourine.  Wicked!  And now no one need hit on the nice mic for those fills.<br /><br />One thing that I haven't been able to fix however is the reverb that the game itself insists on adding to the singer.  It's a bit too much, but I can't fix that as it's in the actual game.  I just make sure to not add any more by any artificial sound settings.  Play your RockBand like you would play your best music files at home and you'll be much happier.  Get the right mic connected correctly and you'll be silly happy.
