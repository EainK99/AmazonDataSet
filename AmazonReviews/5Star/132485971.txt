Just installed them last night in a few minutes. They work perfectly and far exceeded my expectations. Really well designed and functional. The ability to have 8 brightness levels and lots of colors accessible via an included remote is just great!<br />Watching my TV for a few hours that night with these lights turned on really improved the viewing experience.<br />Considering the size of the LED's, they are surprisingly bright. I have them on the second lowest setting and that works well.<br />The only downside I've experienced is that the remote shares some codes with my Pivos Aios media player, so I have to be careful when I aim the remotes.<br />The 16 foot length was almost perfect for my set with only about a foot short of completely encircling it.<br />This is one of the best purchases I've made on line so far. I am totally thrilled with the value, quality, and functionality of these lights, and the fact that it took barely 10 minutes to be up and running was a very pleasant surprise.<br />Follow-up a couple of weeks later..........Still thrilled with the purchase, but, like others, the adhesive tape started to let go in a few places. I fixed it with a bit of Duct tape strategically attached at points of greatest stress. All good now but we'll keep an eye on it. All LED's still working great.
