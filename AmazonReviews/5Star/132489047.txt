This DI box is great. It works for a number of things, and the POT style attenuators per channel really make getting just the right levels a breeze. Audio doesn't seem to be modified EQ-wise when using this unit, and there are mono and ground lift options of course.<br /><br />I use this unit in conjunction with my Zoom H4N in order to record line-level (without it, the levels are way too high). If you're wanting to do the same, put the microphone level on the zoom to 1, then use the 2 knobs on this guy to set your levels, works great!<br /><br />I also have used this to run the sound out of a PC to the soundboard, and it worked great in that application too.<br /><br />It's very solid, and extremely well constructed. I couldn't think of anything more I would expect out of this unit. It was a bit expensive, but a good DI box is expensive even if not stereo.
