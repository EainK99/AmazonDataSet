I just received mine last week. It shipped fast, it is beautiful! I'm a beginner teaching myself, so tuning it was easy with the digital tuner that comes with it.<br />My only complaint is it arrived with one missing fine tuner, I made do by adjusting one string to where I needed it then I switched so I could tune the other. I would suggest watch a lot of YouTube videos on How To adjust and learn your strings & when to use your rosin. You'll need it before you can hear sound on the beginner violin.<br />Wish it came with a book; I'd be ready to go...
