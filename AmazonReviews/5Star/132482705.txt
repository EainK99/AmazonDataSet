Now giving a newly three year old a violin is insane. This violin made the thought a lot easier. Inexpensive= i won't have heart failure when he throws it.  Now opening the box I was excited, and then this case was tiny, and inside is the perfect violin for my son.  He grabbed the bow and nothing. well he doesn't know it needs rosin. the rosin is just fine for tiny.  scratch the top rub bow and ta da happy child now to keep gentle in his mind.
