I choose 5 Stars only on the assumption that this plan will pay if necessary. It came up as an add on option while buying some musical goodie and I thought due to the complexity of what I was purchasing I may want to get this added protection. I am hoping I will not need to use it. Sometimes you go with your gut on which side of the bet you want to take. I don't always get extended warrantees or protection plans, since most of the time, it is in the favor of the seller betting nothing will go wrong within the time period. But I was dealing with a product that had not been out for a real long time, and so rather spontaneously decided to get it. You may want to as well if the warrantee is not real long and you are unsure of a new version of what you are buying. So, it was very simple to get and add on without a bunch of paper work which always used to just &#34;bug&#34; me ~ no feelings of if I leave something off will they weasel out of the protection ~ not happening here I am sure.
