My son wanted to learn the guitar, but with everything else that comes and goes i didn't want to spend alot in it. But at the same time i didn't want to get a piece of junk. This guitar fit both in price and quality. Its not top of the line, but at the same time its not a toy with plastic strings.  It was just right for him. If you are looking for a good cheap guitar to begin with, then you will like this one.
