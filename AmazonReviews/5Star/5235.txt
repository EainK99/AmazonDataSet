I was a little concerned about the plastic clips getting in the way, but I love everything about this strap. Very comfortable, not super thick but the padding is nice and high quality, and it looks nice. Great price, too.<br /><br />Using it on a 12&#34; open back, and I like how it fits in the gig bag as well. Gives the pot a bit extra protection around the bottom.
