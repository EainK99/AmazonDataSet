Amazing strings!. I am still in the process of finding &#34;my set of strings&#34;. I just installed the strings yesterday, so far it has been a great surprise. Medium Light is a nice gauge, though a bit thick for somebody with small fingers like me (girly hands lol) but it's great. Just matter of getting used to it. The bass sound is so rich and the high E sounds crispy clear. I totally love it!! My next purchase will definitely be a set of Earthwood Lights, just to give it a shot.
