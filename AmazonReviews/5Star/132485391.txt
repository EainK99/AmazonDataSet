Worked great , the shipment and price was just super..great value  !!! different strokes for different folks, this Maracas worked well for the purpose i needed it for..no complaints or technicality encountered on my end....I just needed a &#34;Maracas&#34; sound  to add live percussion to my songs , its really how you play it that matters not necessarily a bunch of technical analysis of this instrument  ,,,
