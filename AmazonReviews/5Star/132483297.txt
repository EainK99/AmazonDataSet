Everything about this pedal shouts 'well designed and made'. It seems to be indestructible, but the action is smooth. I am tempted to compare this to a [[ASIN:B0002II8A4 Ludwig L201 Speed King Single Bass Drum Pedal]].<br /><br />Personally I do not believe you can draw a direct comparison. Yes, they are both are direct drives (although the Ludwig uses an actual strap), and both are light and seem to float. However, the feel of this one is a little different. For one thing it's much lighter under your foot. Plus you can adjust it in more places like the footboard height. However, if you are more comfortable with the single board design of the Ludwig it will take a little getting use to the separate heel plate of this one.<br /><br />Since I play strictly heel down this is perfect for my playing style. I am sure heel up players will also like the light, responsive action too. To me it feels like an extension of my foot, but with more power than an Axis pedal, which has the same basic feel.<br /><br />I love the foot plate itself. My foot does not slide on it, nor does it ride up on the board the way I seem to wind up on other pedals. That, to me, makes it worth it all by itself. Another thing I love is right out of the box the only adjustment I needed to make was to tighten the spring a bit. I prefer a very stiff action because I play off the head and actually use beater rebound. I think for most drummers this would be near perfect out of the box with - perhaps - some minor tweaking. I believe that speaks more highly of the overall design than how the factory default adjustments are. Every part seems to have balance and smoothness as the two main design criteria. If that is so, then being bulletproof is the third one.<br /><br />Finally, this ships with a sturdy carrying case, which is yet another nice touch. To me this may prove to have the same long life cycle as the Speed King because the design is classic and I cannot find a single thing to wish for. You cannot say that about many pedals.ay that about many pedals.
