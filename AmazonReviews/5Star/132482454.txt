Pros:<br />Sounds great<br />Has lots of character in both sound and appearance<br />Great low price<br />Plays great<br /><br />Cons:<br />Danelectros have an inherently less solid/robust feel, allowing for low cost. But they sound better than any guitar in my opinion, they play great, they look cool, and I have never had problems with reliability.<br /><br />I compared this to much more expensive bases, but they all seemed boring and they lacked tonal character. I wouldn't trade this for a $4000 bass if I had the choice (and could only have one bass)
