I ordered 2 of these 12-packs, and they arrived in about 2 days. 2x original Fender packaging (small bag with Fender folded tag stapled over the top - all inside a small padded envelope. Free shipping. Perfect.  As for the picks themselves:<br /><br />I used to use heavy, delrin picks for picking accuracy. However I discovered that I preferred the nice, snappy release of the celluloid material - especially on a lighter pick. I now use either of the top corners of a medium celluloid to pick, and I get all the control/accuracy plus snappy release.  My last batch were the White Moto, which I loved. The abalone appear to have similar flex and release characteristics, but haven't played with them yet.
