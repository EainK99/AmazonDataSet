Probably good enough for a club, but I'm not blasting music THAT loudly in my living room<br /><br />  So far, I've run this projector for about six hours total, in about four sittings.  My six-year-old loves the thing.  He and his little cousin have occasional dance parties, and I get the feeling that this will be coming along with him next time he goes to visit.<br />  It's a small unit:  You're not going to be rocking the Fleet Center with this thing.  And yes, it only has red and green, and only a few programs.  But it's a whole lot of fun to watch, and the lasers are bring enough to show up on my walls and ceiling even with my lights on.  You can vary the speed of the prism's movement, from fairly hyperactive to full stop.  You can also turn on a strobe setting which is pretty fun.  My favorite setting is the sound-activated setting.  The lights seem to react somewhat randomly to the sound.  I just wish the unit's microphone was a bit more sensitive  The music has to be really loud or really close for it to trigger the lights.  Other than that, this unit works great.  I know it's cliche, but I can't wait to put on dark side of the moon and stare at the ceiling for a while...<br /><br />I received a complimentary sample of this stage light, allowing me to offer my honest review.  I hope my review, and the video attached, is helpful in making your decision.
