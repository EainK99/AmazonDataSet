I've had a string set on my old German violin for over 3 years now. The tone has faded a bit, but it still has the growl of the deep bass sound you would not expect from a violin. I changed  the bridge and I have a metal Thomastik tailpiece which doesn't put a bend on the ball end of the string so no stress there. The action is very high for string clearance and I cut the bridge very thick to accommodate the thickness of the G string..<br />I have not tried the Thomastik octave strings, but they cost more than twice as much. I suspect because they are steel they will be brighter. The Sensicores are perlon and wonderfully flexible like gut strings, but surprisingly bright for a low pitched string. That might give you a clue as to the playing characteristics of these 2 string sets.
