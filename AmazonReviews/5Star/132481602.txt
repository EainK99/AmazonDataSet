I got these headphones to replace my late ATH-M30s. I loved my M30s, but they had several drawbacks, such as an uncoiled 11ft cable and that it didn't fold. I also had to supplement the pads of the M30s (with cottonballs, how cheap of me) so that my ears didn't touch the hard plastic driver (Painful over extended periods of use).<br /><br />The choice of color was purely out of luxury (like others have said).However, the color in the picture is not a good representation of the real color. On amazon it looks very dark and dull, but in person, it is bright and glossy. Think Fiesta red but a smidge darker. Definitely a bad* looking set of headphones<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Extremely comfortable. Any part of the headphone that touches your head is soft but tight fitting so they don't float down your head. The padding is some sort of Pleather.<br />-Great sound clarity. This kind of statement is hard to quantify without an amplitude scope, but in general the low end is clearer than before and the high end is a lot clearer, no more hissing cymbals on Keith Moon's drums. The mids aren't as prominent as on these as M30s<br />-Better overall construction. Now that I have a basis for comparison, my M30s feel thin, cheap, and loose. These headphones are thick and solid. The all the swivel points and adjustments are very fluid and feel very high quality.<br />-Convenient and portable. These things are mega flexible and the coiled cable keeps everything tidy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Heat. The thick padding on the cups is unfortunately like a wool sweater for my ears. They don't get super hot, but they do warm up a little faster.<br />-Leakage. A little bit too much sound slips out to let this point go untouched. not incredibly bad though, I haven't received comments on the leak yet.<br /><br />All in all, Audio-Technica has re-affirmed my support for them with these awesome headphones.
