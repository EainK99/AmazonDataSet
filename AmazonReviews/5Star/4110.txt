I bought this as a gift for my husband who is learning to play guitar.  He really likes the smoothness of the picks.  He also is enjoying the great variety of thicknesses as he learns different techniques. He hasn't chosen a favorite &#34;all purpose&#34; thickness yet which is why it's nice to have the choices.<br /><br />I think this pick set is a great value and it even comes in a storage case.  The lid on the case is not as secure as I would like and it can't be stored in the guitar case sideways because the lid will come off in that position.  He ended up leaving one of the pieces of tape on the case and opens it in a clamshell like way.<br /><br />Warning: the picks smell a little weird, so you may want to keep the lid off the case for a day or two to let the smell fade a little.<br /><br />*I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.*
