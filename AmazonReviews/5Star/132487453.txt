Purchased this product for my youngest daughter who is starting to pick up the piano. This is a great teaching tool for beginners and i think she has played it everyday since getting it.  We are very pleased that one its pink which is her fav. color and its got an awesome mic that she can sing and play with. She loves it and i am more than pleased. I highly recommend as a gift for someone who is learning their way into music.
