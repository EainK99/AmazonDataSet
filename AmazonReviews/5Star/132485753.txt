I have over 200 guitars in my collection which includes everything from a 1961 EPIPHONE E-312-T (Hooker) ZEPHYR to Gibson custom shops, Fender Americans, Etc. ETc., and I just keep coming back<br />to this inexpensive Ibanez semi-hollow as one of my favorite players.<br />To top it off, I bought this as a second (something about a finish flaw that I can't find, and really don't care about anyway).<br />The guitar size is close to a 339 which is the little brother to the Dot.<br />The guitar is light, and the bout is just the right size. The neck is \\"U\\" shaped (I usually like \\"V\\"), and it is amazingly easy to fret. The standard pickups do a great job, and you don't feel like changing them out. This guitar is actually a striped down 93 with hotter pickups. I have two AM93's which are much heavier, and you get to pay another $200.00 for fancy bindings, finish, and covered pickups that you do feel like replacing.<br />If you were making any changes to the guitar, I would start with the stock die cast tuners, which<br />is typical of the first (and maybe only) upgrade to a great guitar.<br />Ibanez hit it out of the park with this one.<br />Also, the World Tour EG20D is a great bag for the AM series guitars.
