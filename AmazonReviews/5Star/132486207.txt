I'm thrilled with how well this stand has met my very specific needs.<br /><br />Due to disability, I have to sit down when I play but, unfortunately, my old 2-tier X-stand holds my upper keyboard so high above the lower one that it blocks my view of the audience (even though I'm by no means short, at 6'1).<br /><br />Thankfully, this Z-style stand has fantastic vertical adjustability and I'm able to set it so that my upper keyboard sits just an inch or two above the lower one. Eye contact is important when you're performing on stage, and with this stand I can finally see over the top of my gear again.<br /><br />With both of my keyboards in place, this stand is truly solid as a rock. Unlike my X-stand, there's hardly any rocking motion when I'm playing with this stand (and I play very passionately).<br /><br />Out of the box, putting it together was only mildly troublesome. It's just a question of figuring out which piece is which, and which easy-turn knob fits in which hole, etc. Nothing too complex, but certainly a bit more involved than assembling a typical X-stand. However, once the initial set-up is complete, the Z-stand really shines...it's very simple to adjust the height, width, and 2nd-tier angle to match your personal preference. The versatility of this stand is remarkable!<br /><br />For transportation, it's obviously not as quick and easy as closing up an X-stand, but if you disconnect the two  crossbars, you instantly have four separate pieces that can lie down flat. Remove the upper tier arms, and the footprint shrinks even further. You probably wouldn't need to do this all the time, but if you were to completely dismantle the stand, you could carry the entire thing in an average sized sports bag. It's well designed in that respect.<br /><br />It's more expensive than the traditional X-stands of course, but I think it's well worth the investment for the additional stability and versatility it provides.<br /><br />All in all, I LOVE THIS STAND! I've bought four or five different keyboard stands over the years, but I would buy this one again in a heartbeat. It's my new favorite.<br /><br />*************<br />FYI, I also bought an [[ASIN:B0010GNU9Q On Stage KSA7575 Universal Keyboard Stand Microphone Attachment Bar]], so that I can mount a microphone boom directly onto the rear of the stand. I'm happy to report that the round attachment fits perfectly and securely into the square tubing of this stand. In addition, I also ordered an [[ASIN:B0007SL86A On Stage QK2B Microphone Clip Quick Release]] so that I can remove the boom arm with just a quick push of a button, rather than having to rotate the whole thing around and around. It works like a charm!<br /><br />That's it! I hope you find this review helpful.
