I may have just started playing the tin whistle last year, but I have searched high and low for a whistle like this.  I have played Clark's Meg and Sweetone, a full set of Generations, a Feadog in brass and Feadog Pro in nickle, my sister's set of Waltons, and finally a Dixon polymer....  I wish I had started with the Dixon!<br /><br />This whistle is a very solid performer, with many pros and very few cons.  The sound quieter than my Feadog Pro (and thankfully far less shrill), falling somewhere between a Sweetone and a Generation in volume.  It is almost pure clear drop with just a hint of chiff on the lowest notes.  There is very little breath needed to play this whistle, and octave jumps are easy to achieve and relatively hard to shrill, so long as one's fingers are properly placed.  Finger spacing is fairly standard, feeling similar to the spread of a Clarke Sweetone.  I have played as long as an hour without any clogging issues to mention.<br /><br />Construction wise, the walls of this whistle are thicker than I was expecting.  This makes it fairly durable, and the provided plastic case is perfect for carrying this whistle around in my purse (which I was afraid to do with my Sweetone or Generation, as I have already gone through three in a year due to crowded buses leading to passenger flattened whistles).  However, I imagine sitting on this whistle in a pocket or falling on it in a crowd would still result in a very broken whistle.<br /><br />The polymer feels extremely light when playing.  I find the lightness to be a pro and a con.<br /><br />On the plus side, I can play longer as my hands don't cramp as quickly as when holding aloft a solid nickle whistle.  On the down side, I sometimes feel like I might drop the Dixon.  (I haven't dropped it yet, but the feeling is there.)  Perhaps the weakest point of the Dixon is that this model drops out of hearing in even the slightest breeze.  Which, of course, requires one to deftly dance perform the \\"wind dance\\" to keep the pesky element at their backs if playing outdoors.<br /><br />Overall, I love this whistle!  The Dixon sounds great, the construction is solid, and it is carried everywhere with me with very little fear of breaking it in my daily travels.  I am actually contemplating buying another for my youngest sister if she shows any interest in the whistle, as I think it would make a great beginner's instrument.  From the haunting tones of a slow ballad, to the fastest jig I can manage, this whistle handles exceptionally well.
