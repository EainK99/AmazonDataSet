I love using the Tascam DR-5 to record myself playing and singing with my guitar.  It allows me to easily hear where I need improvement and the sound is really great, way better than my old cassette recorder and easier than trying to record directly to my computer.  Once you familiarize yourself with the menus and buttons it's a pleasure to use.  I only wish the built-in speaker was a little more powerful.  I just use headphones to listen to the playback.  I thought when I purchased this recorder that I could over-dub voice on music etc., but I can't.  One great feature is the sound FX that gives you the option of sounding like your in a hallway or auditorium.  Over all, this was a great purchase.
