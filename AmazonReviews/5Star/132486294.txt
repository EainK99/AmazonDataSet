If you are looking to purchase this rack, do so!! I got mine here at amazon.com for an unbelievable price at $11.99!!! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT! I'm using mine to house my recording computer and hard drive, although you could put way heavier items on this.  The metal is thick and very strong with little flex at all! Nice heavy rack shelf.  Would be great to hold guitar pedals for a rack unit and would be able to handle the road well. It doesn't slide out, but if you are looking for a strong shelf, look no further.
