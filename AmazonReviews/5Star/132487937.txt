I've bought several of these, for Internet remote broadcast kits I use in producing high school football remotes.  Our announcers use broadcast headsets that need to plug into our headphone distribution amplifier.  I needed to extend the reach; but these guys are animals - cables get yanked, pulled, twisted - you know!  Their headsets are falling apart; but these cables look just as good as when we bought them.
