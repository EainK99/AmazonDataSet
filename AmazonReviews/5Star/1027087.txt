I originally bought a pair of these as a Christmas present for my dad. After trying them out I decided to get a pair for myself. They have a great clear sound. They have a perfect balance of lows, mids, and highs. I run sound for live music at my church, so I am very picky about how my headphones sound. I couldn't have asked for better headphones.
