Chances are if you are reading this review, you have read far, and I'm sure I won't tell you anything that you haven't figured out by now, but here is my two-cents worth:<br /><br />I just received these phones today (9/24/2013) and I have been using them for about 6 hours as of the time of this review. I am very impressed with these Sony's. The sound reproduction is excellent, and there is no distortion at high volumes. The lows are there as they were intended, and the mids and highs are crystal clear. It is also worth noting that they are fairly comfortable. They warm my ears a little bit, but nothing bad. Otherwise once you have them adjusted, you can hardly tell that they are on.<br /><br />I consider myself a bit of an audiophile, and I enjoy good sounding music. These 7506's are the first that I looked at, followed by the V6's. These isn't much of a difference for the \\"average\\" listener, but the V6's do offer more on the low end and are a little more \\"warm\\" in that regard. The 7506's are sharper. Overall, I prefer the 7506 more, and they are really just a newer version of the V6. At the time I purchased these, the 7506 was about $15-$20 cheaper, so based on what I heard testing, I went with these. If you are debating the 7506 vs. the V6, I would go with whatever is cheaper at the time. For under $100, these are arguably the BEST you can buy.<br /><br />If you are wondering about all of the \\"break-in\\" stuff, I personally don't believe in it, but everyone has their own opinion. To \\"break-in\\" any headphone, I just use them how I normally intend to use them. Overtime, you can pick out minor differences with listening time, but that is just your ears getting used to the sound. Break-in or not is up to you, again I don't believe in 100 or more hours of breaking-in with special tracks, just use them how you will use them.<br /><br />I use these on my computer, Sony CD burner, iPod classic, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, as well as my old LXI series stereo from Sears with a separate amp and EQ. The best sound comes from either the CD burner or the stereo, but those have more power output compared to a computer or iPod. However, these headphones also work well when powered by a computer or iPod. However, if you are using these with MP3's or others of the like, you MUST make sure that you have a good quality file. 128kbps is the MINIMUM! If you have the room, go for 320kbps MP3 or a \\"lossless\\" file. These phones will ruin a poor quality file. The best way is to either rip a CD in 320 or lossless or buy high-quality MP3. I don't encourage illegally downloading music, but if you do, that's your choice. Just make sure it is a good, large file or you will regret it.<br /><br />Well, I think that should finish my review. I hope you found it helpful and if there are any other questions I haven't answered, ask me.eparate amp and EQ.
