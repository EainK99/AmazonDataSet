I've had these for around 6 months now and could not be more pleased.  I have owned comparable level AKG 601, Denon, Sony and Sennheiser headphones.  I loved the Denon's, but they broke at their weak point.  The AKG's are great, but they are open and bother everyone else in the house when I use them.  These have sound quality as good or better than any other set I have had, they are very comfortable and have a good build quality.  I strongly recommend the DT 770 PRO's to anyone who wants a high quality closed headphones at a reasonable price.
