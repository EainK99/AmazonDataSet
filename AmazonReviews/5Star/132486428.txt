This is an excellent keybord.  It hooks up without an issue.  I do not like the position the tablet sits in on the keyboard, the tablet falls off.  Also the position of the tab that hold the keyboard on as a case is in the wrong position as it is centered on the spacebarof the keyboard ... not smart.
