When I got this Fender amp and started playing it, I was blown away by the clarity of the sound, the punch and the hassle-free adjustments. I simply wanted an amp, no overkill emulator-tone-creator-50-effects-in-one sort of deal.<br /><br />I got this when I played lead in a country band, but I love it even more for playing classic rock. Compared to other amps of about the same dimension, the Fender Frontman is lighter than I had expected. I love the built-in spring reverb (an actual spring), and the inputs and outputs are just perfect for me.<br /><br />For computer recording, I go through a cheap Behringer mixer that can handle instruments and microphones in one. I have to say, this amp made making music fun again for me.<br /><br />So no matter what vintage Fender you are playing, for my budget, this amp was the best choice (tried a couple of others). And unlike my Fender half-stack, I can at least play the Frontman inside my house without breaking stuff (although I've only gone past Volume 3 once was, and that made the chandelier shake).
