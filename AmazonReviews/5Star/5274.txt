My Lute Hole soundhole cover/feedback reducer arrived today (right on time), and actually looks better than I expected. It's more solid than the photos suggested, and only took less than half a minute to install in my Taylor 114. Being the &#34;light&#34; feedback reducer, I managed to get some feedback when I played through an amp, but it took some effort to do so. Unplugged, the soundhole cover didn't adversely affect the sound of the guitar at all. And did I mention that it looks great?<br /><br />If you get one of these, be sure to follow the directions for installing it. Angle it in carefully, don't force it, and use a guitar pick to compress the foam gasket on the back as you go. No fuss, no problems (as long as your guitar has a 4&#34; sound hole. Measure it before you order).
