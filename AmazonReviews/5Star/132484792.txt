I first used the tester hours before a big concert tour that came through our theatre. The electrician with the tour tried to take control of the house system with his console and suddenly nothing worked properly. Right out of the box the tester proved its worth. It made tracking down the problem in the signal flow easier than ever. In minutes we found the issue and got everything working again. Like the description says, it can even work as a mini console to work out your fixture patch and even test conventional dimmers without needing an actual console. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone I work with.
