I play these (9-42) on a Fender Strat with a solid rosewood neck and Fender Custom Shop Fat 50's pickups.  I've tried other, more expensive strings but these sound the best to me for a vintage style sound.  Other brands and styles of strings may be cheaper or last longer but these are my pick for the best tonal strings for that Strat style sound.<br /><br />For most pickers that play on a regular basis, changing strings isn't a big problem.  I change mine AT LEAST once a week and sometimes every day.  So, I don't really understand the &#34;corrodes too quickly&#34; statements.  Obviously, these pickers are using their strings a lot longer than I do.  I've tried the coated, dipped and extended life strings but they all sound substandard to plain-old strings.  They might last longer but you are sacrificing tone.  An electric pickup works on vibration and magnetic energy.  The longer your strings vibrate, the longer sustain you encounter.  If you take a string that sounds good and install a sleeve on it, the sustain will diminish slightly.  Thus your tone will diminish slightly.  For some, this isn't really an issue and they compensate with expensive gear.  However, nothing beats the clean sound of freshly installed plain strings (in my humble opinion).<br /><br />In the end, pick what you think is going to work best for you.  Personally, the Dean Markley Blue Steels work excellent for me on my Strats.
