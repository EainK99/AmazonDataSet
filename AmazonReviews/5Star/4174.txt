This PA system is great for everything from personal to professional use.  The sound is fantastic... perfect bass and can get quite loud without any distortion.<br /><br />You can connect a variety of audio sources to the speaker using the inputs on the back as well as stream audio via Bluetooth using the built-in receiver.  A downloadable app allows you to mix the volume levels and adjust things like reverb for each input.  The reverb settings (tested on Android) have a bunch of presets like &#34;small room&#34;, &#34;warm theater&#34;, &#34;concert hall&#34;, and &#34;cathedral&#34;, to name just a few (see the attached screenshot for the complete list).  I love adding some reverb so it sounds like I am in a large club, and this speaker and app does a great job of emulating that sound.  Since you can control the settings for each input separately, it allows you to get the perfect sound when you combine multiple inputs.<br /><br />On the rear of the speaker, there are two combo inputs where you can connect a balanced or unbalanced mic, instrument, or line-level signal using an XLR or 1/4&#34; connector.  There is also a 1/8&#34; line-level AUX-in port.  There is a Monitor Out jack for connecting powered loudspeakers or a subwoofer.<br /><br />There is a Feedback Destroyer button, which is said to &#34;hunt down offending frequencies and destroys feedback to maximize gain&#34;.  If you don't want to use the app, you can adjust a few audio settings on the rear as well, including reverb and equalizer presets.  A large volume level knob on the rear allows you to quickly adjusting the master volume without using the app.<br /><br />A+ sound and features on this PA system.  If you play your own instrument, this is the perfect companion for performing at home or on the road.
