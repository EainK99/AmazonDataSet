BLOWN AWAY. Yup.  I was originally hesitant to buy this because of the specialized reviews who felt that there was not enough deep end for a male voice.  Well, I had to EQ out some depth because it sounded so big to me.  I am pleasantly surprised by this mic and I am very happy I got it. My previous mic was an MXL V69M EDT MOGAMI Edition and the AKG just feels better in every way. It's certainly sounds more quiet too.  Love how it feels. Wow I'm sold.  Stoked. Tested it out with a soft spoken piece of layered female lyrics and it was silky smooth, easy to mix.  I had plenty there to tailor the sound.  VERY HAPPY.  It's so nice to feel confident about a product.
