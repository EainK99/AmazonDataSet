Great board for one man show, takes a bit getting use to. Navigation needs improvement, but sounds and rhythms or really good. Easy access to primary function. With a little time this board has proven to be great for solo sets, Praise and worship etc. I don't have to worry about a drummer anymore the patterns are on point
