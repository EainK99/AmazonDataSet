I was in the middle of a rehearsal when my g string started to unravel.  Two years of practices and performances finally did it in.  Only took a couple of days to get the new one and put it on. Gave a beautiful, resonant tone overall. You would never think replacing one string would do so much good for the overall tone of a viola.
