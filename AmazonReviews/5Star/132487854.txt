The AA50-DEC is an AA40-DEC with wood (maple) binding on the neck and body instead of ABS plastic, so all the reviews for the<br />AA40-DEC apply here. I own a few Austin AA40's and AA50's of different models including an AA50-DEC blem purchased elsewhere, and they are very high quality guitars for the money. The only problem I've had with any of them were a string buzz caused by a slightly<br />high fret, so I'd suggest you contact the seller and have them guarantee they checked the setup and found no buzzes before purchasing. You will love playing this guitar.
