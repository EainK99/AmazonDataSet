These Francois et Mimi Bluetooth Sports Headphones are so comfortable to wear and have an easy to use design. I have tried several different headphones before and the ear pieces were hard to keep in your ear and uncomfortable. These are amazing! It took me a second to put them on and they actually stayed on.<br /><br />It was very easy to pair. Just hold down the power button on the headsets for a few seconds until the indicator flashes blue and red. Then turn on the Bluetooth on your phone and click search devices. It will show up as F & M. Then click it to pair it and your ready to go.<br /><br />I started off making a phone call with it and the sound quality was great. I didn't have any interruptions or breakage in my call and they heard me perfectly. It has a volume up and volume down button to easily control the sound.<br /><br />I then set up Pandora on my phone to listen to music and it sounded great on these headphones. I was able to get a lot of cleaning done and they didn't fall off once or get in the way.<br /><br />What's in the package:<br />Bluetooth Headphones<br />Micro-USB Charging Cables<br />User manual<br /><br />** This product was received at no cost for review and inspection purposes, No compensation for a positive review was provided.
