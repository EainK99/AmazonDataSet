Great little mixer. It provided 48v phantom to my Shure SM7B and clear powerful sound. Much better then those USB to XLR sticks that are out there. You can add a little EQ as well. USB powered! You do have to crank it up fully to get the boost on my Shure SM7B mic but it doesn't add noise and eliminates the need to boost the audio in post.
