This stand is well made, fully adjustable and sturdy, the only issue I see with this stand is the flat platform the laptop sets on, the edges are not buffed out and not smooth,,, that is easily accomplished on your own with a buffing wheel and a drill, but it really should be done from the manufacturer... the laptop sets freely on the mount with no supplied strap and locking mechanism for the laptop,,, rubber feet will keepit from sliding off when tilted.
