I had this years ago and had to sell when I lost my job.  While I kept 3 guitars, this is the one I missed the most.  With the Strat neck, it allows me to play electric without plugging in.  The price was great on this as I've searched local stores and Ebay.  It feels good to have this back in the fold.  It's also updated with a built in tuner; BONUS!  The seller was really quick with regular delivery.<br />All in all, a great guitar, great seller, great transaction.  Good stuff.
