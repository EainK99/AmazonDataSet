Ever stare at something for a while, coveting it and it wasn't quite what you thought it would be?  Don't worry about that happening with this.  It's the real deal.  Great tone, great playability.  It's a no-nonsense rock machine.  I opted for this two pickup model, because I wanted the flexibility of the neck pickup.  If you're on the fence, you can probably do without the neck pickup.  I find that the bridge pickup has everything I really need.
