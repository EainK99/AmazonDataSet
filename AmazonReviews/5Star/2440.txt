As a female musician who stands about 5' 2&#34;, it can be hard finding high-quality leather straps that are both affordable and fit to my frame. For over 15 years, I've had to cut and re-stitch all of my leather straps to make them small enough for me. This &#34;youth size&#34; strap fits me perfectly! Albeit, on it's smallest setting but I'm very thankful either way. Levy's is a great brand and the strap is sure to last a long time.
