I have been looking for a solution for my headphone storage issue for some time now and this is precisely what I was looking for!  Previously, I had been looking at headphone stands but always felt that they never seemed sturdy enough to hold my pair of Grado cans.  I finally came across these and they were delivered today.  To me this product was well worth the money.  The clamp itself is all metal with the only non-metal parts being the knob that turns the screw to tighten the clamp and the hard rubber (not plastic) piece that actually holds supports the headphone band.  This solution keeps my headphones close at hand and makes my desk look so much cleaner in terms of storage.
