This Guitar is absolutely unbelievable!!! It showed up triple packed and in awesome condition. The neck is super fast with jumbo frets, which helps me play better,not to mention, I got it for the best deal on the net.It showed up with a nice low action and just needed the intonation set and slightly tuned. I have an original randal Dime warhead amp and it sounds monstrous thru it,with so many sounds and options.The pickups are super hot n crisp and the middle small EMG really gives it that clean strat sound.!!Now lets talk about the finish..OMFG!!!! It is really a piece of artwork and prob the coolest looking guitar I have ever seen!!!I knew it was sharp but until you open the case and see it for the first time up close.You have no idea just how badass this Guitar really is..I'm very spoiled with lots of drums,basses and guitars.Yet the mab1 rolls them up and smokes em'all..Buy it,you wont be disappointed..Funny story:= I name all my instruments,so with it being the Batio sig model I figured,,Mr.Bates..Then when I went out to jam with my friend and he said,\\"so this is the master,eh\\", We both looked at each other and said hahah master-bates..So naturally..I named him \\"Norman\\"  ie:psycho..classic!!!!lol
