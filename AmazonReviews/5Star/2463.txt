Wow I play a lot of guitar this is a great little guitar for the money has awesome resonance And the overall sound quality is superior to other guitars of its class. This guitar has that nice twange you look for in an acoustic for southern styles of music but it also has that smooth classical sound you need for a more sophisticated piece!! The gig bag and stand are just an added bonus I would have paid the same price just for the guitar without the other stuff now that I have heard the quality!!
