Cabinet has a great sound and projects a great tone.<br />The Celestion Seventy 80 is bright but after about 50 hours, the speaker breaks in and gets the brown sound most guitarists desire from their tone.<br />Works great as an extension cabinet for my Blackstar HT Soloist 60 and with my Orange Jim Root tiny terror head.
