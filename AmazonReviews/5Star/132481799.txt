I have a whole house intercom that is 17 years old.  The &#34;Press to talk&#34; buttons were getting terrible -- when you pressed the button you heard more loud static than voice.  I tried WD-40 and it helped for about a day, then the problem returned.<br /><br />A few weeks ago I sprayed Deoxit into the contacts and the problem was completely cured, and remains cured.  The buttons are totally quiet when pressed -- no static at all.  We can use the intercom again!<br /><br />This is an excellent product for cleaning oxidized contacts.
