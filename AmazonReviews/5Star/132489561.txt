After my old pair of JVC headphones mysteriously broke (they just stopped working... no visible wear or tear and no disconnected wires on the inside of the headphones after I took them apart, and they wouldn't work in any device), I decided to cough up the $160 and buy this pair after hearing so many good reviews of it.<br /><br />I was, and still am, impressed at the incredible sound quality these headphones boast. Everything sounds so crisp and clear. It's hard to describe how good these headphones sound, but I suppose you could say that they produce sounds that are true to how they actually sound. The bass is strong, the midtones are very clear, and the highs are defined. Every song genre sounds good with these headphones, not just songs heavy in one range of noise.<br /><br />These are also extremely durable, so I have a good feeling I'll be having these for a long time. These are rather expensive considering the price of headphones the majority of people buy, but considering the audio quality you get, you get what you pay for. I would thoroughly recommend these headphones to anyone who is looking for something a high end but still quite affordable.
