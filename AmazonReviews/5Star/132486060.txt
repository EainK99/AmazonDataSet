I ordered BUZZ-OFF. A big believer on getting to know your instrument (Guitar). Well, I checked all my new inexpensive, good quality guitars. All 3 had high fret bars at the top of the neck, middle and lower frets. After watching the video and how to level your frets with BUZZ-OFF (on youtube), I was able to lower the high frets, adjust and tune-up my guitars. Man, what a big difference. When U start hearing the true sound of a well tuned guitar, you will enjoy learning and playing more.
