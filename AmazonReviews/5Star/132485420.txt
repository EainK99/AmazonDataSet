Brilliant headphones. Didn't buy from Amazon, cant remember at all where it was from because i got them 6 years ago.  They still work perfectly which is unheard of in the headphone world. Recently purchased these [[ASIN:B002Z9JWZS Shure HPAEC840 Replacement Ear Cushions For SRH840 Headphones]] as replacement pads because mine were almost entirely cracked through and became uncomfortable after an hour of use, and the difference is unbelievable.  Anybody that owns these headphones should get these replacement pads.  They're much more comfortable and completely eliminate discomfort when wearing for 2-3+ hours at a time.<br /><br />I will be buying another pair of these the second these wear out.  I've gotten far more than my moneys worth unhappy and would recommend them to anyone and everyone.
