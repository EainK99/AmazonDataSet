I've had this bag for 18 months. It's seen lots of transport (no airplanes) and has stood up remarkably well--actually looks today like it did when I bought it. I have used it with larger and smaller acoustic and electric guitars and all have fit--Fender Strats, a Tele, Stratocoustic, Harmony 12-string, Guild D-35, Dean Acoustic-Electric---all have fit. Dreadnoughts are snug, though it remains adequately serviceable and provided needed protection. Padding is actually pretty good (not for airports--NOTHING is adequate for airports!). Multiple handles, back pack straps as well, so easy to grab and to carry. Two good-sized zipped pockets. For the dough, I haven't seen anything better. It has worn well with me and I'm not easy on my equipment. No labels on it, so you can dress it up with your own logo. Four stars plus, maybe 5, now that I think of how it has served me.
