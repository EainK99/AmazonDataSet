loooove it.  Also.  the picture kind of makes it look like there is a white finish on the back, but there isnt....thankfully.  you will not be disappointed with this product.  I like the black strings.  I bought the Aquila replacement, but havent changed them yet.  As long as you dont mind retuning often,  theyre pretty good.
