Our apartment has super thin walls, even THIS violin (unplugged) minus a heavy metal mute will get me some knocks on the wall. However, with a metal mute I can play until my hands fall off and no one says a word. I. LOVE. THIS. The bow is heavy, I don't know how others feel about it, but it's noticeably heavier to me, like they made it out of a black hole. I've put it aside for an emergency, but I can't use it very long. It has a problem holding a tune, even with peg drops and better strings, but I don't mind tuning in before I start to play undisturbed for long periods of time. If you need your practice (hoo boy, I do) and you live in an apartment, get the metal mute and get this violin and use your old bow.
