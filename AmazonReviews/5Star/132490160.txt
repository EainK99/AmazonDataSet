These pads did wonders for my ATH-M50's... They are so much softer and nicer to wear under extended periods of time and they space the ears for the actual speakers more nicely..<br /><br />These are a Great Upgrades and the best Replacement pads.. Don't buy the standard pads they crack and just become worthless.<br /><br />//Florian
