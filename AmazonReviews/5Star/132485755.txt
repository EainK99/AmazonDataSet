I'm a DJ and for my Karaoke shows I was using the Voco Pro 3300 and they take 9V rechargeable and are constantly cutting out on me so I would have my corded as backup and for large group sing alongs... these said they take AA rechargeable and will last longer and they do I charged them fully and they lasted through two shows which = 13 hours with no problems and now the 3300 are my backup for me to use and speak on or for larger sing alongs... and everyone loves the Bling and I have my backup 3300's for those that don't want the Bling.  AA rechargable batteries are also much easier to find and everybody carries them them.
