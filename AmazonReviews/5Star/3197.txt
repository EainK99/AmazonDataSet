Absolutely love these, they're probably not the most &#34;accurate&#34; studio monitors out there, as other reviewers have noticed, but at the sub-$100 price point, I would take these over a comparable M-Audio any day. The packaging was exceptional, and the inclusion of bass pads was a fantastic touch, but take note; THESE DO NOT COME WITH BALANCED TRS CABLES. If you're looking to do some serious DAW related work on these bad boys, a balanced TRS cable set would be absolutely necessary, but alas, they left it out. It includes an Aux cord, Unbalanced RCA connectors and Wiring, but no TRS cables. This is nit-picky I know, but it was a slight disappointment.<br /><br />Regardless, these have fantastic audio reproduction once you find your sweet spots, and the bass is lacking BUT accurate. I see a lot of other reviewers who complained about a lack of bass, and these people are also usually the ones who bought these to be Multimedia speakers INSTEAD of reference speakers. Also worth noting, how much bass are you seriously expecting out of 3&#34; domes? Really?<br /><br />Anyways, these are a fantastic bang for the buck. Ever since getting these I check my mixes maybe twice. Once on these, and once on a mid-tier set of Sony headphones, and it's done. Assuming these don't crap out on me in like a year, my five star rating will remain.
