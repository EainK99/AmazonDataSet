I've sat in many recording studios and mixed/mastered on a variety of speakers and using a variety of headphones for reference.  I'm not a \\"professional\\" but I've interned and later worked at a studio and had bands that recorded at different studios as well.  I've been able to get great results but sometimes lackluster results due to the variables envolved in any studio - equipment, room acoustics, placement, influences of others, etc.  With that background in mind, here's what I've found:  These headphones are revealing, and they are not \\"warm\\" or \\"full\\".  They have helped me to spot trouble areas in mixes that I've missed in the studio monitors, and to make the minute adjustments that bring balance to a mix.  They are clear without being overly \\"crisp\\", and the low end is detailed instead of trying to be \\"boomy\\" like so many consumer-grade units. In fact the entire range is detailed.  I've read of some folks wanting to break them in, but I've not had a need for that.  They were great right out of the box, and I hope they never change!
