You need a tuned uke? Well, you've come to the right place because this is the tuner you want. I've had my uke since my junior year of high school, two years ago for those of you who want to do the math and I haven't really been able to play it because well, 1: I don't have a musically ear and 2: I didn't know what tuner to get. I've read reviews after reviews and I arrived at this piece of heaven, the snark SN-6 Uke Tuner. It's great. It's small, compact, bright screened, and fits onto your uke like its supposed too. It's wonderful. You should buy this no lie, you won't regret it uke players you won't! :D
