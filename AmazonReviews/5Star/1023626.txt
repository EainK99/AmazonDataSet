More than I could have ever expected. I was just at guitar center and the les Paul this is a copy of is 3500.00 and this thing looks just as awesome I am so happy with it. Plays nice out of the box but I am taking it in for a full custom setup cause this guitar deserves to play as nice as it looks. I am happy happy happy.
