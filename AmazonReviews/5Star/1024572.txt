Ha ha I bought a bag of these as an add-on item not expecting much and they turned out to be better than all the other ones that I pay top dollar for. They are slightly smaller than the others and grip my thumb nicely. I've been using them for several months now and have yet to even break one. I'm sure I've lost and missed placed several of them, and I could care less they were cheap
