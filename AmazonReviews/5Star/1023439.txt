Absolutely Fabulous Instrument Tuner. I've tried many for my tenor ukuleles and most had some issue, whether size, not bright enough, not accurate etc. Seriously,THIS IS THE BOMB!!! Just received, put on one of my custom ukes and ran it through its paces. Did I say, Perfect? I was concerned by the advertising of super tight fit, I'd need a crow bar to open the hinge. It's amazingly comfortable. I write Very Few Reviews, but this deserves it. *Also the price on Amazon was 1/2 of what I was quoted by Guitar Center. *Trust me, Buy One Now for any stringed instrument i.e. Guitar, Ukulele etc. * I'm ordering a 2nd one right now. I'm actually going to clip on to one of my Hohner harmonicas in the key of C to see what happens. Paul in Los Angeles
