Samson Graphite has been an excellent MIDI controller keyboard, the feel of the semi-weight keys is fast, very responsive. The pads are great. Built solid, great if you have gigs and depend on taking the unit on tour. As a production tool, I work with Logic PRO x, Abelton, Cubase and I haven't had any problems with the configuration or assignment of the slider, knobs, parameter function.
