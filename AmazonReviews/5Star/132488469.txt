There is little to say regarding this guitar. WE all know Fender is awesome. So anything I say will just be a personal thing.<br /><br />One, get this guitar, forget Squier. Get this or the American Special. I prefer the feel and weight (if I am not mistaken), of the standards. Sure I wanted the headstock of the specials, but to me that Standard just looks classier and handsome and with better parts to my taste, I figured if I wanted a special I would get it custom made, since I cannot get the Olympic white color for the Specials, they made some in 2010, but are discontinued, so GET ONE if you know if someone is selling them because they are rare and will go up in value. I would do it if it had not been for the larger nut width, even larger than these and much larger than the standard non-american strats. I think a whole milimeter difference, but for some reason, you feel it, and I prefer thin necks, which was almost a deal breaker for for getting this guitar, since I preferred the Squier Deluxe feel, not look, of the neck even though the Fender neck is pricer and higher quality.<br /><br />Two, get the locking tuners in, though the original ones are good, the hell with it, we all know we need perfect tuning reliability, so no sense being cheap here, we love, we play it frequently, it is worth it. I rated this.<br /><br />Three, I like the warm sound of the pick ups, but needed the YJMs for the neck and bridge. I liked the Fat ones so much for clean tones, that I left the middle one in and this combination gave me a whole buffet of sounds for the hybrid positions.<br /><br />Four, the feel of the guitar is amazing, it is not very heavy, but just enough to make you feel like you have a piece of good quality wood attached to your body while playing, the whole thing resonates when played. The finish on the fret board side, is nice and slippery, much better than rosewood. The finish on the back, well, I wish it was a slippery as the Squier Deluxe,  though the Fender will age better. I love the finish on the headstock, perfect. The guitar is very handsome, and has wonderful color harmony. If you change picks ups, see if you can fit the original covers, because they go so well with the guitar. I think it is a work of art. Albino Fenders are my favorite.<br /><br />Now, about the bridge. I dislike that if I bend a note while playing another string, that tension will detune the string I am playing in the open, since the bridge is pulled, by virtue of the tension in the string. For instance, I cannot play guitar solos and rythm at the same time,if I bend, because that will pull the WHOLE bridge. Which brings me to the next question, is this why people 'block' the tremolo? I see that if you ground it, these thing will not happen, but can you still at least flatten the notes with the trem?  I really hope someone can help me with this 'blocking' the trem concept. Much appreciated.<br /><br />Guys, this guitar is awesome but the extra cash I felt it needed for the parts I mentioned, I think I was just under 1,500 dollars ( I live in Canada, taxes!!!). For this, I do not see the need in a deluxe, because if you can adjust things by replacing parts, well, then I wonder how much of an upgrade you are getting if the neck and can only get so good, and the bodies are more standard. I am not sure if I would have lost money doing what I did with a Deluxe.<br />Anyway, This is a great workhorse guitar. I love it, it is almost a work of art.
