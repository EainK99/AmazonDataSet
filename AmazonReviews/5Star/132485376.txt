I love the bass. Wide thin neck nice and light. Fit and finish are excellent.<br />The pickup is gutsy and articulate. The neck is a perfect size for my hands so they don't get tired when playing over an hour. I rehearsed with it last night and didn't feel tired afterward. The look is really cool like a black and white tux. I feel confident playing it.<br />Great bass and great price. Fenders marriage to Gretsch is a winner. Love the Cabronitas.<br /><br />8th Street Music is my new favorite vender. I had a problem with shipping and they were quick to respond. What more could you ask for?
