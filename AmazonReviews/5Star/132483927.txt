I really needed a sound system that is loud enough to play music over a small crowd outdoors in a very open field area for a performance in a park. This definitely worked. It is not something you would want for a large outdoor crowd, unless you just want to play background music. But, a large indoor crowd might  hear it better. This is definitely loud and in charge for small events.
