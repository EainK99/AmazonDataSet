I don't mind paying a bit more for a pick if it will do what I want it to do. These picks are the right stiffness and really do seem to get the most tone out of a string; I now use these (all three sizes, though mostly the A5 1mm version) exclusively for guitar and mandolin. I have heard that another brand is even better, but an amateur like me can't afford to spend $35 for a single pick, so I'll stick to these.
