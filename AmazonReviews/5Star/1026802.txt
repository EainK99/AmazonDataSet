I originally checked into having some cassettes turned into CDs or MP3s locally. Too expensive! One night while poking around for a tablet on amazon.com I came upon this piece of equipment and found it intriguing. I thought, how can something so inexpensive be effective. But I read review after review that were positive and decided to spent the $25 and give it a try. I am totally satisfied! It's easy to use and I'm SO happy that I'll be able to listen to my music on my Bose speaker AND be able to share it with nieces, nephews, and fellow classroom teachers.<br />One simply connects the device (with the provided cord) to one's computer and puts the CD into the computer. The simple manual gives instructions as to what to do next. It took me a couple of times of experimenting to read the wavelengths and assure myself that the songs were complete, but now I'm good to go. It's awesome to be able to label the tracks and have them show up in my itunes library just like any CD purchased.  Kudos to Digitope!
