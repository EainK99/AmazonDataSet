Arrived a day early. Awesome.<br />The American Standard Strat + An optional Gilmourish magic tone + the versatility of 3 different pups and an ON switch = Guitar perfection. Highly recommended. The guitar arrived fully setup, with excellent action and intonation. Required 1/2 tone tuning on all strings which is perfectly fine.<br /><br />A year later: I am still amazed at the quality. How it holds the tune, how smooth it is overall. A delight to play, a pleasure to look at. Needs the right amp to bring out the magic. I am world's away from Gilmour's playing quality but this one make me feel like I am just an ion closer...
