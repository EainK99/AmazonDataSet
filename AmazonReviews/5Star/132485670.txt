My 8 year old daughter is just thrilled with this guitar. She got it out of the box, put on the stickers, read the instructions and started playing the cords using the included cards all herself. Then she obsessed about getting it tuned right. I tried using the online tuner at the First Act website and thought I did ok but maybe I don't have that good of ear because she wasn't happy after I finished. Luckily my older daughter has an electronic tuner for her regular size guitar and that satisfied her. She then brought it in the car with us and practiced while we drove.<br /><br />The guitar is nice quality and seems well made and sturdy. The included chord cards help kids get a couple of cords to start strumming a little bit. What would be nice to have would be a few easy songs that use those cords. I will have to search for those myself.<br /><br />Overall this is a great value and it made my daughter very happy.
