well for my school, we use ipads for literally everything. Homework, textbooks, planner.... and this is very helpful because the keyboards doesnt need that much force to be typed and the color is nice. well i guess the only problem is that the design gets kind of boring since its just blend pink but i mean i knew that so i am perfectly satisfied with it. i think that if you use your ipad a lot and you need to type somethings for lots of things, i recommend this but if just for entertainment i recommend you to get a one that's lighter and have better design.
