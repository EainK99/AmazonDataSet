I have very small hands. This slide is slightly loose on me, but I wouldn't recommend this medium size for any man with average sized hands.<br /><br />However, this is a really great slide. The shape perfectly fits the curve of the strings and has a clear, warm tone. Being a brass slide, it's quite heavy. Make sure you have some really thick gauge strings when you use this.
