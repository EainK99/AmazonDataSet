I got these as a replacement for some Skullcandy Hesh headphones I got as a gift a while ago. Skullcandy doesn't have a great reputation, and I'm aware that I'm a plebeian when it comes to headphones. I'm used to the bass-heavy Skullcandy sound and I'm very impressed with these. The bass is just as good without being so overbearing. The headphones are soft and comfortable, and they muffle a fair amount of outside noise without music. I can wear them for more than an hour without discomfort even with my glasses on. They stay on my head pretty well too, and I wear them while running and unicycling. Since these are DJ headphones, the cord is absurdly long. This isn't an issue with a rubber band, though. These aren't as loud as the Hesh, but they come very close. They'd be suitable for use as a tiny stereo around your neck, if you're one of those people who likes to share their music with everyone in a public space. These are the best headphones I know of at this price.
