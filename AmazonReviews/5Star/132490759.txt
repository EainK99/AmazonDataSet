I played a AC30 a couple of weeks before I bought this amp, and it's because I was hooked on the clean VOX sound. I read a lot of reviews and did my research and it seemed like this amp would be the best for me. I'm living in a college apartment so I didn't want to go too big and annoy my neighbors. I also didn't have much of a budget for a guitar amp, so I decided to buy low. The package came in a couple of days later and I opened it up and was amazed at the size of this thing! The picture makes it look like an eraser but it's the size of a man's shoebox. The clean channel sounds unbelievably clean. I couldn't help but compare it to my old Ibanez IBZ-10 Tone Blaster Amp which sounded like there was a perpetual colony of bees hiving inside the speaker. The volume gets pretty loud even for its size and it still maintains that clean sound even at 12 gain and 12 volume. The &#34;overdrive&#34; setting is cool too. I haven't tinkered with that one too much, but it's fun to play &#34;Johnny B. Goode&#34; on.<br /><br />I didn't want to buy an amp that had all of the shiny bells and whistles that fall off after the first month. I wanted a quality amp for a low price, and I got it. You can always buy pedals to get all those cool sounds, and I plan on doing that too, but you need a good amp with a good clean channel like this one before you start getting into other effects. I would definitely recommend this amp to the college apartment dweller and to anyone else who wants an amazing practice amp.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this would be the best gigging amp though, but then again, I don't see myself gigging anytime soon.
