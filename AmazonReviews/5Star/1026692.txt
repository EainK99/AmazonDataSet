I love this gong. Affordable price for a true deep hum and beautiful crash. I write / record music and it has added a lovely atmosphere to quite a few pieces. For a real treat try bowing with a well rosined cello bow on the edge. It takes a bit of effort to get this much metal going, but once you do it is totally alien sounding !! Before I bough a &#34;real&#34; stand this was hanging on a wooden 2nd hand comforter stand.
