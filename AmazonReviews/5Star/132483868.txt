I've owned this speaker for more than two years now. And it delivered better than expected performance most of the time. JBL Sound Clarity is there at the highs, and the lows are pretty good considering the size and the weight of the speaker. if the weight is the most important aspect of your buying decision, i believe this is your best choice. Now I upgraded my system to PRX 612 which weighs 36lbs each. That's more than twice the weight of 510. Off course I have better sound and more headroom (which certainly i didn't need) but was this worth of carrying double the weight?I'm not sure really... This speaker is powerful enough to fill a medium size room 30x30 for example. It will entertain 30-50 people comfortably, but it wont make them jump out of their seats. It will do great job for a smaller cafe shop setting.<br />P.S. I dont believe there is any problem with ribbon or anything... Mine blew because of a single channel wireless mic that interfered with another mike and made these very loud noises... It blew the horn not at that instant but later on that day...<br />All in all this is a really versatile product that I recommend for the one man bands who work small venues an/or small conference rooms..
