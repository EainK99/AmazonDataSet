This is a very nice volume pedal. It's plastic but that's OK. It seems to be well constructed and I am using it in a home studio so it won't get banged around much. The two input, two output connections are nice and allow some flexibility. Pedal is silent and adds no noise to the signal path. The minimum volume control is a bonus feature. Nothing fancy here but overall a nice product for the price.
