This was a great buy. I had an awesome time unloading it and putting my violin in it. I want to carry it with me everywhere. Its amazin. It has back pack straps, and everything. You can store a 4/4 shoulder rest in the big pocket to the left, and in the front your rosin, and anything else. You can fit 2 bows and has a strap for the neck. it is extremely light And only 4 pounds.<br />I would suggest this to any violin player. It is one of the best buys I've ever made. Its A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.
