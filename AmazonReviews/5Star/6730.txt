I love my new Ukulele. I have never played one before and I am a beginner but it sounds great and is fun to play. The true color is a little greener than the picture, but I think it turned out prettier so that was a bonus. I have played it for two weeks and now the strings hold their tuning really well. The did not at the beginning but I looked it up and thats normal. The shark bridge is awesome too.
