This is a fantastic buy. My machine arrived well packaged & a day early. I am making beautiful Snow during the month of August in the South. The flakes look completely real & float across my yard like it is January in the Rocky Mountains. My neighbors almost wrecked their car on my street while rubber-necking at my snow storm in August. Needless to say, I am thrilled with my purchase!
