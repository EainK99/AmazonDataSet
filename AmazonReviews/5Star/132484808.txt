This violin came in perfect condition, the item had been modified by hand with great attention to detail and care as violins must be individually adjusted. I am very impressed with the sound, quality and the package was more than I could have hoped for at a great price. It arrived quickly and ready to play. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in buying a well priced, quality violin!
