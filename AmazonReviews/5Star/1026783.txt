I've had one pair for 6 years and another for two. They are great for for monitoring while tracking vocals or acoustic instruments because I have never had issues with sound leakage getting picked up by my mics. The response is rather flat, which is what you want in a studio monitor - not a ton of over-hyped bass like those cruddy consumer grade Beats headphones.<br /><br />If you are going to be doing a lot of mixing via headphones you might want to spend more, but if you're just using them while recording then they will really meet your needs.
