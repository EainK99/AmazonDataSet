Got a pair from a friend who got it from Amazon. First put them on my Galaxy Note 2 and they sounded weak and tinny! Not good. Then I switched to my Acer tablet and they exploded! Well not literally, when these are properly powered they sound awesome!  I did a quick test vs my elder pair of Sony MDR-V6s. The Sony's are 'burned in' with over 300 hours of use. The HD-280 Pros sounded 95% of that! After proper burn in (25-70 hours. Seriously) they sound virtually the same!  As for fitting and comfort, I could not wear these for longer than a few hours. I have a big head and the cover the ears well, but dig in a bit.  My tiny roommate said they fit perfectly on her head with no pressure. So if you got a small head (or maybe a regular head, like I said I got a big dome!) these would be a good fit! Noise isolation is very good as well. That jerk that sits across from you in the office who sucks his teeth for 3 hours after lunch will be silenced!  Even good for mass transit.  Not good for riding a horse, moped, or anything that you need to hear what's around you.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good fit over ears<br />Isolates noise very well<br />Folds up small<br />Great sounding depending on what it's used on. *See Cons<br />Great for movies!<br />Gold bling plug!<br /><br />Cons<br />Needs something with volume. My Note 2 was not enough. Tablet was awesome.<br />Fat Heads might want to try a pair first!<br />Plastic ear piece covers sorta warm on skin<br />Cord coiled, annoying if cord goes in front of you if computer is on the right.<br />Look really big on any head<br /><br />A great product when driven with a proper source (Computer, Tablet, iProducts? Loud Android Phones?) Comfort is great! (for normal humans).<br />There may be other choices for the same dollar level, however this is an excellent pair of headphones. Two thumbs up!
