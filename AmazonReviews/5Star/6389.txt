Works great, needs some burn in time and adjustment to get the right size ear pieces for the potential of its sound to mature. Definitely needs burn in time, not great right out the box but the longer they're used, the better the sound gets. Comes with a nice carrying case. A great pair of iems/earphones for on the go. I still prefer using headphones / speakers at home (I have audio technica headphones) because of comfort, but it's not convenient carrying or wearing those around town, and that's when these come in handy while providing great quality sound. Good design so they won't fall out your ears because of the memory wire, although sometimes the ear piece itself might need some adjusting.
