I'm a complete beginner to the bodhrán.  A few months ago a bought an inexpensive one (see my review of &#34;Trophy Bodhran 14 in&#34;) and I've been enjoying it.  The tipper that came with it seemed short, and I couldn't play triplets because my hand got in the way.  I finally bought this tipper instead.  What a difference!  It sounds better and feels better, and within minutes I was playing triplets.  The shape also seems to help prevent slipping.<br /><br />Since I have almost no experience, I can't compare this tipper to other tippers you might buy.  But I can tell you that it's so much better than the one that came with the bodhrán!  If you get a bodhrán that comes with a tipper, and you're having a hard time with it, try this tipper instead.
