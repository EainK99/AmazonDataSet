I've used many different strings over the years and Ernie Ball is my favorite.  I drifted from them at one time when I went to using flat-wounds for a period, and sorta forgot how much I liked them until I went back to round-wounds and used various brands with little satisfaction. I get the Ernie Balls back on my guitar and the tone is good, they are bendable, and they don't seem to break as fast as a lot of other strings that are out there. I also use their Hybrid Slinky strings on my bass and absolutely love them.
