I bought this before moving to Japan to practice my craft and begin building a home studio.  I place it on my desk across from my refrigerator, with my AC running, next to my poorly insulated window next to a street with police station, fire station, hospital, and streetcar tracks, and the recordings STILL sound great!  It does not remove these sounds completely, but this is easily fixed by using the noise removal functions in Audacity and similar software;  the remaining tracks are professional sounding and echo-free.  If space and budget are an issue, I highly recommend you consider getting this product or Harlan`s pro version.
