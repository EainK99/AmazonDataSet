Got my first tenor Lanikai about 4 years ago, and it sounds as good as ever.  I bought this one for a student and, first day, everything perfect.  Tuned up well, stayed in tune, sweet, sweet sound.  Student was over the moon - probably still practicing!  Kudos to Lanikai and Instrument Pro, and UPS.  Got another one coming!  My one peeve - No instrument should come without a case  :(
