I heard some great things about the Hohner Special 20 so I ordered one. When it arrived I quickly began playing it and was a bit disappointed it sounded odd compared to my Susuki Harpmasters and took more breath than the super effecient Harpmaster. But to my surprise as I was recording last weekend I picked up the Hohner by accident and was just lovong the tone when I discovered it was the Special 20 not a Harpmaster so,,,,, nice tone and I will try another,,,,just saying
