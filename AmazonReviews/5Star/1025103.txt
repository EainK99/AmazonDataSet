It gets five stars for the price. This is not a definitive overdrive by any means but for &#60;$30 it's a solid pedal. I found the tone to be a little too trebley but by dialing the bass to 3 o'clock and the treble to 10 I got what I wanted. If you set the drive low, it gets a tube screamer-like crackle and if you set it high, it's as intense as a distortion, definitely more intense than most overdrives go. Again, this shouldn't be compared to distortions/overdrives in the $150+ range but if you're just starting out or you're on a budget this will do you just fine. It is a bit clunky though so be warned that it won't fit on a pedalboard as neatly as a Boss pedal would.
