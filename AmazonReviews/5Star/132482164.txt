5 stars because I doubt you can do better at this price point.<br /><br />Looks:  nice, neat, and I was impressed.  It is all laminate, i.e. plywood, but even the 300 dollar martin has laminate sides and back.  The Fender has a lam top also.  It was not worth spending another 200 bucks just for a solid wood top.  The top of he Fender almost looks like a picture of wood, but I think its a veneer.  The wood on the sides and back is beautiful.  The fretboard is simple, yet very handsome rose wood.  Lets not forget this is a travel guitar which may get knocked around.<br /><br />Sound:  This guitar is loud.  It won't have the deep timbre of a fullsize, but don't think you are not waking up the house if you start jamming at 2 am. More expensive minis might have a better sound,  but for what I this for I'll keep my money.<br /><br />Cons:  Nothing you would not expect from any out of the box acoustic.  I hated the strings it came with.  Easy fix. The action was slow: the strings were too high off the fretboard for my tastes.  Sanded the bridge down a little and now this is a guitar I love.  2 simple, typical common fixes,  and i am very pleased.<br /><br />Conclusion: GREAT VALUE.  Value being the key word, with very little compromise.  If you want a solid wood top and maybe a warmer sound you'll need to spend another 200 bucks, but i doubt you will find a better 3/4 size guitar for the price
