This mixer is epic and I like all the options and things it always me to do with the Traktor program. However I am a little bummed that the audio interface is inside the mixer, meaning when I play out at clubs I need to bring my mixer to use Traktor program. Unless they have the new Pioneer mixers and the correct CDJ's that I can plug right into. But even then if I wanted to use the time code option of traktor and spin vinyl I would still need to purchase a separate interface. I wish it would cost $299 for the A6 interface, I would have but a different mixer than bought Traktor Scratch pro 2 separate for $299. OVERALL the mixer is AMAZING and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world!
