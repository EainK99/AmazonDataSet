My 17 year old has watched me play guitar for a few years now. It has made him want to start learning. His favorite color is blue, so of course this stood out to him. And of course he needed a left handed guitar. He tried playing my right handed guitar, but it was awkward for him. It really does sound good. He tuned the guitar and only had to retune it maybe 5 times and now he his strings are set. I've seen some cheaper guitars that had to be retuned every time you tried to play it. This guitar has a fabulous look to it and it sounds good.
