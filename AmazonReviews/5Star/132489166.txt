This is a great sounding and quality guitar. It is the Samick d5 guitar you can goggle it. Exact guitar. It is a steal for the money, been playing for 45 years, I have a Gibson , and a few other high end guitars, this sounds as good. Grab one if you can there getting very scares. Oh ps its not made in China imagine that.
