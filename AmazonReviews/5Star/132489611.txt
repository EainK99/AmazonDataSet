I had purchased this pedal for two of my piano students (sisters) who had a Casio keyboard, but no pedal. I was unable to find one that worked for them at our local music stores, so read that this one was compatible and ordered it. They were very happy that it worked and they can now hear the expressive results while they're practicing!
