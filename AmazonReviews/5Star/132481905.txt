Microphones are a subjective item, meaning that what satisfies one user may be lacking to another. Not so much because of the product's quality, but because of its match to a particular vocalist, software package or even a type of computer. This mike is solidly built from metal construction. It feels heavy and feels like it is built quite well.<br /><br />I have tried this mike with various combinations of computers and software, and it creates top quality recordings every time. Wavepad software on an iMac seems to work best. Using Wavepad on my PC yields the same high quality recording, but I have to amplify the volume more than on the iMac. On either computer platform, the mike gives my voice a smooth, natural, soothing sound for my recorded narrations and books-on-tape. It also does a decent job completely blocking out background noises like air conditioning ducts or average traffic noise outside. Consequently by design, you must speak close to this mike. It isn't designed for distance recording. It also needs a pop filter for best results, although if you're careful, you can achieve satisfactory results without a filter.<br /><br />The mike has very little preamp noise (low level hiss when there is no audio coming in), fully more than 60 dB below average voice level. Translation: your recordings will sound clean.<br /><br />With every product made there is a point of diminishing return, meaning in order to achieve another 10 percent in quality, you have to spend much more than double the cost. This mike rides the cusp of diminishing return. It is much better than mikes made for podcasting. You can make professional network recordings with this mike if you have the voice for it. For most users needs, it will be a top choice until you get to the six hundred dollar and over price range.
