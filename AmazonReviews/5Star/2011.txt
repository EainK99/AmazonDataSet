Great mic for doing audio or video interviews with your phone. I tested it using an iPhone 6. Audio was clear and clean for both people speaking without the annoying hiss and back ground noise that comes from the in phone mic. While I feel the distance between the mics is fine for interview work, the cable to the phone could use some extra length. I would highly suggest an extender cable to get the mic signal to a phone on a tripod.<br /><br />Love it and expect this twin much to become a much used item for me. Sound is as clear and as easy to use as the single mic Rodes I spent a lot more to purchase.
