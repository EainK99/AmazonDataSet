The Cordoba 15SM Soprano Ukulele is a well-made, solid instrument.  It stays in tune up the neck and it was playable right out of the box with just a quick tuning.  It has a pleasant, full tone with excellent sustain -- it really sings!  The Aquila Nylgut strings are fantastic.  I am not a professional, but I do know quality stringed instruments, and this little uke is wonderful.  I recommend it for anyone looking for a super soprano uke at a super agreeable price.  In fact, I liked it so much that I just purchased Cordoba's baritone ukulele and that, too, is a nice instrument at an affordable price.  Kudos to Cordoba!
