I'm currently a music major and a collector of obscure instruments and this just a fine addition to it. See, the melodica is a free reed, wind instrument. Google it. It sounds like a mixture of a harmonica and an accordion. Anyway, this model, as you can see, is a student instrument and relatively cheap. So don't expect it to be perfect in pitch. For example, when I bought this one for myself, everything was roughly in tune (Thank god) except 2 keys. Easy fix though, just look up how to tune it online or have the fine folks at a music shop that deal with reed instruments to take a look. Overall, this has become one of my favorite instruments and I've already used it in a few recordings. It's a bit sharp, but I like how it accents it. It's easy to learn, plays just like a piano. Be sure to breathe harder on the higher notes since the reeds are farther away from the mouth.<br />Beyond that, it's up to you.
