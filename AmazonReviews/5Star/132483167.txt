It was 2011 and I owned a stable of basses, passive and active, including a Warwick Corvette Std 5 and an EB MM Stingray 5. Why did I think I needed another one? Truthfully, it started with a twinkle in my eye because I’d never seen a stock fiver as stunning as this one and the price was right! Then I read a very favorable review in Bass Player Magazine. So I bought it.<br /><br />It’s been 2.5 years, high time that I tell you how this bass has exceeded my expectations, from delivery day through today. The time's ripe to explain why I’ve become so attached to my Luna Paz 5 that it’s up there with Spinal Tap’s Nigel Tufnel's &#34;Don't touch it--don't even look at it&#34; guitar. My pricier basses take lots of beatings and it doesn't bother me; battle scars add mojo. I don’t need to purchase “Road Worn” fakes. Yet with this Luna, each ding hurts a bit, so I’m getting another. Nobody will be allowed to touch or even look at that one.<br /><br />What do I know about basses? Self-taught thanks to 1000s of woodshedding hours, I’ve been playing the electric bass since high-school. During the past couple of decades, I’ve been playing professionally. I’ve performed and recorded with original bands along the VA-DC-MD/NJ-NYC I-95 corridor, and then expanded to include the Heartland. My musical experience is eclectic: Two bands had a strong electric blues- and folk -rock sound, and another was big on jangle- funk -rock. For a year, I recorded experimental music on-campus with a Princeton University musical composition professor. In every band and setting, I have always had lots of space and I used it: I'm not a &#34;he just stands there and plays roots and 5ths&#34; dude. Now I’m looking for another band (or professor), but that’s another story.<br /><br />Ordered via Amazon, the bass arrived double-boxed. It was padded and braced so well that it couldn’t have shifted en-route even if kicked around by someone mean. The shipper clearly didn’t want a sloppy delivery to ruin my bass. Out-of-the-box, the setup was perfect; I didn’t have to adjust string height or correct intonation; the strings were bright; there was no need to replace them. Also, everything was fitted flush, from the tiniest screw to the neck and body. There was not a gap or jagged edge to be found. Eagerly, I sought out flaws, because I’m like that. But there were none. All of this is rare at any price-point. And, yes, it came with Allen wrenches plus a pretty brochure tucked above the nut.<br /><br />Modeled liberally after the Precision Bass (PB), this, too, is a full-scale (34”) bass, the only scale I play. In many fivers, any scale below a finger-tugging 35” results in ugly side-effects, most notorious of which is the floppy, dull open B. Not here. Properly tuned, every string’s appropriately tight and an open B sounds as clear as an open G. PBs are rather heavy and bulky, kind of like my Stingray. Not the Luna Paz 5. Its body’s smaller, about 1” narrower at the upper and lower bouts. The nut’s as wide as a PB’s, but the neck’s thinner: Its flattened-U contour results in a radius about ½” less than the PB’s. It weighs at least 1lb less.<br /><br />The satin-finished neck sports flawless grain. It’s carved out of one piece of maple, including the headstock. I didn’t expect this great feature: Even costlier basses often have glued on headstocks. The fingerboard’s made of nicely-buffed rosewood with subtle shades of dark brown and rich matching grain. The 20 well-filed frets are finger friendly—no need to press hard—they don’t buzz. The fretmarkers are gorgeous moon-phase mother-of-pearl inlays. These are perfectly fitted to the fretboard’s level without a snag. The body is made of solid mahogany & painted gloss black, as is the headstock. The paint-job’s flawless. The gloss-finished cedar pickguard is a sight to behold: It’s etched with a Henna paisley pattern. I never play with a pick, so pickguards usually annoy me, since they cover so much of the body’s finish. This one augments the finish with its elaborate design and contrasting hues. It belongs there.<br /><br />The hardware’s coated with shiny, unmarred chrome. The tuners are classic PB-style open-gear; they turn with authority and don’t slip or hitch. They stay where you turn them, so you don’t have to worry about tuning during sets once you break in the strings. The volume and tone pots turn smoothly without any wobble. The output jack is at the bottom of the lower bout. I prefer that, since it keeps the cord out of the way and under the strap. I find this design superior to the PB’s lower pickguard jack placement. The top-loading bridge sports the “classic” PB design yet it’s much higher mass, similar to the new USA PB’s High Mass Vintage bridge. The strap pegs are quite good, but, since I love this bass, I swapped them with Dunlop strap-locks.<br /><br />As you’d expect, the PUP’s split coil PB-style. Unlike what you might expect, it’s actually designed for a five-string bass, such that the upper half, which covers the BEA strings, is longer than the lower, DG-string dedicated half. That’s never a given. Some lesser companies use a split coil PUP suited for a six-string bass, “hiding” this horror with plastic covering the “extra,” overlapping poles. The Paz 5 poles are aligned & polished. This is a powerful passive PUP. As a result of all this, you get a well-articulated and even volume no matter what string you’re plucking. The pots do a great job with gradually (vs. “suddenly”) attenuating volume and tone.<br /><br />The Luna Paz 5 bass has superb ergonomics. It balances perfectly on my strap: There’s no neck-dive, body-plunge, or other ailments. There’s no bulky neck-plate: Rather, the neck’s bolted flush to the body. This, along with a 90 degree indentation of the body at the heel, helps access higher frets. As with the PB, the “tummy” & forearm body-cuts add comfort and control.<br /><br />But how does it sound plugged in to a good rig? It punches through the mix like a Fender PB, thanks to midrange emphasis, but brighter. This gives you more tonal options, since you can always manipulate the tone on-board and on-rig. The strings resonate evenly. The earlier-noted lack of fret-buzz allows me to glide along with no clattering. There are no dead spots in this neck, either. That does wonders when playing amplified. In general, this bass is uniquely voiced for melodic runs along with grooving lines. It sings.<br /><br />Played live, this bass gets me lots of props from other musicians. They invariably tell me that it sounds powerful, yet more nuanced than a PB. I get teased along the lines of, “Doggit, it's pretty. Aren't you afraid you'll ding it up bad?&#34; Actually, yes, I am…as I noted earlier. So I tell them that “I am afraid” and have decided to purchase another one just like it so I can sleep well at night. “Laypersons,” i.e., the people who really matter at any gig, often come up to me and said stuff like, &#34;Wow--that's a gorgeous bass, man...check out the Henna & the moon inlays!&#34; And, even, “That's a custom-made bass, isn't it?” I don’t lie, but I smile.<br /><br />My 2.5 year-old Luna Paz has aged remarkably well. It sounds as good as it ever did, even better, as the wood matures. The finish hasn’t thinned out anywhere, the chrome’s as bright as when I met it, and you can barely see any scratches on the frets and fretboard, even though I play aggressive fingerstyles and use nickel-coated roundwounds. This bass was born with mojo.rds usually annoy me, since they cover so much of the body’s finish. This one augments the finish with its elaborate design and contrasting hues.
