For all the more you're paying, these strings are actually pretty nice. I mean, sure, they stretch like crazy when you first put them on (especially treble strings), but what nylons don't for the first few days? Maybe it's because I've heard other, far more expensive strings that sounded like crap even on nice guitars, but I think these are great for someone who doesn't pick very hard and likes a rather light tension.
