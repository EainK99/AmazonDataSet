This surge protector is great.  The enclosure is made of metal, the power cable is heavy duty, and the plugs are nice and snug.  A great value for the price, although I can't comment on its power conditioning attributes since I have no way to test for that.  Based on the build quality and the company reputation, power conditioning is probably okay... but Furman makes much more expensive power conditioners that I assume are much better.  This unit is great if you're on a budget and don't have high-end power conditioning needs.<br /><br />If you're EMF-sensitive, I am happy to report that this unit has very low AC magnetic field emission as measured using a TriField Meter.  Many surge protectors put off a lot of EMF because the wires carrying the current are often not coupled together so the fields don't cancel out (as they usually do in a standard power cable, in which wires carrying opposite current are close together so that the opposite fields cancel each other fairly well).  Furman did a great job with this unit because it doesn't put off any more EMF than my wall outlets.
