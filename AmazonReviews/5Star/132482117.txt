This is the greatest little tuner you can invest in! I have had other tuners which required everything to be silent while you tuned-this one does NOT! You can tune while others tune their instruments. It is accurate, easy, portable! One of the best musical investments I have made, outside of the guitar itself. The price was great. I had bought one locally for over $20. This one sold for less than $10! Very happy!
