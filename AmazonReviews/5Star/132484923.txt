Had problem with MY amp at first, but once plugged in, this is really a great guitar. The number of sounds with the 5 way switch and HDR proprietary GODIN feature (which realy doubles the switching to 10 combinations)is awesome.<br />I've got to admit that Amazon had a really LOW price on for a day and I just happened to hit it right. In any event, this is a great guitar.
