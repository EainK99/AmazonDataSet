When me,s hand tires and it needs a new motion,I down size with this and there is still enuf Paddy Wack to get around.Svelte! If your use to a drum set this stick will prove a challenge,no legs or other arm to help keep rhythm.For me a array of tippers keeps the whole big picture happening.O' a neat fiddler will be sensitive to different mallets and sticks.Worth a try if you play Bodhran.Dimmunitive variety it is.
