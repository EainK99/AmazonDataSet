I'm really impressed with this little light. Given the price, I went into it with very low expectations, but figured I'd pick one up for comparison with several other fixtures I was testing. When it arrived and I tried it out, I was really impressed! This is a totally viable uplight for many occasions, and great for accenting details around our building.<br /><br />This isn't quite as bright as the Par 56's, but I find it is a far more cost effective alternative for accent uplighting, and prefer the more expensive Tri and Quad LED's for when I need a more powerful wash anyway.<br /><br />It would have been nice if this had a master dimming channel for use in more complex DMX productions, but for standalone usage as an accent wash, you won't find a better priced option out there!
