Very sturdy, nice, durable, easy to assemble.  I could have bought and used smaller one, so be sure to measure your keyboard and space a few times.  Don't forget considering how the chair slides up to it and how close to the wall you want your Keyboard snd stand.  But if this is the size for you, I very highly recomend it.
