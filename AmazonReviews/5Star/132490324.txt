I agree with DOUGQ's review, the case is a perfect fit for the EG444C-VV.  That guitar fits well in that case. It's a snug fit but not a tight fit, in my opinion.  Pros: The quality is above average,  Very nice especially considering how much it costs. The brown color is a pleasant change.  Its very classic and vintage looking. Soft velvet lining with extra padding surrounding the sides of the body, back and the area above the strings. Seems to the purposes of keeping cost down and minimizing the case size. I'm sure we've all seen some outrageously thick cases before. Other extras are the storage compartment, locking clasps and Takamine logo.  Cons: It's not a fight case that would be built better, stand up to more abuse, and only cost minimally 3 times as much?  Its a fine case that I would definitely recommend it to a friend.  Cheers.  Update (5/15/2015):       It has been about a year and a half from my initial purchase of this guitar case for my Takamine EG-444-VV. I've used the case mainly for storage and the occasional move. The winters get dry where I live so I needed to keep it in a tight case, of which this case has served wonderfully. I use this case with a D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Humidifier which is another fantastic product.  The hinges, clasps and handle are still in excellent working order. The padding is still in place and still spongy.  The case has evidence of protecting my guitar in the form of a 6 in scratch across the surface where the front of the body would be.      I'm not one to pay more for something because it has a brand name written on it, usually it means the manufacturers jacked up the price and have given you lesser quality. It this case it was quite the opposite.  It's reasonably priced and excellent quality.   If you're guitar fits, buy this case...you won't be disappointed.
