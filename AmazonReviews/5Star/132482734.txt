I have been using Dragon Dictation software for work for over 8 years. This is the best of many mics I have tried. The ability to clip it to the laptop is much handier than handheld or over the head options. This $40 mic outperformed the $500 wireless Speechmike Pro [[ASIN:B004Z8VK3E Philips LFH3000 SpeechMike Air Wireless Dictation Microphone with Push Button Design]] and I don't need wireless as this mic stays on the laptop that I take from patient room to patient room and I never have to hold it. If only I could return the Speechmike....
