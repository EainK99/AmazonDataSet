Seriously one of the most comfortable thrones I've ever had.  I've used Roc N Soc and Pork Pie (both the round and the tractor seat) and this throne tops them in terms of comfort.  It's a good bit bigger than other tractor seat style thrones.  Took me awhile to decide to pony up the money for the throne and optional backrest but I'm very glad I did.  Because of the air lift, it does have some bounce to it, but I'm completely ok with that.  Pretty substantial weight-wise.  Overall, would highly recommend.
