Haven't gotten to use the one's that have been delivered yet, but I owned a pair before. I used to use these while drumming and jamming with my friends. I would be the only one that wasn't deaf at the end of a jam session.<br /><br />I also go to a lot of EDM shows where part of the experience is having the volume cranked up to absurd levels. These ear plugs turn down the volume without muffling and garbling the sound into a mess. Foam ear plugs ruin the music to the point where I usually end up choosing to risk my hearing rather than wear foam ear plugs. But these let a range of frequencies pass through and it really sounds like you just turned the volume down.<br /><br />Protect your hearing without losing the quality of the sounds.
