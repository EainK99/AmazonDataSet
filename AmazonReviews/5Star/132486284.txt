IMPORTANT!!  THIS BASS IS 30\\" FROM BRIDGE TO NUT. This was an important bit of info that I could NOT find reading about it. I scanned the reviews, and I thought I saw \\"short scale\\" somewhere, but this info needs to be in the description! As luck would have it, short scale is what I wanted. I've got a 35\\" scale 5 string and I cannot play it, it's too long. This one is great! Happy, happy, happy.<br /><br />Bass lessons this year for my 11 year-old, and I was wanting something inexpensive. This thing popped up, and being acoustic, it's something that can be used without running up my electric bill.<br /><br />I'm glad I took the chance!<br /><br />I just unboxed it a few minutes ago, and it only needed tuning. The action is actually pretty darn good as is. I might fiddle with it a bit, but I didn't receive a truss rod adjustment tool. May not need it. The neck is straight! Unexpectedly good. The strings are probably going to be replaced, but for learnin' they're fine.<br /><br />Finish: Pretty good! Mine has tiny, minute scratches, so little I don't care. Other than that, there is a tiny blemish on the sound hole. I'm pleased, esp. for the low low dollars. I haven't done a detailed examination of the neck, but I didn't see anything obviously bad, finish-wise. Only one strap button, as mentioned by numerous other reviewers.<br /><br />Sound: pretty good acoustically. I've not played acoustic basses very much at all, so I don't have a lot to compare to. I would say the E and A strings are just a hair quieter than the D and G, but that goes with the bass territory. Those frequencies are harder to discern than the higher frequencies. I wouldn't say it's loud by any stretch, but it is nowhere near as dead or quiet as I expected it to be! Thumbs up on that. Also, being a short scale, I expect the lower notes to get a bit rubbery or dead-ish relatively. Just gotta thump 'em a bit more, I suppose.<br /><br />So we get it plugged in... just wow! I'm truly shocked at the sound.I started with everything flat, experimented with each EQ slider (amp EQ flat). I settled for just a bit of low boost, mid cut, and high boost with the volume about half-way or just a bit more, this thing sounds GREAT! I can't wait to try some better strings on it. The low end is big and fat.<br /><br />Overall, it is NOT an expensive bass, and I didn't expect it to be. But for under $100, this is a steal. If I'd bought a \\"name brand\\" for $250 or more, I'd be giving this perhaps less stars, but this is an unbelievable value. If it gets busted, I'm buying another one. In a heartbeat.
