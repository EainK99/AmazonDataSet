This is a really good multi effect bass pedal for the money. The stomp buttons are sturdy enough and the effects are reasonable in quality. So far, I haven't had any issues with it. You might not want to take it on stage, but it's a very inexpensive way to sample some different effects and figure out how to use them in your music.<br /><br />I use this with several basses. But mostly with my Fender Squier 5-string. The funk and fuzz effects really compliment the vintage sound of any Fender bass, in my opinion.
