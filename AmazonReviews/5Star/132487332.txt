A friend of mine purchased a huge 42 foot toy hauler that has a beautiful set of spot lights mounted on each side of the front along with a foot long bar of led's accross the top. All these lights were controlled by one out side switch mounted on the lower front of his fifth wheel trailer.<br /><br />He made the mistake of telling me how he wished these lights were controled by a pocket remote control so he could turn them on as he drove up to the trailer and turn them off after he went inside.<br /><br />So un be knowns to him I went on line and found that Amazone not only had one 12 vlt. remote, but a whole collection of them. I picked the RMO1 1 channel unit with key bob remotes and hooked it up for him.<br /><br />Neither of us could believe it when it was still turning the lights off and on at 100+ feet.<br />It only has a 10 inch pig tail for an antenna and it is surrounded by metal on 3 sides but works like a charm.  He was amazed that I could find somthing like this so fast and get it here in just 4 days.  I told him to just think Amazon and magic happens :)<br /><br />Now that I see how inexpensive these remotes are and how easy they are to hook up I'm going to put remote shut off's on my RV generators.
