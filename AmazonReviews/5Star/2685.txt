What a beautiful guitar to look at and incredible sound. I recently bought this as my 11th guitar in the collection and it is absolutely one of my favorites. It has a great lightweight feel to it and amazing action playing it. I would highly recommend getting the 2014 SG special because the 2015 version no longer has the humbuckers which really alters the classic SG tone.
