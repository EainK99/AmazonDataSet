Item was as expected.  Not the greatest bag, but definitely not the worst!  Much better value than a similarly priced item at Guitar Center.  And this also came with a strap (for the guitar) & an assortment of picks.  Bag has straps to be worn as a back pack, but I kind of wished it also had a strap for the bag itself to sling over one shoulder.  Item was a gift for a budding guitarist, and the back pack straps allow him to carry this while riding his bike to practice.
