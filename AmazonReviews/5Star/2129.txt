Brilliant. Total silence in the effect chain. I had a Dunlop Brick previously which was ok but was still noisy. One downside is that wah pedals don't like being near it when they're switched on. They produce a loud hum when they're engaged so make sure you put the unit as far as possible away from the wah. They're totally silent when not engaged.
