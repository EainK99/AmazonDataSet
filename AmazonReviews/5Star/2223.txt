just received this amp today Aug 31, 2015.<br />Using this amp primarily for electronic Pyle Pro PED02 drums.<br />Very loud, plenty of punch power for small to medium size crowds, maybe even larger crowds.<br /><br />Amp has plenty of preset sounds to choose.<br />I'm really a big fan of the TurboSound brand quality.<br />Good solid thump and great low and mid tone.<br />The tweeter does produce that high end thrash from drum cymbals.<br />Both speakers throw out a very realistic sound.<br />I've also used this amp for my guitars too and the rocks out like a pro.<br /><br />The sub woofer output jack is very good to have and my Pyle Pro drums have a few preset sound modes that produce very low end sub woofer sound. So hooking a powered sub woofer to this amp really let the system blast clearly with powerful muscle.<br />The quality is instantly noticeable just looking at it. The functions and sounds prove it.<br /> I would give this amp a 10 star rating if I could and I highly recommend this for the frugal consumer. The cost seems high but really not if<br /> comparing the quality and the expected years of use from it.<br /><br />pro's - just a good powerful amp with great sound.<br /><br />cons - I don't really care for the preset sound button and having to scroll through so many to get the desired effect.<br />example: wanting to quickly switch between modes takes time.<br />  alternative is to choose the sounds I prefer and use each sound on each of the out pout channels, then just turn on or up the channel<br />  output that I want for the moment and play. Since there's only four output channels, my choices are limited.<br />  But I'm okay with it since the Amp is such a nice quality build.
