I ordered a few of these for accent lighting at a restaurant and bar that my family owns. We have the attached to the back of our new metal signs and turn the lights on at night time and they give a perfect glow when the light reflects off the wall. We can control the color and ape very other aspect of the lights. Simple to attach with the strong sticky tape that's included on the wire.
