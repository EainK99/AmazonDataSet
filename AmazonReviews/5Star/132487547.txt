Don't believe the myth that says that this is not suitable for use as a home stereo amp, or that it's really just for live music, p.a. systems, DJs, etc. HOGWASH!  It works great for home audio, and yes, it sounds extremely good.  HOWEVER...You will likely need to use some type of preamp. It will not provide decent sound without a good strong input signal. If you already have a stereo receiver, you can probably just connect this to the headphone jack on the receiver (that's what I'm doing).  Another audio equipment myth that never seems to die, is that if you \\"push\\" too many watts to your speakers, you will \\"blow\\" them. Speakers draw (\\"pull\\", if you will) current, so an amp does not \\"push\\", \\"pump\\", or \\"force\\" wattage to the speakers. Speakers cannot be damaged simply by connecting them to \\"too big\\" of an amp (although other things CAN damage them).  Make sure the impedance (ohms) is matched between the amp and speakers and that polarity is correct (+ to + / - to -). Don't push your speakers beyond their limits.  Once they begin to distort (\\"breakup\\", or whatever you want to call it), back off on the volume. If it's not loud enough at that point, then get bigger/better speakers. b.t.w. Don't fall for the ridiculously exaggerated specs. on some cheap brands of amps (four letters, starts with \\"P\\", as an example).  There is absolutely no way that you are getting 4000W for $149.
