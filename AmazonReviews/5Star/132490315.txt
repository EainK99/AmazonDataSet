We bought this as a gift for our granddaughter a year ago. She absolutely loves it. She was 4 at the time and while we tried patiently to teach her to strum it with the pick she would take it from us knowingly and show us that it is properly played with a set of drumsticks!! One of the strings finally broke last night and she is heartbroken. I am shopping for new strings today.
