Before I tried the HD9, I was using SD9 Drivers, which I loved. The only thing I didn't love about the SD9 Driver was their longevity. Seemed I needed a new pair every couple of weeks. The HD9 Drumsticks are a little heavier than the SD9, but they last a lot longer, at least in my case they have. These are my new favorite drumsticks.
