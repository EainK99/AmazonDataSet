I recently bought a 3/4 size Blueridge guitar that is described as a &#34;baby dreadnaught,&#34; which means it has a relatively wide body even though it is a small guitar.  Most gig bags I tried would not accommodate the shape of this guitar.  The gator case is a perfect fit.  It is a snug fit though, and when you first try to put your guitar in you may think the case is too small.  Just press down gently but firmly on the guitar top and it will slide in.  Over time I think it will loosen up.<br /><br />High quality case--the only disappointment is that it did not come with the white stitching shown in the picture, which is a handsome feature found on a Martin-style case.  Aside from that minor complaint, the case is rock solid.  Great deal.
