I bought this in the hope this would be an unobstrusive, yet durable stand for my Douglas violin bass in an apartment with only so much space. The compactness and ease of folding and unfolding the stand are impressive, but what I like best is the sturdy construction and the comfort I feel that this stand is going to keep my bass upright and safe from any tumbles or accidental knocking over.
