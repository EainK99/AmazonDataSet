Glad I did! This was my first set of open cans, and I really wanted to like them. I had decided I would get the premium version but realized the only difference is a carrying case and aluminum vents...not worth the extra $100. However, I was still worried that I'd regret getting the cheaper set....I don't. I LOVE THESE CANS! Having plastic vents makes them more durable in my opinion. Lets face it, run over these in your car...doesn't matter if they're aluminum or plastic...they're done. FOR NORMAL DAY TO DAY, I feel the aluminum would've made me very cautious in the way that I handled them. After all, who wants to spend good $$$ and have to baby anything? Since I'll be transporting these home for the weekends from my office, i wanted the set that I could not worry about...it was the pro's. I have the DT770 pro's, and they have remarkable sound, but the 990's are a step up. The 990's still have enough bass, but the treble is much more crisp. If you don't like treble, you might not like them. They're not harsh by any means, but they do have nice high's. Not for on the go...there is no sound isolation with these. And being open, they do leak very much. But alone in my office, at home after everyone has gone to sleep or in a studio...AMAZING!!! You will not regret this purchase.
