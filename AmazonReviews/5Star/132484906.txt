I already own the \\"on the ear\\" Grado SR60 and the wireless Sennheiser RS170.  Both are excellent.  These were my points of reference for comparing my new purchase.<br /><br />I was looking for an \\"over the ear\\" set to listen to short wave AS WELL AS portable MP3's and Pandora without disturbing those around me.<br /><br />Initially thinking that extremely faithful reproduction was not that important for my primary use, I looked at the less than $50 cans.  I learned this was a mistake.  Among the best rated among the less expensive units was the Monoprice, which is what I ordered.  After testing and comparing it with my other phones, I determined they were unacceptable.  They lacked \\"air\\" and sounded like there was excessive harmonic distortion, possibly from reverberation inside the fairly large cans.  Choral lyrics were distorted, not from cone breakup, but from internal resonance, I suspect.  Those were returned and I upped the ante and ordered this Sony.<br /><br />The Sony sound is dryer, not as much low-mid, but cleaner mids and highs.  These phones will rival the two really nice ones I already own, but with a different purpose.<br /><br />The form factor is also better:  lighter, less bulky, and more comfortable than the Monoprice, feeling very much like my Senns but with a wire.
