I was looking for a 1x12 cabinet to go with my Carvin VT16 head. Many I looked at were inexpensive but not built well. Ones that were built well cost more than I wanted to spend. I had seen several positive YouTube reviews and demos of Panama amplifiers and cabinets. So, I went for it. Solidly built. The attenuator is a great feature; lets me play with lots of tone but at a low volume so as to not disturb my neighbors. The Weber Vintage series 12 inch speaker sounds great. A good deal at this price and it sounds great.
