I'm not much of a bass player, so I bought this more for looks than sound. And in that department, this passes with flying colors. I've gotten countless compliments on how beautiful this bass is.<br /><br />As to sound, it's good for me, but again, I'm not picky. I've had some bass-playing associates tell me while it's not top-of-the-line, it doesn't sound bad at all.<br /><br />Finally, it's relativity light so it doesn't feel like there's an anvil chained around your neck.
