This little tool is a heavy, solid piece of equipment, I'm really surprised how little it costs. What a great and fun tool for guitar players. I loved cutting up my credit cards with this baby, just buy it! Ladies, if your man is a guitar player, he will love this as a gift, wish I had thought of this idea, good job guys!
