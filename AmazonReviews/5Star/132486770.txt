Yes, yes I do! I am not an avid musician who practices 3 hours a day, or every day for that matter, but I do love to play and I like that with Hal Leonard music books I can play well known songs, and feel great about myself, and all this because the music is easy to play. If you are a beginner and are tired of playing only music that is 10 bars long, these books are for you. I have also purchased the Hal Leonard Big Book of Christmas songs, and love it as well.
