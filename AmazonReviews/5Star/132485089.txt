These headphones are comfortable and provide great, clear studio sound. I have had these headphones for about 5 years now and I absolutely love them.  I use them for monitoring when I'm editing my voiceover projects. They are so comfortable that I can wear them for hours without getting a headache or ear pain that I've experienced with other headphones.  They completely surround my ears thus avoiding ear pressure which can be painful and a huge self-limiting factor when you're trying to edit long pieces of audio.<br /><br />(For reference: I also own a pair of the 202's but the earpads don't surround the ear, they just sort of rest on top which makes them incredibly painful after a relatively short time.)
