I have a Bugera V22 Head (I know, Uli Behringer's The Devil - whatever). I've had it for about 3 months. I've been playing for 15 years or so. This is my first &#34;all-tube&#34; amplifier. It sounded better than anything else I've had so far, but I believed with a new set of tubes it could sound better still. I did a little reading and put together a custom set to suit my needs - home studio & practice space (no playing out with this). Like everyone else who has purchased this tube, I was looking for earlier break-up. The stock tubes I replaced were Chinese Shuguang EL84s re-branded as Bugeras. Not bad. These are better. Very low-noise. Not only do I get less volume over-all (not as much volume drop as I was expecting, but measurable) and earlier break-up, but these sound darker. Darker in relation to what was in there. The stock tubes were a little bit shrill at full volume. These sound fuller, rounder, richer, and with more complex harmonic content. I know that sounds like the junk everybody says on forums to justify their most recent purchase. It's true though. These sound killer.
