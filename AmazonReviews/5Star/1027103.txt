We bought this to use to mike a flute with Smart Music.  It works so much better than using an iPad with the built-in mike.  You will have to buy a separate cord to link it to a PC (we found this out the hard way), but they are readily available through Amazon. My daughter records playing tests for her high school band class with this, with great success. It will also come in handy for recorded auditions for things like All State. For recordings like this, a good microphone is a must.  We are very pleased!
