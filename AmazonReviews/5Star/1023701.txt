Just got this today, so my review is based only on the initial tryout.  The shoulder rest fits the fiddle and my shoulder really well, better than the previous Wolf model I had.  The other nice feature is that it folds, and fits perfectly into the shoulder rest compartment of my fiddle case. It it holds up, it will be a keeper.
