This turntable is exactly what I wanted.  It burns a CD of the vinyl record without having to use the USB hookup to the computer.  Of course you can do that if you want to.  The only negative I can think of is that is there no way to filter out some of the extra noise on the old records.  That isn't real important me though.  This the turntable  for you if you are wanting to convert your vinyl to CD's without a lot of computer fuss.
