This is a very serious and well playing instrument and stands apart from my other collection of chromatics under $200 unit price. It compares favorably with Hohners and should be considered.<br />My particular instrument DOES have a few buzzing notes that tend to clear up after a good warmup. It may need a set of new windsavers. I haven't tried to change them.
