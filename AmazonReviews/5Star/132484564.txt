Some months have passed since the last review in which the customer was missing bridge pins. I'm happy to see they resolved this issue and my order included the pins as pictured. In fact, what I received was exactly what was written:<br />Material:bone,ebony<br />Nut size:43*6*8.5mm<br />Saddle size:72*3*9mm<br />Bone Pins abalone Dot skirt:5.33mm<br />Package Includes:<br />1* Acoustic Guitar Bridge rosewood<br />1*piece nut<br />1*piece saddle<br />1*piece end pin<br />6*pieces Pins<br />All high quality. The saddle will need very little sanding as it fits the slot pretty well to start. The bridge will need the string holes drilled through which is common.The bridge pins have a snazzy Abalone dot for a little axe bling. For short money I can breathe life into a garage sale banger Stella Harmony.
