Purchased this for my 5 year old so he could take actual lessons, since he's too small for guitar.  The fact that it comes in so many colors made it very fun for him to pick it out.  He was really excited!  We did put on new strings - upgraded to Aquila.  Very glad we did and well worth the small additional cost.  My husband easily re-strung it (and our son is a leftie so he just reversed the strings) and we tuned using a snark tuner.  The snark tuner basically does the tuning for you and extremely worth the investment.  Found it for $6 online.  The ukulele comes in a basic yet effective matching carry bag that my son can easily work himself.  He's owned it for about 2 months now and the strings are holding their tune very nicely.  A fantastic soprano uke!
