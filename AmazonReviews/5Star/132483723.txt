Very easy to use. Great sound quality with nice effects for vocal recordings. A lot of features for the price. The ability to burn an audio CD and/or transfer songs from a CD to the recorder is an extremely useful feature. I've had the unit for a few weeks, and I'm still experimenting with the features/functions. I'm using an external condenser microphone, although the built-in mics are not bad at all.
