I needed to replace my 15-year old 61-key keyboard with something more modern.  I compared the various offerings, and concluded that this was by far the best price performer!  And it included the power supply!  I think it was delivered within 48 hours.  It has added so much to the rehearsals of our group.  We ordered a second keyboard for our clubhouse.
