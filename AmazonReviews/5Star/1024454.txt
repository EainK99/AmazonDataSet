My wife just ordered this unit for me for an upcoming gig as it was time for an upgrade from my old dual cd decks and mixer to a more compact system. The EMB player/mixer ran like a charm out of the box and I am still dabbling with all the bells and whistles but I would say this product is a great system for entry level DJ's to the veteran gigsters alike as all the goodies on mine run just fine and mine did indeed come with a users manual laying out all the functions in detail. This is a fine addition to my hookup and I would recommend it as an affordable player for your next party.
