I ended up not needing this in my under cabinet lighting installation, but it works flawlessly. The lights I bought were fine as is, so I decided not to use this, but I only found that out by testing it.<br />The dial moves smoothly and the light brightness changes smoothly with this dimmer. If you want one that you will use often, consider the fact that this isn't the most aesthetically pleasing dimmer ever, but if it's just to reduce the lights and leave them that way, thee's no reason to go for anything else.
