This is my second G 7th Capo. This is about as good as you can build a capo. Its solid as a rock and Does NOT distort or effect tuning. Black is very cool, but don't expect dull or flat black, as it is shinny \\"Black Chrome\\".<br />Comes with a felt lined box to protect the finish. Its very pretty , but jury's out on how durable the black finish will be. None the less, every guitar player who I've shown it to has loved it!
