My friend is a guitar player and I heard him saying one night that he was wanting to try out a new tuner. I do not play the guitar so I asked him if he would give this one a try. He used it that night. He told me he loved the simple design with the easy clip on feature. Really liked the digital screen.  **This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided.
