This guitar is great. I love the low action on this guitar, how light it is, and very loud loud. Took it to my dad who is very judgmental about guitars. First look at it he was like that guitar is not the best. I told him to play it and he said, damn it's loud. He then said if he could take it to a gig to play with it; I told him no, LOL. Love it, you won't regret spending your $300 dollars for this guitar.
