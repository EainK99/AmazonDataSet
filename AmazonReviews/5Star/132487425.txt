Ever since I discovered these mouthpiece cushions I can't live without them, they provide excellent protection for both your mouthpiece and teeth, they absorb vibrations and prevent your teeth from slipping away from a bare mouthpiece.<br />The thickness is perfect also as it doesn't mess up your embouchure.<br />If you are like me and are very picky and sensitive about your embouchure, stick with cushions as slim as possible, as I personally found the thicker ones completely changed my embouchure.
