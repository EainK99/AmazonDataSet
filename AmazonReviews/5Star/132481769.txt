Like most home-recording enthusiasts, I researched extensively when it was time for me to upgrade from a small interface (M-Audio Fast Track; circa 2006) to a larger rack-mounted interface. You'll quickly discover that the really good interfaces use firewire or thunderbolt connections. For those user's without firewire equipped computers, the USB choices are slim. So what makes the US-2000 the absolute best USB choice?<br /><br />1. Led metering for EVERY channel: Many rack-sized units have led metering for two channels, or clip/signal-single/double led metering. This unit gives you a full 5-led meter per channel.<br />2. Jack placement: Many units feature most, if not all the inputs of the units in the front (see the Presonus AudioBox 1818VSL). This becomes a problem when using this unit in a rack or with other equipment: the xlr cables stick out, they're easy to trip on, and it generally just clogs up your work area. The US-2000 has all but two of it's inputs routed to the back of the unit.<br />3. 16 Analogue Inputs: With 16 mics you can easily record a full band live. Many units this size only pack about 8.<br />4. Price: The US-2000 is $100+ cheaper than any other unit in it's class.<br /><br />I bought this unit in early summer of 2012 and have used it 3-5 sessions a week for the last year and a half. The only difficulties I have had have been my own errors: installing the wrong driver/firmware, adjust the sample block size and latency incorrectly. As with any new piece of software or hardware, this one takes some time to truly master.<br /><br />Here is an ultra-simplistic drum demo I recorded through the US-2000. No fancy mic's or outboard gear; I went straight through the US-2000's preamps into the computer. I hope this is a good indicator of the units flexibility.
