I am very happy with these strings!  This is a replacement set for the same ones that were on my guitar.  I am still somewhat of a novice - I've only been playing a couple of years so I'm very much still learning.  IThese strings are good for someone learning and they have a great sound. I was happy that it was a 3 set package.  I live a distance from any store so it's nice not to have to drive quite a ways to get new strings when I need them.  Thank you Amazon!
