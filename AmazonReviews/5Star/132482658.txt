I'm a fan of many types of music and these headphones certainly demonstrate their capabilities better in certain genres than others. If all you listen to is pop rock and country, you can probably take a pass on these. The difference is fairly minimal in these genres and, while it sounds &#34;better&#34; it won't change your life. That said, while listening to hardcore, metal, and electronic genres I've stopped myself on multiple occasions and just said &#34;wow.&#34; The bass is so heavy, high notes sound so good... the sound quality of these headphones simply cannot be beaten at this price.
