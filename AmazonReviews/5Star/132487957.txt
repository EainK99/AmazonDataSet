I didn't realize how much of a difference this would make. It's incredible, the floor tom is so much more resonant now and sounds great. Another reviewer stated this but, if you like your floor toms to be muffled, this is most definitely not for you. Mine pretty much has the resonance capacity of a gong now (not really, but you get my point.)
