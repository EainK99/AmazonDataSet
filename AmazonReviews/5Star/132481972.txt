I have never so much as touched a violin in my entire life which is why I ordered this one. I am not an expert and only a beginner but after sitting with this product for some time and with the aid of some youtube \\"how to\\" videos I got this working just fine. I did not know what all the components were but slowly I learned what the resin was for and how to tighten the bow and install the bridge. It comes with a small how to guide for everything and extra strings. Be careful with this as I am sure you would be with any violin but because of its price I made sure to be extra careful. It held in there just fine. If the violin broke tomorrow I would still be satisfied with my purchase. It made for a great night of learning what the instrument was all about. I am looking forward to learning to play more with this violin. Good starter and much better than I thought it would be for the price. You get everything you need right here for a starter kit. I have yet to use the tuner since it requires batteries that I did not have. I had to push the pegs in a bit to keep it tuned but after putting a little force into it that held in fine. From never touching a violin to playing \\"twinkle twinkle little star\\" on a bored evening. Satisfied with the product.
