I use this in my job as an activity coordinator with Alzheimer's patients. It's great for sin-a-long when a piano is not available. I have even taught a few folks to play it themselves and this is very empowering! I also gave my mother one, which she plays every day just to entertain herself. This is very simple to use and provides tons of satisfaction from playing music. Great for all ages.
