I purchased these for mixing and mastering in my home studio. Similar to another reviewer here, I was initially shocked at the size of these. In hindsight, I could have bought one size down. However, I am really happy with the sound quality. There really is an incredible clarity to these monitors, and imaging was excellent. I didn't have any issues at all with hum that at least one other reviewer has indicated.
