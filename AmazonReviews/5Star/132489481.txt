I use this mic for live music. I've used it on snare, toms, kick drum, guitar cabinets and brass instruments. Works great everytime and has even been hit a few time by sloppy drummers. It doesn't quite have the stage noise rejection of a Shure SM57 but for $30, it is a great sounding mic. I bought more!
