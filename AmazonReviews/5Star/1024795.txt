Most like that the width of keys are standard.  I would've like if the black keys were raised a bit higher, their low profile was the main emphasis for portability.  Still giving it a very good score- thinking of getting a 2nd one.  I would really like if they had a 31key version (Low B- thru 2 oct, up to hi F); or a 37Key version (3 oct, but from Low G to hi G).  -not all of us default playing in the key of C everytime... still like the product.  Thanks.
