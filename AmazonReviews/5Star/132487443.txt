i have no complaints at all. The finish is even and deep. no flaws or scratches. it has the slightly wider neck with exceptionally close tolerance and no fret buz, at least not in my style of playing. the v and t pots have an \\"almost\\" immediate response and the pick-ups have plenty of \\"snap\\" if you need it.<br />  with that i'll say thank you amazon for a great deal and i think i'll like this guitar a while.
