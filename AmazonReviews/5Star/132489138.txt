I received this case last year, I wanted to see how it held up. The quality of this case is great. I was looking for something that would be sturdy enough to protect and hold the pieces in, but not bulky and ugly on the outside, as I'm a petite woman and lugging something bigger just becomes cumbersome. I like the fact that you can carry it various ways, it really comes in handy depending on where you're carrying it to or what else is in your hands. The only &#34;complaint&#34; I have is that the side pouch isn't exactly big enough to fit a full size music book or unfolded music sheets. But that hasn't been such a big deal for me. I would recommend this case.
