This is a great instrument! I've been playing trumpet for over 30 years, and figured I'd throw money away on a cheap horn. But the quality of this trumpet defies the price. Valve action is nice and smooth, the sound is nice and warm, and it looks great. This trumpet would be a bargain at twice the price! Do yourself (or your kid) a favor and BUY THIS TRUMPET. I promise you won't be disappointed.
