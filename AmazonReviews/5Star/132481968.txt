I bought one of these about 4-5 years ago and it has been very cool, originally this was for recording, but found the live application favorable as well (in a rock band no less). I must admit motivated by my disability (had both hips replaced) I have taken a minimalistic stance on equipment, but this has maximized my sonic landscape. I use a pedal for my sound and an amp for my... well, amplification. My foot pedal includes a tube pre-amp but honestly the lunchbox has real good tone on it's own.<br />Recently I have moved to bass from guitar and after three months could not resist playing my 5 string through it. I read the literature to make sure I would not fry my favorite lil amp, plugged her up and...it was ok. I had to keep the gain very low to eliminate break up, but then I hooked up to a cabinet, ran the bass through a Hartke Bass Attack pedal and boy howdy!<br />I initially get the sideways look from most musicians for my willingness to buck trends but the nod off approval at days end comes because this was a tone thing all along.<br />Nice, nice, nice! surprising volume cool tone and a stomp pedal's best friend. Switchable on/off built in speaker and way portable, whats not to love!?!?
