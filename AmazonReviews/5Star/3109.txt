It's perfect. I bought mine used to save a couple dollars and it was still in almost perfect condition. Great sound, easy to use, and a lot of resources on the internet for teaching yourself to play. I got it because I've always wanted to learn how to play an instrument and wanted to start with something kind of easy and this was perfect. I definitely recommend this ukulele
