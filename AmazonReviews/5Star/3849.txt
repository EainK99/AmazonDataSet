There's a world of difference between this beauty and the cheap piezo pickups so many people use with their uke. This pickup really brings out the warmth and tone of my uke. It attaches with a suction cup, it's easy to move from uke to uke as needed. It's so small, I can store it in my uke's case where it's always handy. Drop by the vendor's website to hear audio samples.
