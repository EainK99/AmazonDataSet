I bought this DAC to replace my soundcard & mic pre amp.<br />I cant believe everything is USB powered. as a result, gain is a little weak but sufficient.<br />both DAC and ADC sounds great and no latency issue on Windows 7, Adobe A3<br /><br />Con: powers off in sleep mode and doesnt turn back on with computer
