Seymour Duncan pups(probably the best pups you can find,in a perfect combination),an absolutely stunning finish,in a sea of guitars that all look alike,this one is one of a kind,a sound that is solely dbz's(i have another dbz and like gretsch,(-that great gretsch sound) dbz guitars have a tone and sound that thay can claim as &#34;that great dbz sound&#34;.) This will hang proudly with my gibson-custom,prs mccarty,gretsch aniversary,rickenbacker jet-glo,fender jaguar,d'angelico new yorker......I'M NOT BRAGGING,just trying to stress the exceptional quality and beaty of this honey that when she sings everyone listens,and once your eyes take her in you can't turn away!Not enough stars to properly rate this work of art! Big thanks to dbz for giving something new and fresh with all the playability that a player could hope for.....Love you guys at dbz...!NOW my other love....amazon..&#60;3..NO ONE,and I mean NO ONE even came REMOTELY CLOSE to the deal I got thru amazon..did I say no one!!! I saved HUNDREDS of dollars,enough to buy another guitar..haha....This is not the first time Amazon blew a guitar price out of the water,happens quite a bit.I always look for the best price I can find on line and then go to Amazon and many times I find myself saying&#34;How can they do that???&#34;.Equal thanks and love to the guys at Amazon.....
