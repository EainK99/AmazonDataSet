[[VIDEOID:ad137d538a962ffc96bd1b68f5749756]] Due to the invalid link in the manual and the QR Code save some time and just get the EZCast Android app here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actionsmicro.ezcast&hl=en<br /><br />Okay so I just gave a quick example of some playback and a few options this unit offers in the video. (Web surfing, Radio, Micro SD card music playback, Microphone which basically makes it like a PA system. Those were the features of many I decided to offer a quick example of in the video)<br />Thinking about it after...not signed in to YouTube...explains the YouTube content. ;-)<br /><br />It really took way longer than it should for what is really a very simple process but once it was done AND upgraded I did find it enjoyable and the app easy to use.<br /><br />It is as you could see very small, easily portable and very light in weight.<br /><br />So all in all I REALLY like the device, Amazon only offers 4 star Like and 5 star Love...I'm going to say this is a 4.5 REALLY like unit because it works great after the initial hurdle. I'll go ahead and round this one up to a 5 because of how well and easy it works when it is setup. Just be aware you might be working with it for awhile before the enjoyment portion begins. (If after it was working it gave me more grief I would certainly NOT say it merits 5 stars).<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.
