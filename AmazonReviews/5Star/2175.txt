I found these cans to be all around excellent.  Great build quality for $100, and the sound quality is top notch.  In this price range you can't beat them.<br /><br />I see some folks complaining about comfort, but I wear these almost everyday and they are fine for me.  Very comfortable.  Maybe it depends on the size of your head and ears, but I have no issue with the way these fit.<br /><br />Deep bass and rich sounds.  Get them now.  Oh and the long (detachable) cord is perfect for me too - love it!
