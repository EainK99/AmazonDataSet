I bought this item to use as a karaoke machine.  Here's my setup:  Chromecast on the tv, audio output from the tv to this mixer, audio out from the mixer to my A/V receiver.  Attach a microphone, connect your phone/tablet to chromcast and lookup karaoke or official music videos on youtube. This way you get to use your own speakers instead of the cheap speakers that normally come with karaoke machines.  Have fun! :-)
