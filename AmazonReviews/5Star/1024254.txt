I bought this head for a 1967 Ludwig Acrolite Snare. The warm sound of this head was just what I was looking for for this drum. Cosmetically, the coating supports the vintage feel of the drum. The head is sensitive enough to make good sound with brushes, but durable enough to wail on as well. As with all Evans Level 360 drum heads, tuning it to the perfect pitch was a breeze. I paired this head with an Evans 200 Snare Side and Pro Sound brass snare wires. The combination achieves a perfect warm tone, with a bright buzz and ample sustain.
