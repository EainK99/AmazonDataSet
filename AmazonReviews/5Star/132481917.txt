I purchased the \\"Dblbass buggie®\\" after buying another product for far more money that did not perform. A double bass is heavy and if you have to carry it a distance to the gig, it becomes even heavier.  I carry my 3/4 bass in a Tuff® bag. It is very thick so I wanted to make sure that I could wheel around my bass, in the bag. I called the manufactures and spoke to some great people. They assured me that I could.<br /><br />This dblbass buggie® is the greatest! And so easy to attach! My bass, inside a Tuff® bag rolls anywhere I want to go, easily. Rain or shine! Put it on in no time, and take it off in less. Do NOT attempt to stand or leave the double bass on the dblbass buggie® unattended.  \\"Do you really want to take a chance with such an expensive instrument?\\" I rest my case! This thing is simple and all my bass friends are dying for one.<br /><br />Most any size double basses can fit on the bass Buggie®. The Buggie is made of light weight high impact plastic and used 5\\" wheels with bearings. Straps and bungie cord are constructed of durable material. A Buggie Cushion can be purchased separately. See web site and/or Youtube® video for additional information. Can't go wrong! Worth the investing to protect your investment! And easy on your back!
