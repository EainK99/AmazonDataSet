My experience with these types of systems is twofold. Several times a year we have weekend events. We use a portable system outside to announce race times, then move it inside to announce awards. A while back I had a friend that did small gigs in bars and used a similar system. I also borrowed that system a few times.<br /><br />Granted, those systems are around 8 years old, but they last forever.<br /><br />Picture a big 1980's boom box and you have a handle on the looks. The front has the speakers, ports and power indicator, while all the connections and controls are in the rear. There are two combo inputs, each handles either XLR or 1/4&#34; jacks. There's no phantom power, so if you use a condenser microphone, you'll need a phantom power source. Plus there's a 1/8&#34; stereo input that shares a channel with the BlueTooth input (background tracks, music, etc.)  So four channels total (two mono, one stereo.) There's also a monitor out jack.<br /><br />Each channel has individual volume controls on the back of the box, plus there's controls for effects, EQ and feedback.  But to really bring this thing to life, you need the app (iDevice or Droid.) It takes D cell batteries, and an optional rechargeable battery pack is available - AC power supply is included.<br /><br />300 watts of power is plenty for most uses, plus it's light - 11lbs.  It will take some practice to get the hang of all the settings, but it's pretty straightforward - especially with the app. If you want to mount it on a pole or point it upwards, you'll need the optional kickstand/pole mount.<br /><br />Setup is quick - set it in place, plug in your connections, run the app, adjust your settings and go.  Setup is maybe five minutes, giving you plenty of time to get your presentation ready, tune, etc.<br /><br />The Freeplay is an extremely versatile, compact and lightweight system with plenty of connection options and great customization via the Freeplay app.
