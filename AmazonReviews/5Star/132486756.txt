Bought this case for my daughters Ovation and we traveled with it to DC recently for a concert she had.  It completely protects the guitar and could be worn like a back pack.  Can't do that with a typical hard shell case.  Its a great case if you want to travel or don't want a big heavy case.  Fit in the over head bin no problem.  Definitely recommend.
