I used this to replace the bridge on my 2013 squier vintage modified jazzmaster. Although it has a more curved fingerboard radius than the squier jazzmaster, I was able to raise the low and high E saddles by sticking a piece of rubber under them, and now it's fine.<br />The fact that there are no individual height adjustment screws is a huge plus; no more annoying rattling!<br />The neck on my guitar is shimmed, so the bridge is higher than normal, however the low E string is still prone to pop out of its saddle when fingerpicked, or if you try to do any crazy bends (I'm using .11 gauge strings btw). If your neck is not shimmed, or you use regular gauge strings you will probably still need a buzz stop to COMPLETELY stop any issues with strings coming out of grooves.
