This product was purchased because the top of my acoustic requires that no polish be used on it. This is an all-natural agent that cleans without filling the pores of the wood without any type of silicone or other wax. I also use it on my solid body guitars as a regular cleaner for fingerprints and dust - in between regular polishing. I highly recommend the product if you have a specialty acoustic with open pore finish - it will keep your fine instrument clean without harming the finish. Great product.
