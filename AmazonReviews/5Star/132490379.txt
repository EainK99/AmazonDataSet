Having a dual finish ride area on the profile is an innovation. The traditional finish area has a slightly darker sound than the area surrounding the bell.<br /><br />This cymbal has a lot of wash regardless of which area you are playing on, so if you are expecting or desiring a defined ping type ride this will not work. It is wonderful for jazz and some forms of blues, as well as some forms of alternative rock. The bell is a nice feature. It's considered to me medium by Zildjian, but has a respectable amount of area and will cut through most amplified music. I love the chime-like, musical quality it projects.<br /><br />On the topic of projection, this cymbal has a fairly wide dynamic range. You can play it softly at the P or PP level, all the way to FFF. However, do be aware that this cymbal's wash increases with the sound level. It also crashes nicely, but the sustain is seemingly forever, so you need to choke it shortly after crashing it. The crash area is from the edge to about four inches in for best effects. If you strike it in that zone it will open fairly fast with a nice attack.<br /><br />One final note: Zildjian seems to have a magic formula for 21\\" cymbals. Every one I have tried in that size range has been easy to control and exhibited serious mojo. This one is no exception. To be honest it did not fit perfectly with my playing style or music genres, but it's a winning design with an interesting range of sounds you can coax from it. Definitely give it a try in person to see if it's a fit for your own style and music.
