I own several wood Native American Flutes. This simple piece of plastic will serve two functions. 1) I can toss it in a bag and take it with me with little chance of damage. 2) Practice, practice, practice. My wood flutes tend to &#34;wet out&#34; after about 25 minutes of practice. It will be easy to dry this flute out and continue practice.<br /><br />Your first note: cover all holes. Blow very, very gently into the end close to the white plastic. You should get an even tone. This is called the root note.<br /><br />If you get no sound.  Be sure that the white plastic is adjusted to cover the hole close to you (yes there are two holes). The front edge of the plastic should be aligned with the rear of the front hole. 99.9% of the hole should be visible.<br /><br />Breath control is very important, experiment.<br /><br />Was this worth the cost for a simple piece of plastic? Without a doubt.
