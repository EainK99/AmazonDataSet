I bought this attachment to mount a microphone boom to the rear of this [[ASIN:B0002F6JH6 On Stage 2 Tier Folding Z Keyboard Stand]]. I was worried it might not fit since the tubing on the Z-stand is square. Also, an earlier reviewer had specifically stated that it didn't fit this particular stand.<br /><br />Well I am happy (and relieved) to report to you that it DOES fit the \\"On Stage 2 Tier Folding Z Keyboard Stand\\". In fact it fits it perfectly; snug and secure. You can buy with confidence.<br /><br />I did also purchase the [[ASIN:B0007SL86A On Stage QK2B Microphone Clip Quick Release]] at the same time. It just makes sense to be able to remove the boom arm with a quick touch of a button, rather than having to mess around with rotating the entire thing to unscrew it. The quick release clip also gives the attachment a little extra height, and that's a good thing for anyone who might have a keyboard with a bit more height to it than normal.<br /><br />I'm extremely pleased with my purchase, and would definitely buy this same product again.<br /><br />That's it! I hope you find this review helpful. Happy shopping!
