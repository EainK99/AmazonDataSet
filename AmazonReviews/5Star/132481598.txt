These headphones are my travel monitors for podcasting. While I didn't buy them from Amazon, the customer reviews helped push me to get them. I love how they're collapsible and have their own travel bag to keep dirt away from them. I've even tossed in an headphone splitter in the bag just to keep them both together when needed. I've worn them for hours upon hours of podcast recording at times, and they remain very comfortable, but do get warm. That's as can be expected when recording for up to 5 hours. Apparently there are velour pads available that you can swap out for the included pleather ones, but I did not want to spend that extra bit of cash at the time. Maybe now I'll consider them and update my review in the future. But for now, I'm very happy with them, and they are well worth the price. They feel sturdy, look professional, and don't leak sound all that much. While they don't stand out like other brands, they have a low enough profile so as to not be the target of theft, as a few friends of mine can attest to having their Beats stolen when they weren't looking.<br /><br />Also, I wear glasses, and the included earcups do not irritate at all.
