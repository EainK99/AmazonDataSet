This is the first set of strings I have bought for a loaner violin that I am starting on. I was unaware that the e string would not be dominant like the others, but now I see where my understanding of the item was flawed. I am still very new to playing the violin, but the strings sound wonderful. They are much louder than the set I replaced. I have much more confidence in my progress with this fresh set of strings.
