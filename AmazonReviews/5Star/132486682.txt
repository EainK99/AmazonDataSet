\\"Through the rain<br />and all the clatter,<br />under the Freemont bridge,<br />I saw a pigeon fly,<br />fly in fear<br />from a raptor<br />come to take its life.<br /><br />And as it closed,<br />In for the capture,<br />Funnelled the fear through my ancient eyes,<br />Se in flight what I know are the bitter mechanics of life.<br /><br />Under my hat,<br />it reads<br />the lines are all imagined.<br />A fact of life<br />I know<br />to hide from my little girls.<br />I know my place amongst<br />the bugs and all the animals.<br />And it's from these ordinary people<br />you were longing to be free.<br /><br />In my hotel,<br />and on the TV,<br />a preacher on the stage<br />like a buzzard cries<br />out a warning,<br />Of phony sorrow.<br />He's trying to get a rise.<br /><br />Cyanide, from an almond,<br />Let him look at your hands,<br />get the angles right.<br />Ace of spades,<br />Port of Morrow,<br />life is death<br />is life.<br /><br />I saw a photograph<br />of Cologne in '27,<br />and then a postcard after the bombs in '45.<br />Must have been a world of evil clowns<br />that let it happen.<br />But now I recognize,<br />dear listeners,<br />that you were there<br />and so was I.<br /><br />Under my hat, I know<br />the lines are all imagined,<br />A fact of life I must impress on my little girls<br />I know my place amongst<br />the creatures<br />in the pageant.<br />And there are flowers<br />in the garbage,<br />and a skull<br />under your curls.\\"-shins
