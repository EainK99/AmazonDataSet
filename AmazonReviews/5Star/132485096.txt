I dj at weddings and other fun parties and the old mic set i had wasnt getting the job done it kept going in and out and had a lot of feed back so i started looking for a replacement and these sure did the trick they are crystal clear and they work from a pretty good distance away making my job a lot easier. These are exactly what i was looking for.
