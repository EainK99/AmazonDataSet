I needed something cheap and a step up from the &#34;rollout&#34; portable piano that I had been toying with for a month.<br /><br />Enter this electric piano distributed by DirectlyCheap.<br /><br />I had been all over the nearby area looking for a store or dealer that could help me with my next piano purchase (my first). After finding nothing but a grand piano distributor, I ended up coming back to Amazon and found this item.<br /><br />It's the perfect gateway instrument for me to pursue more of my musical education. If you're a student of music and want something more expensive and better sounding, then there's a piano distributor in my area that would love to talk to you. But, if you're a self-taught novice who just learned a couple of songs and want to learn more on a budget - this portable's for you.
