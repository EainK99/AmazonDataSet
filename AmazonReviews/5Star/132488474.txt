This toggle switch cavity cover plate is obviously meant to be secured to the back of a Gibson Les Paul and to that end, it would be just fine. However, I placed mine on the rear toggle switch opening on a Dean EVO 60 guitar. My Dean guitar was purchased used and its cover was broken. The screws that secured the original switch cavity cover plate on the Dean guitar are a bit larger than the supplied screws/meant for a Les Paul. So in order for the screw holes to line up exactly, I did have to enlarge/minor drilling for the 3 holes just a bit, in order for this plate to accept the larger Dean screws. But beyond that, it looks great. And, it was reasonably priced and if you have amazon prime, it will be at your door in two days time.
