I needed a piece of furniture for a bare corner in my living room. The Suzuki Mini Grand piano is an awesome instrument as well as a beautiful piece of furniture and it just happen to fit the ticket. I receive lots of compliments as someone walks thru my door and spots it. You can tap out many tunes on it and it also plays itself. I have heard some remark, on other websites, that it does not compare to a true \\"baby grand\\" piano. Fine, they can shell out the $8,000 plus for a true baby grand, but for the price, the Suzuki sounds fantastic. This has been the center of many of my home parties and many of my guests have played it and commented how real the \\"feel\\" of the keys are and that the sound is impressive. The lacquer finish is also quite beautiful. Again, for the price, you can't find a better 'digital keyboard' in an exceptional piece of furniture.
