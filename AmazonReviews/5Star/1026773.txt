Beautiful 1/2 size dreadnought.  The craftsmanship is what you might see in a Martin or Taylor.  The sound hole is finished rounded clean not just a hole cut out.  Someone took pride in their work.  Plus, the same excellence to detail is found everywhere on this guitar.<br /><br />Next comes sound.  I admit that when I first got it I knew I would need to try to kill as much potential thin sound due to the body size.  Although the strings that come on it are D'Addario 10-47, for me I needed a meatier sound and depth.  For the majority, it would be ready to go straight out of the box.  However, I went to the next level string 12-52 size.  This guitar is not just for a beginner/child.  I'm an adult big guy, but I don't have thick fingers.  Once I adjusted the neck just a little I got the sound and play ability I desired.  I have about 40 guitars that range from the lower price to high end, both electric and acoustic, but I've never played anything so small yet so professional sounding both finger picking and strumming.  Again it's not a full size guitar but it's also not a toy.  It's the real thing just smaller.  I bought it for me to play and be more mobile when needed.<br /><br />I get nice rich sound for such a small guitar.  I am buying another one but with the mahogany top to see how the two compare.  I plan to keep both.  For a child that is serious about learning, this is a must have guitar.
