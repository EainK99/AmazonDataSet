Yeah, they are on the cheaper side, but for the money you can't beat them. All of mine worked fine, and honestly lets you test each key before you spend big money on the particular keys. I'm pretty happy with it and would recommend it for someone just getting into it. You can definitely tell the quality difference from others, but again for the money...come on...great deal!
