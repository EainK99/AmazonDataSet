I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday as he was carrying around a long level pretending it was a guitar.  He has not put it down since he opened it last night.  I found a tuning app to tune it and he has sat strumming it all morning.  It's a little big for him, but it is something he can grow into and learn about music while doing so.  This is a great introductory instrument for young children.
