This inexpensive stand does the trick.  It is sturdy and stable.  My daughter keeps it in her room so she doesn't have to dismantle her saxophone ever time she plays it.  Having the instrument so accessible means she plays it more often.  Also, the broad stance ensures the stand and instrument are not tippy - the cats don't knock it over!
