The Alto Ipa is a great device!  It is portable, not too heavy, yet packs tremendous sound with option fr either IPad or IPod use...I have nit used the microphone yet, but it works well and would be great for karaoke or even just a basic PA system.  I could not be more pleased with the unit!  It also fits very nicely on the optional Tripod stand that Amazon carries...a really good combo!
