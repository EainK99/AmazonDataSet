I'm giving it 5 stars because for the price it is perfect the light will not lighten up the room but it does cover your walls with colors which to me is perfect if your going for a club themed party whiCh I am so I purchase 3 this one and two other types I love the fact that this doesnt require a socket you just plug and go... it also came with a hook to hang on the wall which I will be using
