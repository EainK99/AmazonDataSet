If you want to experience you music in a very high level, this is definitely a great option. No signal loss, very strong conectors in a very good price. I bought one American Stage and one of this cable, and both of them exceeded my expectations. So, i think you just have to chose if you want a circuit breaker or not, cause both of them worth the price!!
