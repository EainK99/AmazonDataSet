I've been using cheapie M-Audio keyboards for a while now and was always frustrated by the quality of the keys and the dearth of controls. Doing Hammond-style glisses on them felt like I was going to tear the keys off.<br /><br />The SL MkII has a really great feeling keyboard. Almost as good as my Hammond M3. The high degree of programability of the keyboard makes it a lot easier to use it with Ableton Live 9, Logic Pro X and NI Komplete 9.<br /><br />I wish I'd switched to Novation years ago. I'll pick up one more of these soon and give my M-Audio keyboards to my kids.<br /><br />Update (8/21/14): The keyboard is still going strong. I've had zero issues with it and I've logged a couple hundred hours on it so far (estimate). If you plan on taking it traveling, buy a good case. It'd be tragic to tear off an encoder.
