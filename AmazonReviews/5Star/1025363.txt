I've had this digital piano for nearly a month now and I've been playing it for 30-60 minutes every day, and I'm in love with it. While it's not equal to the Yamaha upright that my daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren have in their home, it is certainly the next best thing to having an acoustic upright.<br /><br />I find the weighted hammer action as well as the look and feel of the PX-160 keys reminiscent of the keys on the Yamaha upright. Casio designed the PX-160 to capture the sound and feel of an acoustic piano, and it seems they've come as close to doing just that as is digitally possible at this time. I own and have owed several different keyboards and synthesizers, and the difference between playing piano sounds on those and on the Privia is dramatic.<br /><br />In order to achieve realistic piano sound, Casio has developed and refined what it calls the AiR or Acoustic and intelligent Resonanator. Casio’s AiR Sound Source is Casio’s answer to the question, “How do you translate the emotional experience of playing an acoustic piano with all its physical and tonal facets to a modern digital piano?” I would say that Casio has succeeded at this translation of emotional experience.<br /><br />The European Casio site has more information on how Casio records piano sounds for their digital pianos than I've seen or been able to find on their US site. There are some interesting and informative videos (some are in German with subtitles) on the site. Also, the best video I've seen to date that demonstrates this Privia being played is by Adam Berzowski (searching adam berzowski px-160 should get you to it). Though Berzowski has the PX-160 connected to external speakers, the built-in speakers have what I consider excellent audio quality. And you can also listen through headphones as you play (there are two headphone jacks, so two people can plug in). Sometimes I don't get a chance to sit down at the Privia until late at night - and I'd rather go to bed late than miss a day playing it - and that is a time when the ability to listen through headphones comes in handy.<br /><br />The PX-160 comes with a music stand, a [[ASIN:B000792SBS Casio SP-3R Sustain Pedal]], and an AC adapter. Because the SP-3R damper/sustain pedal is kind of small, and because I own an [[ASIN:B00063678K M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action]] that is significantly larger, heavier, and better looking than the SP-3R, I use that and it works identically to the SP-3R with the Privia. The Privia was designed to sound so realistically like an acoustic piano that recorded damper noise is programmed into it. The damper noise (the sound you hear when you depress the damper pedal on an acoustic piano) can be turned off.<br /><br />The SP-3R has an L-shaped plug, while the M-Audio SP-3 has a straight plug, and I was concerned that using the SP-3 might therefore require me to keep the Privia out a bit from the wall, but this is not a problem because the angle at which the included music stand sits on the Privia makes it impossible to get the back of the Privia less than about 4&#34; from a wall.<br /><br />The footprint of the Privia (by itself, without the music stand) is 52&#34; x 11.5&#34; and it's 5.6&#34; high by my measurements, and when I weighed it (again without the music stand), I got 25.5 lbs. That's the weight Casio lists it as being, but I weighed it because it felt heavier, e.g., compared to lifting sleeping grandchildren who are between 40-50 lbs.<br /><br />After studying pictures and dimensions of the [[ASIN:B002KG9LX4 Casio CS-67P Keyboard Stand]] that is designed to fit this and some other Privia digital keyboards, I built a sturdy stand out of a piece of scrap oak I'd been holding onto for the past 16 years (and a 1&#34; x 4&#34; x 8' piece of lumber that I bought for under four bucks), and spray painted it satin black, and it looks and works great.<br /><br />Some of the non-acoustic piano sounds included with the Privia - vibraphone, jazz organ, pipe organ, electric pianos, etc. - sound quite good and can be fun to play around with, but I'm most pleased and impressed with the acoustic piano sounds. I'm disappointed with the harpsichord sound.<br /><br />I think the PX-160 would be an ideal choice for anyone who would like to have an acoustic piano in their home but who doesn't have space for it and/or for whom an acoustic would be out of their budget.e fun to play around with, but I'm most pleased and impressed with the acoustic piano sounds.
