Without  a doubt, the finest  mic stands I have  ever used, refereed  to me by a fellow singer/musician ,I bought  2 of them,will never use a boom stand again. My  wife and I travel and sing Gospel  Blue Grass. They  fold up so neatly  and fit perfectly  in a On Stage  stand bag...They  tilt ,raise  and turn easily  with 1 hand .If playing  acoustic ,sit 2 side by side ,lower 1 and lean  it into  your  instrument .And as always  you just cannot beat Amazon.com. Thanks
