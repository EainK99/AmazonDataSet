As stated in my review of the French Horn brush set back in March, this tool in my opinion is the best brasswind cleaner on the market. Now after 6 months of use for both my trumpet and flugelhorn, I'm still giving 5 stars for this product. Yes you have to assist the snake through the valve body, but the green stuff and deposits do come loose. I did not see the flugelhorn snake offered when I bought the product for my trumpet, so I purchased the French Horn brush set for my flugelhorn...works great, very sturdy. Clean the brushes with soapy water after running them through your horns and let them dry for several days before using them again or you may have unpleasant odors coming from the brushes.
