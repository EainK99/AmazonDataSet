Finally all music enthusiasts and performers who give performances sitting cross-legged should heave a sigh of relief - You now have the perfect sidemount boom stand! I noticed a situation where I had to have this boom attached to my microphone main stand which was a &#34;PylePro PMKS40 Universal Microphone Stand with Height Adjustable&#34; which I had purchased earlier. The main microphone stand was also a good, robust and resilient piece but it couldn't be adjusted in height to suit the singer's mouth level since both the singer and accompanists in this case sit cross-legged. Not just that - the 300 degrees rotational adjustability of this boom stand is unrivalled and helps you fine tune the level of the microphone to the optimal level for the best throughput. I don't know what I would have done without this boom stand! I would recommend this boom stand over the traditionally available stands with lever-adjusted sidemounts, also due to one more advantage - this one will also not dent or flake the paint on your main microphone stand although it is mounted at various different positions on the main stand.
