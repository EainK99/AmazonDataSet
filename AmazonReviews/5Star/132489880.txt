Although there aren't a lot of bells and whistles on this controller, it has the essentials.  Used in conjunction with a DAW such as Mixcraft, it is possible to do everything you can with a fancier model -- imagination being the only limiting factor.  Because my workspace is limited, it is so nice to be able to pick it up, plug it in and use it immediately, then easily unplug it, put it back in the plastic bag and get it out of the way.  The piano style keys are comfortable and robust.  I can't imagine requiring more in a DAW keyboard controller.
