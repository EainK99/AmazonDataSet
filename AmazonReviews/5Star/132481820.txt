I've been looking for the right overdrive pedal and I found it. I read that the circuitry in this pedal is similar to the Boss OD3..I took a chance on it because of the price and I have several other Behringer pedals that I like. I was not disappointed. Great sound at a third of the price of the other brand. I love Behringer peals, Great value at a rock bottom price. Highly recommended.
