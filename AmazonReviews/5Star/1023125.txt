Arrived quickly. I was surprised that the product was more substantial, higher quality, than they appeared in the picture and specs.  They hold my MSR400 speakers perfectly. The stands actually state that they can support 100lbs per stand. The bag is nice quality, though I will not likely use it. Very happy with purchase.
