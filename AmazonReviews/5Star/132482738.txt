I love Nirvana, but nevermind them.. this guitar is perfect in everyway if you are inventive and imaginative.....<br /><br /> I write psychedelic/blues/rock and this variant of the  mustang with that fat Jeff Beck humbucker in the bridge, and that really spanky crystalline clean and distorted quack (depending on your slider positions) can give you those dream tones in Hendrix territory with the right pedals, guitar, and amp settings. Especially when the neck and bridge are both on.<br /><br />This is a sleeper blues guitar....really a shock but it can give you fat single note tones or those thin shrill shred tones....<br /><br />The neck is super fast and feels very solid and comfy..quality fender Japan work here..<br /><br />The body is so small and yet the guitar feels. To be more of an extension of you rather then just a.little wood slab with paint and wires ...but it also feels that it wants to be grabbed and dominated..<br /><br />This is a great guitar..nice cross between a stratocaster and a les paul
