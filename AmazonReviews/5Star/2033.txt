It's an alignment gauge for any turntable that uses a 15mm overhang.  It will set your cartridge to an alignment that minimizes distortion for 12&#34; records.  If the effective length of your tonearm is 230 mm and your overhang is 15mm, then this is a tool you need to have to optimize your turntable's playback.<br /><br />Having your cartridge out of alignment not only sounds horrible but can damage your precious, irreplaceable vinyl.
