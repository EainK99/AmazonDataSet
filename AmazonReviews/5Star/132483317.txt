With a great amp like this you don't need a lot of bells and whistles.  Very clean tone with the drive off, and two levels of drive available with separate controls.  Two button foot switch included (drive on/off, and drive low/high).  It is a bit bigger and heavier than some other solid state amps you might see at a jam, but well worth the effort for the results on stage
