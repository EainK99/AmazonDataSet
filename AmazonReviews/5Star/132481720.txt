This uke, was the first one I decided to purchase. It's great for beginners, and seriously becomes such a joy to play. Of course the string will get out of tune for the first week or so because it's new. The sound is amazing, just because it's not $400 dollars doesn't mean it's not a well made instrument. I highly suggest it, plus the bundle is lovely. (:
