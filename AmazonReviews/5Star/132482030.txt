I've had just a few days but it's already a hit.  Everybody wants to use it. I'm going to do a more thorough head to head test against some of my other mics when I get a chance, but so far I'm very pleased with it. The signal is pretty hot for a dynamic, reasonable feedback rejection, and sounds good on both male and female vocals.  As others have pointed out the positioning of the cable connection limits the clearance you have against the mic stand.  Not a problem for me though I did need to unscrew the locking star nut from the arm threads before mounting the mic.  Man, this thing looks good! A small detail, but if aesthetics are important to you put it up on a chrome stand rather than a black one.  If they were cheaper I'd buy two or three more, but I guess $250 seems about right versus the other choices out there.
