Others may pack two coils into a single coil housing, wire them in humbucking-mode and call them noise-less, but sound-wise the Lace Sensors still knock them all out. No humming, no squealing, no need to mount them &#34;in an angle&#34; to reduce wobbling sounds on the low E-string, no need to have &#34;reverse windings & polarity&#34; on the middle pickup for noise-cancelling. The Lace Sensors sound best when mounted as close to the strings as possible, which makes them in fact sound &#34;louder&#34; than any stock pickups, at same or even lower DC resistance. Plus: Lace Sensors make no troubles when used with floor-pedals. What comes out of the Lace Sensors is pure musical tone which makes them a pleasure to play with. The classic &#34;gold&#34; Sensor is still &#34;hot&#34; enough and offers the best of both worlds - perfect clean sounds with enough highs, and dirty enough when used with a distortion pedal. I've been using Lace pickups for 30 years now and I would say in a  Str...t they're still the best on the planet.
