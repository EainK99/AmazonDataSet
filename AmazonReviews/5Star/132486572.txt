My Legacy (in the natural finish) arrived in good condition. I tuned it up and started playing.  The low E string had a bit of a buzz, so I raised the bridge slightly. Later, I read that the neck should be checked first to see if a truss rod adjustment may be needed. The low E string kept going out of tune (going flat even after the other strings had settled down). Then, I found that the same string was out of tune at the 3rd fret. Right now, I am planning on replacing the strings with some decent ones and then see how it reacts. The stock strings sound good and feel good, but may be the source of the buzzing and out of tune 3rd fret. String height seems fine to me, and the guitar plays well. It looks good too. I will do an update after I get the new strings on. If I have to, I'll try to go through the setup process myself. Youtube has plenty of videos on this.<br /><br />12/13/13  I am liking this guitar more the more I play it. I got a set of Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on it a while back, and it did improve the fell and play of the guitar. Love the natural finish too. The stock springs got an indication of rust on them pretty quickly, but I live near Hilo Hawaii, and the humidity can be tough on guitars, books, etc. here. I have taken to wiping off the strings every time I finish playing one of my guitars, and it is helping the problem. I still need to address the intonation problem, which isn't too bad. I wouldn't mind picking up a Legacy Telecaster copy too!
