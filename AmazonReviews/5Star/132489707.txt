If you have  a problem with your drum sticks flying out of your hands and wishing they were glued to you fingers, then this is the solution for you. They were very easy to wrap around my sticks and once put on,they provided a very good &#34;grip&#34;.At first, you wonder if the tape will stay on, put it does.  I even prefer these to the rubber coating that comes on the grips of some drum sticks, as they don't give you the same grip as these wraps offer.
