I don't normally write reviews but I am so impressed with this light that I had too. The amount of light this unit produces is absolutely amazing for an LED light! The first venue I used this in was a 5000sqft building and the entire room was filled with color. It is almost hard to see some of my other effect lighting because this is so bright. Really a great purchase for any mobile DJ. Only downside is that the light  is so bright it is actually difficult for people to look towards the lighting.
