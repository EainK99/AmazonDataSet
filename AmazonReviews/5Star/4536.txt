These replaced our DPA mics and sound MUCH better. It wasn't my decision when the first ones showed up. I've been a pro sound guy for 16 years and the mention of Samson is like garlic holy water on a Lost Boy. I'm a believer! 2 years and even the Countryman's aren't worth the touble. Compared to the DPA there is no contest which blows me away. These are so much more transparent. So far out of 8 mics we've had to replace one cable which is cheap and available on Amazon! This mic is the X32 to the earset world!
