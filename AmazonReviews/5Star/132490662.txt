I bought this capo for my husband as a small &#34;I love you&#34; gift to surprise him. He was happy of course to receive the gift but he said &#34;Its so small, is this really going to work?&#34; Well lo and behold it worked better than the larger more expensive one he had been using. Just make sure to adjust the tension properly. He carries it with him all the time on his keyring, can't beat the convenience of the size of this capo and quality to boot. Good things do come in small packages! This capo strikes just the right key every time! Love it!
