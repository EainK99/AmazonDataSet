My husband and I recently turned our spare bedroom into a guitar room to house his 16 guitars, I bought 6 of these in hopes they would be decent and boy was I surprised! They are amazing quality and so affordable! I would never be able to find these for the price we are paying! Highly recommend these to anyone that wants to showcase their guitars/instruments!!
