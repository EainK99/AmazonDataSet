I'm an absolute newbie to the violin.  My instructor didn't get the spacing right on my acoustic violin when she put three pieces of tape on it for finger positions.  I purchased this as a replacement.  The spacing of the bars (stripes) is absolutely perfect.<br /><br />It confuses my wife because she is used to only the three, but I found it very helpful especially for those notes 1/2 between the main ones. (white stripes.)<br /><br />I bought a second one for my electric violin. It looks a lot neater than the tape and even teaches me the finger positions at the higher octave positions than the three tape version.  Half of what you see can be removed so you don't have the lower stripes, but I decided to keep mine.
