didn't get to use this product.  I bought a DT25 speaker cabinet and it came with a speaker cable.  I bought this P500 in case it didn't.  So I haven't been using it.  The spkr cab item listing didn't mention a cable so I'm out a few bucks.  I started the return process on amazon on day 32 after my purchase and found out there is a 30 day window, so I'm stuck.  5 stars for a probably good product.  1 star for the 30 day return policy.
