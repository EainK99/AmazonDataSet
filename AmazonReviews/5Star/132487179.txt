I bought this guitar 2 months ago. It is my second electric and it was a big step up from my fender strat. The neck is much faster and smother, and the pick ups sound cleaner. Even the strings were really high quality.<br /><br />It came with the guitar and a nice prs maroon case. My only complaints are:<br />-the nut is white and it sticks out so you will occasionally hurt your fingers on the sharp sides of it.<br />-There were no instructions that came with the guitar and I had to experiment with the pickups to find out what they do. (I'm used to the strat labeling them). The left most (when looking at the guitar upright) are the volume: Top is for front pickup, Bottom is for back pickup. The right most buttons adjust the tone respectively.<br /><br />Despite these minor complaints, the bird-inlays are beautiful and the body is quite smooth and high-quality.<br /><br />This guitar could not come at a lower price!
