I run a small sound company where our primary focus is audio. I needed a few small LED moving heads to add to list and considered many. For the price the Chauvet Intimidator Spot 250 are incredible small format, BRIGHT LED moving heads. I was easily able to cover a 10,000sqft ballroom with only two lights (mind you this was only ambient lighting, just a few gobos spinning around the room) Still amazed with these units every time I take them out. I have 4 now and play to expand by adding more in the intimadtor series. Great work Chauvet!
