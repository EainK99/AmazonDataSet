I've owned multiple fixed boards over the years, but I much rather stick with individual effect units*** I've purchased a few empty boards and they wound up falling apart, then it's deep six time *** My brother-in-law purchased the GPTBLPWR as a X-Mass gift 5 years ago, and much to my surprise, it's still kicking ass*** I've dropped it a few times, it's been accidentally stepped on a few times, kicked around numerous times, but after all this abuse, she's still rockin' as hard as ever *** Yes, it's heavy, Yes, the power cord is a bit flimsy, but I think I can deal with those negatives*** Actually, I upgraded the power cord to a heavier gauge which only cost me an extra 5 bucks and a little of my time *** I'd totally recommend this product  to anyone who is constantly on the move with there gear *** The cool thing about this is that when my bro-in-law purchased it 5 years ago, it was only $89.95 *** To bad guy's, you should have taken a chance back then, you could have saved  a little change, but all in all, it's very worth every penny*** You won't be disappointed, I can guarantee it *** Thanks again Amazon / Gator for another job well done ***
