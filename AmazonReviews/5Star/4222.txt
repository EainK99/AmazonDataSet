This mic seems like it has more low-end than comparable mics in the same price range (which I really like). It's really durable and looks great on stage - and did I mention how great it sounds?! I do about 150 gigs a year and this is my favorite mic in the quiver at the moment. I can't wait to try it out in the studio on different applications. I'll definitely buy another!
