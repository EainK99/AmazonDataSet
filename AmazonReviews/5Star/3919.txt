I bought this for my Yamaha P115. It was super easy to build (and subsequently break down when I needed to move it a week after I bought it). It looks great, functions the way it's supposed to, and there's not a lot more I can say about it. If you have a white P115 like I do and want a good looking stand to go with it, I absolutely recommend this stand.
