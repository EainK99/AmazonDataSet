This cymbal arrived in pristine condition, sealed in a plastic bag, unlike a number of cymbals I've purchased from a well known on-line seller that arrive ostensibly new, in open bags, showing nicks, scrapes and finger prints. The Wuhan 15&quot; Light Ride is a superb cymbal, producing a fast, bright explosive crash with a crisp timbre and quick decay. There is no sonic evidence of &quot;trashiness&quot; or &quot;cheap&quot; qualities. This cymbal registers beautifully on recordings, standing out in the mix and holding its own with other cymbals that cost twice or more than twice as much. I've only been surprised and delighted by the Wuhan cymbals I've purchased. This one is just terrific. Kudos!
