I just bought the AKAI EWI USB, and added it to my studio setting. My studio consists of Korg Kronos 88 keys, along with a dedicated windows 8 desktop, with Cubase 7 installed on it.<br /><br />I was quite concerned that it might not work with my settings, due to the many many reviews I read stating that It does not work on Windows 7 or 8.<br /><br />* Windows 8 compatibility:<br />Windows 8 immediately recognized the instrument when I plugged the instrument into a USB port on the desktop computer. Windows 8 installed automatically all the drivers for the AKAI EWI USB without asking me any questions. I did not need to install anything in advance. I did not need the CDs or any downloads from AKAI's website. The midi driver seems to be included in windows 8 almost immediately.<br /><br />* Cubase 7 compatibility<br />Cubase 7 immediately recognized the controlled as a midi controlled. It accepted 4 different types of inputs from the AKAI EWI USB:<br />1. the midi note played<br />2. CC 11 the expression (the strength of your breathing)<br />3. Pitch bend (the thumb placer on the buttom of the AKAI EWI USB is actually a pitch bender, fully functional)<br />4. The pressure of the bite on the mouth piece.<br /><br />* Korg Kronos compatibility:<br />This came as a surprise. When I connected the AKAI EWI USB to the USB B port on the back of the Korg Kronos, it accepted it immediately, and I was able to immediately begin playing. The Kronos has the EX3 woodwind and brass collection, and they sound phenomenal with the AKAI EWI USB. Korg Kronos is manipulating the sounds and taking full advantage of breath, bite pressure, pitch bend, and expression capabilities, and the sounds of this collection sound much better with real \\"breathing\\" midi input.<br /><br />* Ease of use:<br />If you have ever played a recorder in school, you will feel right at home with this one. The feel is almost identical, though the keys are more sensitive. This is a plus, because it allows very rapid playing.<br /><br />* Price:<br />This is a highly recommended purchase. The price is phenomenal for this set of features.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001MTKAD0 Akai EWI USB Wind Instrument Sythesizer Controller]]laying.<br /><br />* Price:<br />This is a highly recommended purchase.
