Inherited a few 78's from the in-laws and wanted to record them. Needed a cartridge to play them on. Found out this one will do the trick. And it did. No problems with the instillation onto the extra head. I set the arm weight and off we went. Neat stuff. I've used Shure since I was a kid and that was a long time ago. Still use them. Still good.
