Besides being very very pretty and well made, the strings have a bright, clear, lovely sound. This is a great relief; all 6 strings sounding great. Its a bigger size, i'm used to the 3/4 size so i have to get used to that.The inlay is not all abalone, which I would of been even nicer. It took me a week to get it. But overall, it's a great deal, and a great sounding guitar. Also a very very pretty guitar with a good weight.Get it,it's original looking for a guitar,most are so plain looking-this 1 has style.
