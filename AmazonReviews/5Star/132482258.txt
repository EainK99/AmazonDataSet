I bought this mouthpiece for my daughter's clarinet.  I then tested it on that and many other clarinets, and have been consistently impressed with its performance in every way.  It's a fine all-purpose mouthpiece, whatever your skill level.  It makes a very sophisticated sound, plays well in tune, handles all ranges, dynamics and colors well.  Frankly, it outperforms a number of professional model mouthpieces of other makes that I've tried over the years that cost many times the price.  You can't go wrong with choosing a Fobes Debut!
