I love this Chieftain A.  It is less 'chiffy' than the high D.  The high D is extreme, but the A is nice and mellow.  the chiff it does have is a nice character to the tone.  very responsive and playable through two octaves.<br /><br />I would do all my business through Hobgoblin if they carried all the instruments I needed.  They are very reliable and respond very quickly and politely to an questions.  They are very helpful as well
