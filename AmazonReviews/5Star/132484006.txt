Sand , paint ,assemble, play !, it's that easy, I had it finished and ready to gig the next week!, Of course I had to get some headstock<br />decals for it, after all it is a &#34;Gibson&#34; SG, But they never made a &#34;Gemini&#34; like mine!, . Almost every guitarest at the place wanted to<br />know &#34; Where did you find this AX ?&#34;, &#34;I made it &#34; was my replie, everything is there pre cut, drilled, centered, you can paint it, stain it,<br />but sand first!!, it sounds great, plays great, really, really happy with my kit!!
