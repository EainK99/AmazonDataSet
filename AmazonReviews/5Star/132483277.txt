I owned a 71' Precision years ago. Same set up, C neck, clear coat finish ( minus the cigarette burn ). The only real difference is that the neck had heavy lacquer, and this one is unfinished. I traded it for a Diaon , and loved the Daion, but always regretted losing the Fender. This bass plays, feels, sounds and looks like the P bass I had so long ago. For $ 279??? I feel like I robbed it!  Play it like you stole it because you did if you get one while they lasted!
