I am a girl.<br />I play in a band.<br />So when my first amp is 6 inches tall and adorable, I knew I was propagating some stereotype somewhere.<br />Whatever, it's 20$ and sounds GREAT.  I play ukulele and saw through that in punk rock bars and they come out sounding fantastic.<br /><br />I'm not competing with larger amps though, but this could be a great practice amp or whatever for tenor ranged instruments (not sure how it'd handle bass).<br />I have two now, and I love them.<br />Also BATTERY OPERATED,  I keep a spare 9V on hand, but haven't needed to change it out yet.
