We ordered this violin for our 5 year old daughter. It is a little large for her, we should have ordered the 1/8 th size. Our violin instructor was very surprised at how well it sounded. The bridge did arrive set, but I did adjust it some. There are plenty of videos on how to adjust it. The strings were a little slopily set, but I restrung them one at a time so the strungs would not scratch the box. I also used a no2 pencil to graphite the bridge and nut to make tuning easier and used some peg dope to help the pegs stay put. Then I used a free app for the iPad to help me tune it. Our instructor was surprised at how well tuned it was, which is good, because I have no ear for tone... I had ordered this size based on what a local music shop had recommended. I realize now that they recommended 1/4 size, because that is what they had. Normally I would rather buy locally, but in this case the music store barely was interested in selling the violin, that was the wrong size anyway, and $200 used. The way I saw it, the price on amazon was right, the return policy is good, and there are more sizes anyway. For the price we are going to buy a 1/8 th and keep this one for when she is a little bigger.
