You can get some beautiful tones out of this pedal. Warm and sweet delay, just like hot glazed donuts!!<br /><br />The deal is, the controls are VERY sensitive. If you are on of those who play with the exact same settings always (specially tempo), you might not like the pedal. But if you don't do this perfectionist shenanigans, you will love it.
