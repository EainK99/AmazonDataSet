After 30 years of playing, I purchased the Kala KCO3 as my first tuner. I keep it clipped to the head of my guitar and it has been extremely reliable. Works great on my guitar without the need for any volume or plugging in the amp.The color code design lets me confirm tuning in poor lit rooms. I should've got this years ago!!!
