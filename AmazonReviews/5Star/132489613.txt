Ok so let me explain what is not said in the description. Theses picks come in different colors DEPENDING ON WHAT SIZE PICKS THEY ARE!<br /><br />The 1.14mm = dark pink<br />The 1.5mm = light purple<br /><br />etc...<br /><br />The picks create a \\"bubble\\" sound for the electric guitar and is the perfect sound for solos. This pick is not necessarily the best for chords (in other words rhythm guitar players) but do not get me wrong, they still make solid chord sounds. They are just not the best picks for chords. I use a different pick whenever I am playing rhythm guitar parts and I know I am not going to solo during a song. These picks are also very accurate, meaning that they always hit the string I am trying to strum very easily compared to other picks. The only two complaints I have is that the picks do not have the best grip in the world (I still love them but some people are picky), and that they only come in \\"girly\\" colors (pinks, purples, baby blues, and so on).<br /><br />Overall these picks are amazing and I highly suggest buying them if you are looking for a brighter and better sound for solos in rock, country, blues, metal, jazz, etc.
