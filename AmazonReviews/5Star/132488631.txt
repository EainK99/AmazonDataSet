I'm a novice, only been playing since May, I'm still way wet behind the ears. But after getting a silvertone rockit kit , I wonders what a better guitar is like, so I looked and came across dis. It was only 415 dollars. I hopped on it after pondering it for a couple days, too good not to buy... It was a deal.<br /><br />  But for the sake of rating it , music 123 bargain, arrived timely enough,perfect cond. Then I removed the ernieballe tag pre stretched den tunedem in.  Every thing about this guitar obviously is  hi. Quality, Duncan's, schecter lockin tuners, big ass frets ,  well made smoothe satiny nice, the back side is darker brown and nice satin from bottom to top seamless in apperance. I'm still learning but now I have a sweet guitar. These pick ups have a nice range, thell be clean and brite ,too fully cranked up feedback and crazy stuf ,  I'm sure a well seasoned player would like the sound  feal  and over all function of this guitar....  I still been playin with my silvertone  , this shecter is makin me appreciate  how good  a cheaper guitar can be, I have ball xtra skunks and had to smooth the frets but the silvertone ain't halfe bad now, but the schecter is a tite insrument, no doubt.
