I am in love with my new headphones. They almost never leave my head! You get premium studio sound quality for a reasonable price! Don't take these to the gym if you sweat though, it'd be a shame to ruin such nice headphones. Also one downside is that the cable is not detachable at the top... But it shouldn't be a problem for me anyways. They look good too so all those people walking around wearing &#34;beats&#34; you can show them your optimum sound quality and style for a fraction of the cost! :D
