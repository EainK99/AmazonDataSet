Although I like to Elixir strings on my guitars, these make excellent replacement strings for that Delicate E string that always breaks before its time. There is nothing wrong with D'Addario strings I just prefer Elixir but I cannot purchase Multiple complete packs just for the E string. I like the Idea of purchasing separated strings to have the right amount of spares.
