I was looking for a mic boom that was very flexible and easy to use.  Rehearsing in my studio I do a lot of changing from sitting to standing.  This makes if effortless.  It was also flexible in it's setup options. It's fantastic that the mic chord is already in the boom.  I ended up using the vertical extender so it would move unimpeded over my mixing board. I have this, and one regular boom stand in my studio setup.  I plan on buying another one of these to replace the standard boom.  This is the way to go in a studio--especially for the price.
