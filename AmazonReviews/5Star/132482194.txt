Exactly what I needed. I've only had it for the weekend, but the crocodile tail is a high quality product. The instruction manual is not in English, but it is available from the manufacturers website. It works precisely as you'd think just by looking at it though.<br /><br />I have an overdrive and delay/looper fetish. I can now permanently cable it all up and save patches, or manually control the gear in &#34;direct&#34; mode. I don't gig, so I can't speak from the standpoint of a pro in the traveling circus. But I think this switcher would do great on a professional gigging pedalboard.
