I use these picks (one at a time) for playing claw hammer banjo. It obviates the need to grow ones fingernail on the middle or index finger of the right hand i.e. it substitutes for a fingernail. If you play claw hammer and for some reason are not able to grow those nails long, then these are the picks for you. They are better than just wearing a frgular pick backwards. Also, they are easily bendable for any size.
