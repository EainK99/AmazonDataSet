Great Value for the price!  I play bass (I have a five-string bass and a Kala U-Bass), and wanted a quick and easy way to jam with my girlfriend when she picks up her ukulele.  Sometimes setting up the amp is a hassle, so I wanted to pick up an acoustic bass.<br /><br />This does the job, and at only $95 with Prime 2 day free delivery, I have no complaints.  Sure, there's a little bit of fret buzz on the low F, F#, and G, but to be able to pick it up and jam spontaneously, these slight drawbacks are a non-issue -- at least for me, haha!<br /><br />I don't know if this instrument would be good for recording, (and when plugged in you'll have to be careful to avoid fret noise -- Fingerease or a little coconut oil should help keep the squeaks quiet) but for just playing around the house, it's a wonderful addition to our collection of instruments.
