i needed a bag for my 13x7 snare drum. this wasnt the right size, but i couldnt find the right size.<br /><br />when i was online i bought this product for around 5.00$USD! i couldnt believe they could sell it for that cheap!<br /><br />when i received it, i was surprised that it was actually good quality! (i was thinking it was going to be one of those 1-ply vinyl drum bags that fall apart after one show)<br /><br />complete with super strong zipper, handle, and strap!<br /><br />a great buy
