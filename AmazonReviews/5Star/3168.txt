I got these as I wanted high quality headphones to handle between 2-8 hours of use a day, and ended up settling on these due to build/sound quality.<br /><br />Pros: build quality, sound quality, nice carrying case, sounds amazing with a amp/DAC, strong base, nice design, sound-proofing<br /><br />Cons: can give you headaches on account of tightness around the ears if you don't adjust the cups often, same deal with the band on the top of the head<br /><br />Other thoughts: all the base in these headphones is gone when wearing with glasses, I have to wear mine so they rest atop the ear cups<br /><br />Overall, I love them and use them countless hours everyday between/after classes
