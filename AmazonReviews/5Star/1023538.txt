This is my third or fourth, since I have given some as gifts.  It is well made, plain (so I am not installing a billboard for some company on my wall) and holds safely guitars and ukuleles, including some fairly heavy guitars.<br />It is simple, understated and has a soft cushioning to protect the neck.  I trust it with my Martin!<br />One caution:  in very dry climates, or while running dry heat in winter, either use a humidifier, or put your valuable guitar in the case. Leaving out wood in very dry conditions will eventually lead to shrinkage and cracking.  I used one of these at my office for my Backpacker, which had been signed as a Father's Day gift from my daughter.  The backpacker can be a bit awkward to hold, but this is a keepsake as she was a little girl who saved her money and got this for me.  I erroneously thought that the backpacker was resistant to dry humidity until I learned otherwise.<br />My daughter is older now, and sees it hanging on the wall in my home, unaware of the crack.  Hopefully, she will not read this review!  The top statge guitar keeper is well made, reliable, and with anchors, will screw in well into the wall and keep your instruments safe. Just beware the humidity conditions should you choose to leave out your instruments full time.
