The JEBSENS - CGS5 New ClipGRIP Stemcap Bike Mount I got for my Samsung Galaxy really feels like a solid mount.  The material is a sturdy metal (maybe a bit heavy if you're very concerned about that), and the phone case itself wraps nicely and securely around the phone.  And for the first month of use, it was perfect.  Even potholes at high speed didn't come close to knocking the phone out.<br />I would easily give the product 5 stars, but the first unit I received became wobbly after about 6 weeks.  Jebsens showed superior customer service in providing a replacement unit which has performed excellently.
