Nice headphones. These have a nice, solid sound for the price point. They are nice and comfortable, blocks out a lot of outside noises and there is no annoying cable noise when you move or jiggle the cable around. I have found that these headphones sound better when they are hooked up to a nice, strong signal source (like a receiver or a high quality sound card on a computer). When hooked up to an iPod, they sound ok, but the signal doesn't seem to be hot enough to really push these drivers like they should. Right now I have these hooked up to a Sound Blaster SB1560 (USB sound card) and they sound really good. I turned up the volume on this thing and these headphones do not distort very easily. I can get the volume up to 78% before I start to hear any distortion out of them. *NOTE* These do not have anything resembling a deafening bass response. The bass response on these headphones are balanced with the mids and highs and sounds clean and tight. If you are looking for something extremely punchy and boomy, these are not for you. If you are looking for balanced and clean sound, these are for you. Just remember, these perform better with a strong, clean and hot signal.
