The Gold Tone CBS banjo Stand is a unique looking support device for your banjo.<br />Nicely constructed from wood and metal, it folds compactly in seconds.<br />The superior feature is that it will support your banjo on it's metal ring and not on the wood resonator which would cause stress on the wood. Nice job Gold Tone!
