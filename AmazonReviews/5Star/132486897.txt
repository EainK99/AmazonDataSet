I love this music sampler. Note: You need to buy the 3.5mm headphone cable to 1/4 inch audio cable adapter (e.g. this one [[ASIN:B003VGUGBS AudioAdapt Quality Headphone Adapter Stereo]] ) so you can listen to your sampler with headphones.<br /><br />I love the wide array of effects you can apply, and one of my favorite things is that this sampler has a sensor that lets you wave your hand in the air to apply additional effects. I don't know what the name of the effect is, but my favorite one is when you bring your hand vertically closer to the roland sp-555 sampler, and the treble starts decreasing so you only begin to hear the bass.<br /><br />Maybe I love it so much because it was my first and only sampler, so I don't know what I'm missing out on? But it is fantastic as a standard sampler with the essential features and a little more.<br /><br />And as for the reviewer that said you can't apply additional effects - that's true, and for a pro that might be annoying. One workaround (although not super efficient) - is to save the new sound once you apply an effect to it. Then, you can apply a new effect to the recording that already had an effect applied to it. So essentially you are applying an effect on top of an effect.
