Very easy setup for it. Slight issue with one of the bolts being too loose to hold up the Blue Yeti, but that was an easy fix. For a cheap product it is very well made. For anyone wondering if it will work with the Blue Yeti, it comes with a black plastic piece to fit the Blue Yeti or any other products.
