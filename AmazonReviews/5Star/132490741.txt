I ordered this when my kids decided they wanted to learn to play piano and I'm impressed. I played quite a bit when I was younger and through grad school and I like the feel of the keys very much. I was worried about not getting a &#34;real&#34; piano, but after having had this, feeling the keys, I'm quite happy to give up the idea of trying to maintain humidity and getting tuners out to deal with the &#34;real thing&#34;.<br /><br />The sound is acceptable. You'll never mistake this for a grand piano, but then again I'm no virtuoso. I'm a reasonably good amateur and for me this is fine for practice, especially at night after the kids are in bed. I'm still loving the headphone jack for quiet practice times for me. Even the speakers are fine for a medium sized room and for kids used to music from an iPod.<br /><br />Most importantly, the kids are doing well with this piano. They have their lessons on a very nice upright, but they practice on this and have no trouble with the feel of the keys or the tone. Overall, a solid purchase that will last the kids quite a while.
