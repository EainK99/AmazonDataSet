Tired of lugging her violin back and forth to school we looked into a back-up option.<br /><br />Everything works as advertised.<br /><br />This thing is awesome.  We pump the audio through my guitar amp and effects and the daughter is having so much fun with it that she practices so much more now.<br /><br />Set-up takes a tiny amount of skill.  The bridge needs to be placed and the strings tuned.  The pegs hold well and the fine-adjusters have given me no problems.
