I recently purchased this and have been using it to lay down some acoustic tracks with Garageband iOS. The guitar plays great and sounds like an instrument that could cost much more than it's price tag would suggest. Previously, I had a Takamine (acoustic only) and this Washburn is a much finer instrument. I'm really surprised that there have been no other reviews here so I wanted to let folks know if they're looking for a really nice-sounding acoustic/electric (Fishman pickup system), I don't think they'll find a better value than this guitar. I can hardly wait to do some more recordings with it!
