Bought this for my son. REALLY impressed with this one. Much more power than I thought. How does it sound? Fantastic. He's used it live and we've done some recording with it. It's small enough to be convenient, but powerful enough to be practical. We're happy. The difference between this one and the one right below it is pretty big.
