We use this for Rock Band party nights in the man cave.  Pretty awesome.  It is a little larger than I probably should have purchased as it's too loud if you don't choke up on it a bit.  I made a homemade hook attached to the mic stand that holds this and the tambourine.  Really cool!  I made a beat stick for it out of an oak dowel rod.  Easy and rocking the house!  Fun Fun.<br /><br />It's definitely robust, thick metal.  Expect it to last forever.
