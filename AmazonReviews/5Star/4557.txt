I have been using this power supply for over eighteen months with no issues whatsoever. I'll get the one thing you need to consider out of the way first: this is bulky and will take up an entire double electrical outlet. I use mine on a surge suppressor strip that has wall wart spacing, so that's not an issue for me.
