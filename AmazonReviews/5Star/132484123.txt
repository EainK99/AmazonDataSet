I love my new bass! The ONLY thing I was upset about was the obvious abuse from shipping. The poor bass needed (and still needs) a serious neck and Truss Rod adjustment. I have learned the hard way not to try to fool with those things myself, even though I've been playing guitar for close to 25 years now. Some people are very skilled at this sort of thing and should always be referred when there is a need.<br /><br />I would recommend this bass to anybody looking for a solid upgrade from their current instrument, an awesome Studio addition, for touring and for really anything. The pickups are great. I was worried about them but since the electronics are Active, it has an awesome, thick and punchy tone straight out of the box. I can drop a set of EMG MM series bass pickups in there and have a fully Active bass guitar for less than $1,000!<br /><br />Buy this bass!
