Well oh my goodness this cartridge lives up to its hype for sure! Better quality, higher output and better cueing than the standard stylus that came with the turntable. Some records that skipped at certain points with the other one play all the way through with this one. Another thing is it handles the inner grooves better where naturally sound quality has to suffer because of the room at the end of the disc and makes them sound pretty good depending on the record. I definitely recommend getting this elliptical cartridge if you want pristine sound quality. And I got it in time for my birthday today so I'm triple time happy!
