This is exactly what I needed. I am in a show-style band and this is what all of our snare drummers use. It's adjustable, length-wise. It can fit anyone from shorter than 4.5ft to people taller than 6ft. It's made of nylon, making it extremely durable. Since it's black, you don't have to worry about it getting dirty.<br />  Our marching band has our snares on our left legs, so we use the left side hook to close the strap. This strap also has a right side option, if your band uses the drum on your right leg.<br />All in all, I can't find a single thing wrong with this strap and I think you couldn't find a better one anywhere.
