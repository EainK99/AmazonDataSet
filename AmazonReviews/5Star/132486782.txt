This Johnson met my four requirements in a travel guitar: 1) fit in the overhead of a plane, 2) stay in tune (while playing and overnight), 3) sound good enough, and 4) easy to play while sitting down.  Best of all, it's priced at $100.  I did look at the Martin Backpacker, but it was too hard to hold, and the Washburn Rover was not only hard too find in person, but it also has a reputation for having a bad smell.  That said, both are priced much higher and did not meet all my requirements.  After a week traveling around Alaska and Canada, I can tell you from experience that I wrote 5 songs (picking and chords) on it --- never did I feel like I was missing out, and it did a hell of a job traveling with me.  Once I came home, I played the songs on my full size acoustics; the songs were greatly enhanced.  The one gripe I have is about the case --- it's a soft \\"backpack\\" case with a pocket, handle, and adjustable shoulder strap, but it is not insulated AT ALL to protect the guitar.  That said, take good care of where you store the guitar when you travel and how you carry it, and all shall be fine.  Otherwise, this is the king of all travel guitars!!!
