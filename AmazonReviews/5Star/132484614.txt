I bought this book for the simple reason that I wanted to learn the song my wife and I danced to on our wedding night.<br />A lone street musician sitting just one street down from Bourbon street New Orleans playing as we walked up. He asked if we where newlyweds, and we answered that we had gotten married only a few hours earlier.<br />He played &#34;Wonderful Tonight&#34; And we danced in the street, that was our wedding waltz. He had wanted to play that song for newlyweds for a long time, and finally he got to play it. When he heard it was our first dance as a married couple, he seemed even more flattered and happy...<br />I have always loved that song, but since that night I wanted to learn to play it. I love that song more now then ever and am now learning to play it on the guitar thanks to this book.<br /><br />The list of songs is long as my arm, and the notation and tablature makes it understandable even for me a complete novice on the guitar. It will take me a long time to learn any of Claptons songs. Time I have, and now thanks to this book. I have the tablature, the lyrics and notation.<br /><br />A great book for any Clapton fan.
