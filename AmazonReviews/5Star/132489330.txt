I spent a day with this instrument, so my opinion should be considered \\"at first glance\\". It's been great!<br /><br />I purchased this guitar from Alto Music. I ordered the vintage blonde 51 pawn shop. It has a stratocaster body, telecaster neck, hardtail, no tone control and a push/pull coil splitter for the humbucker. Other specs you can read about in the item details.<br /><br />It came brand-new in-the-box with a nice gig bag. It needs a little work to get it set up to my tastes, but it's totally playable out of the box. For example, the neck needs a bit of an adjustment however that may be due to the dry climate here. Otherwise the neck is nice and tight to the body. The frets are nice and round, no sharp edges to be found. The body looks like it might be made of 2 pieces of wood, however it's difficult to tell. They matched the wood pretty well if that is the case. The finish is perfect, and you can see the wood grain through it.<br /><br />2 minor issues I found with this guitar is that the volume knob is slightly angled, and the guitar jack bolt was a bit loose. The latter I fixed in 5 seconds. The former I may not bother with as it's not that bad.<br /><br />Neck :<br /><br />The neck pickup has a \\"neck\\" strat sound, but it's slightly brighter to my ears than a typical Strat. This makes perfect sense if you know about it's construction. It's a Texas Special pickup that is angled towards the higher strings. It's a hotter-wound pickup, which actually balances pretty well with the very high output bridge humbucker.<br /><br />It's sound is great for distorted lead playing, clean blues, etc.<br /><br />Bridge :<br /><br />The bridge pickup is nice and fat in humbucking mode. It sounds great for lead when dirty. Clean, you can roll off the volume a little and it gives this pickup a brighter jazzy sound. The humbucker has a very high output so I'd imagine it'd be good for metal or heavy rock/blues if played with distortion.<br /><br />The bridge pickup in singlecoil mode sounds a bit spanky, and it's tone is more like a Strat bridge pickup to me than a Tele bridge pickup. I didn't really play around with it much with overdrive or distortion. It gave me some reasonable finger picking / country tones clean though.<br /><br />Neck + Bridge :<br /><br />This is great for strumming or fingerpicking (clean) and has a well-rounded sound. I didn't really care for it overdriven or distorted, but that's my taste. The Neck + Bridge (Humbucker) has less noise (duh!) and sounds pretty much like you would imagine. More bassy tone, less treble. Splitting the coil add's a little extra brightness. Its not really a huge difference, just slight. I think this because the neck pickup is \\"hotter\\" than the split coil and it sort of over-shadows it. The biggest difference between splitting the coil or not in Neck + Bridge is you get a noticeable boost in output by switching on the humbucker.<br /><br />I'd say with the coil split it approximates a neck + bridge telecaster sound, but it's not quite the same thing. You definitely get a little more \\"neck\\" sound.<br /><br />Final word :<br /><br />Owning this 51 Pawn Shop is kind of like having a Strat with a mix of HSS and SSS tone options that don't have the \\"quack\\". The only additional thing it has over a stock strat is neck + bridge settings, which to me were \\"not quite tele\\" but a great sound overall.<br /><br />Great guitar. I've owned mostly Fenders my whole life. I used to have a 52 American Reissue telecaster, and frankly this guitar's finish and quality is up to the same standards. It was an incredible value. If you want a guitar that sounds, looks and plays like it costs twice as much this is a guitar for you.
