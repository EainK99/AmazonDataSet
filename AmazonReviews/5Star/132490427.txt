I bought this case for my Takamine EG340SC. The Chocolate  color matches the deep mahogany wood grain. It is a locking case. The guitar is a little snug but the case has never had a guitar in it and it will take the shape in time. With the guitar in the case the latches don't line up perfect but they will with some break in time. For the most part it appears to be made very well but time will tell on that. I also like having a lock on the center latch with two keys. Plenty of storage but a set of strings won't lay flat in the compartment. I'm not sure but I think I've had that problem with most hardshell cases. I'm completly satisfied so far and a proud owner of a G series Takamine guitar and matching case. I've paid more for less quality so no complaints here.
