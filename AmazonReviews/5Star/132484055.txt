Once you have them mounted to a hanging bracket, leave them attached to your lights/machines and then easily place wherever you want on your light pole with the quick release.  Super smart design and once they're tightened they fell very secure.  I used them with both moving head LED lights and 2 fixed fog machines.  I had no concerns at all that they weren't secure.
