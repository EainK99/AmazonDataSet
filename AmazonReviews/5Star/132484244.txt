This, plus the [[ASIN:B000EENBGC Gibraltar SC-1410WSS 14 Inch 10 Lug Wood Snare Hoop]] companion can transform your snare drum into a dry and woody sound. This works well on wood or metal snare drums and attenuates the ring of even a cheap steel snare drum.<br /><br />Construction is multi-ply maple with non-shaped hoops that are called 'Yamaha' style. These are perfect for cross-sticking and even as a subtle change in effect by playing off the hoop instead of the head. You will lose some sensitivity when playing near the rim, but that is the nature of this style of hoop. If you are playing heavy backbeat music you will not miss the sensitivity and this hoop will allow you to project and cut right through the mix.<br /><br />This hoop will also work on floor toms, but you may run into trouble using it as a resonant side hoop on some models because it may not clear the legs. One additional factor is not every drum key will fit the tension rod holes, into which the rods are recessed. Cheaper drum keys work far better than fancier, heavy duty ones.<br /><br />Bottom line: this and the companion hoop will give you more options when configuring your snare drum. It's not an either/or thing: a pair of these, plus flanged hoops that probably shipped with your snare drum are like having two drums in one. Swapping out one set of hoops for the other is less than a fifteen minute job.
