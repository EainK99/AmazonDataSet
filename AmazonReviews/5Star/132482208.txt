I've had probably about twenty of these sound activated modules in the past, and always end up giving them to someone when i \\"swear off sound activated forever\\" only to get bored with my pc and add a few more in and by the time you know it i have four more modules in my computer flashing away at some techno or other electronic music. Needless to say there are two main sound modules out there. There's the cheap and ever-so unresponsive logisys ones that i've had over 10 break on me just from looking at them wrong. And then there's the Lamptrons that have never failed me in any aspect i have pondered. They're super reactive and adjusting them actually does something unlike their competition. Well worth the 10$ and i will definitely buy again
