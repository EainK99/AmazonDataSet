Far from the best guitar, but I didn't expect more, and it exceeded my expectations. Yes, the finish leaves something to be desired, and the strings - if you adjust them a little bit at a time over a couple hours, they won't break - while they sound 'tinny', replacing them with decent nylon strings and setting the bridge slightly lower (file a couple mm off the bottom and reinstall)  improves everything. Take a look at the headstock, for pete's sake, it's intended for nylon strings, and they sound fine, the action distances improve, and it's easier to play. For the $26, an outstanding value in a practice instrument.
