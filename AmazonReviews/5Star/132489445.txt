Great pickups, great sound, clean or dirty, I love the neck, special when playing the intro of \\"sweet child\\". I finished my project, and these pickups are fine to me, is a good option on saving money, if you don't want to spend on other expensive brands, I recommended for projects, or if you just want to improve the sound on a cheap guitar.
