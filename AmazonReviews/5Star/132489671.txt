We are by far an expert in rating musical instruments, expecially since this is our first child in band and this is her first year in band.  She is just learning to play but the sound it makes with the cords she knows how to play sounds fantastic, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this one and a $1000 or even a $10,000 sax.  Now maybe once she really knows how to play it we will be able to tell.  But if you are looking for a student instrument for your childs first or even second year, this item is perfect.  After she took it to school on her first day, she said other students had rented theres from local music stores for the same cost or more than we paid for this item NEW!  And she indicated hers was the best looking instrument in class!
