I bought this case for my Nord over two years ago.  I play professionally in a touring act, about 180 shows a year.  My case has lasted until just recently, when the corner ripped and padding started sticking out, plus one of the zippers broke.  It has been over two years of extreme use, so for $50/year I protected my Nord from harm.  Need I say more?  Well worth the price, and durable, easy to carry, the backpack straps make it easy for me to load in to a smaller gig in one trip.  If you're opting for a soft case, this is the one you want.  Period.
