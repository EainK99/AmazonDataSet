Backrest- moves with the throne and is in good positioning<br />Seat- Very comfortable especially for a bigger guy, gives the tush the &#34;just right&#34;  feeling<br />Legs- very secure and stable<br />Adjustability/memory lock- confusing and doesn't come with instructions of how to adjust. We haven't done any internet research and I'm sure there is a simple answer to our confusion but it is actually the height needed when put together so no huge drive to find out what we are doing wrong. I think it all comes down to the memory lock.<br /><br />A great throne only drawback is that it isn't a hydraulic lift, but I knew that when purchasing it and no great information of the memory lock with the packaging.<br /><br />Bought this for my keyboard playing guitarist who likes the occasional night of rock band drums. It has worked well for all three above and even has his drummer brother maybe a bit envious that this may be better than his. (which it is :)!)
