I've had two in my possession, the first needed to be replaced because it was damaged in shipping.  Even with the damage and with the second one, the valves move freely and the slides are easy to work with.  The sound is that of a thousand dollar instrument and the metal feels like it it very well made.  With the price and accessories, this trumpet is well worth the buy.
