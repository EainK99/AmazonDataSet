I've been playing Music for years and have a Home Pro Studio.I needed near fields .I have a set of Audix non powered monitors Iv'e had for years.Still use them for my overall mix .I wanted smaller powered speakers to track on. I mostly do Film and TV tracks.These sound great low end for the big Timpani hits ,Bangs,Booms and they have such good clarity its hard to believe for the price.There is enough power there. At 85 DB I turn them up half way.I rave about them to all my friends. I was looking at JBL's But why pay the price they want? I've used them for a week about 6 hrs a day no problem. I like the auto shut off when your not using them also.
