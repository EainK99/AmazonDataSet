Got exactly what I expected. Sound quality certainly could be better, but it is priced accordingly. The lighted keys help quite a bit and are easily turned off if so desired. Works excellent with synthesia! It's a bit frustrating that I had to buy the power cord seperately, but I knew I would need to do this before I purchased the keyboard anyway.<br /><br />Package came sooner than I expected.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Lighted keys help with learning and can be turned off with a single button<br />+ Sound is good for the price<br />+ Lighted keys work wonders with Synthesia software<br />+ Keys don't wobble like other similarily priced keyboards<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Had to pay for power cord and shipping on the power cord seperately, that sucked since I ordered with 2 day shipping<br />- I guess it was a bit heavier than I expected<br />- I think the box it came in looked stupid<br />- Keys aren't weighted, but you shouldn't really expect that with this pricetag anyway<br />- I suck and can't play it very well
