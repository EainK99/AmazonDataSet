I just installed these on my new Taylor 816ce-LTD after reading all the hype about them. Surely, a set of strings doesn't make THAT much difference.  Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />I've used Elixirs on all my guitars for many years primarily because they sound great (still not quite as good as a fresh set of uncoated PB strings but pretty close).  And uncoated strings are maybe good for a couple of weeks before they oxidize whereas I get a couple of months from typical Elixir Nanos.<br /><br />The guitar I installed these on is made of cocobolo, a very dense hardwood similar to koa.  Cocobolo is known for its low end and overall brightness with distinct note separation.  These strings seem to really play to the strengths of this wood but I suspect it has more to do with the GS shape than the tone wood used.<br /><br />Taylor and Elixir should get a lot of kudos for these strings.  However they developed them, they got it right.  It may become a trend to match strings sets to a particular shape, style or type of guitar.  Many guitarists already do this, mixing and matching individual strings to get the sound they want.  I'm not that particular.  I will be using these strings exclusively from now on.
