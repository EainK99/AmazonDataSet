I hemmed and hawed over what to get as I have an Android phone and an iPod but came to the realization that I was going to use my newly purchased SE315 ear buds predominantly with my iPod while mowing the lawn, skiing, and even biking (although not recommended for biking on the packaging).  I wasn't planning to use it for phone calls as I use my Plantronics headset for that which is a much better product for making calls.<br /><br />The cable they offer for Android phones does not have a volume control, only a pause, skip song option (the middle button) so decided to go with the 3-button option since it was going to be used mostly with the iPod.  What I found out later is that the middle button does work on my Android phone as well so I pretty much got the convenience of both cables in one product.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to use if for music control.  I can't comment on its use for phone calls, I'll defer to others who rated it on that basis which from what I read, it wasn't all that great for.
