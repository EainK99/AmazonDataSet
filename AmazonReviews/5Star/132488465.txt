This item was recommended by the social worker at the Veteran's State Home where my brother was a resident.  She said the Vet's preferred this system over actual hearing aides.  My husband tried it out for a week before deciding that he wanted one for himself.  It has made a big difference in his and my life (I don't have to listen to the TV at extremely high volume!).<br />Also, the price was good.  From the day I ordered the device until the day it arrived at our home was a very short time.  I appreciated the quickness of the shipping of this device.  I'm sure that I will use Amazon again in the future for on-line purchases.<br /><br />Sandra Thompson
