Amazing headphones at a great price. There really isn't much else to say. Ear parts are very comfy and I love how the adjustable part is made of metal and not plastic (shows quality to me). Look amazing and is very stylish, but not recommended for actually and solely showing off. It's shining feature is the sound quality. Just great headphones.
