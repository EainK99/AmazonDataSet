I use this with a 5150 lll rig and it sounds great with distortion and very vintage with clean. Always liked the &#34;Man in a box&#34; sound! I have been through many Wahs over the years and although many were good, they just did not sound good with distortion. I can do a 2 string pull and slowly sweep the wah and it is smooth throughout the range. It's a keeper on my board!
