I absolutely love this gig bag. I have an Alesis 49 key keyboard and it fits perfectly in there with still enough room to fit accessories. The padding on the bag is stellar. It's put together very well and the straps on the inside are even better than I thought. The straps have a pad to provide extra cushion for your keyboard, while keeping it in place. The outside pocket will be of good use and the handles are very firm.<br />I'd definitely suggest this to anyone looking for a well-made gig bag at this price range.
