I work the night shift as an RN, and I live in a second floor apartment. On my nights off if I want to watch a movie or play a video game, I'm often up until 4-5am. I don't want to wake the tenant in the place below me, so I bought these to extend the reach of my Sennheiser headphones to my Vizio flat screen. They also come in handy when my noisy dishwasher or AC unit kick on.<br /><br />The only downside I've experienced really isn't: the volume needs to be increased on the TV in order to push sound to the headphones at an audible level. Certainly no huge problem, just be careful when you turn on the TV once the headphones are out of the TV jack.<br /><br />Good quality, solid connection.
