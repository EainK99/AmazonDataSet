Normally I have to fight with harmon mutes to keep them in the bell of my yamaha allegro. I use them to practice since it's hard to find a place to practice I can easily practice where I&#34;m living and it keeps the noise down. But this mute was easy from the beginning I was looking for something different and I found it, very lightweight the sound quality is purer than any harmon i've used I recommend  to anyone looking for something different in regards to mutes.
