I'm an experienced music teacher and public school band director. I played and evaluated the new LJ Hutchens Mark || alto last week. I also had it played by each of the members of the sax section of the big band I play with, all of whom are pros. Reactions follow.<br /><br />| Horn appears well-made and arrived properly adjusted and ready to play. Solders and craftmanship look very good. Hefty and solid feel. Ergonomics are very good. Key mechanisms all felt right under the fingers.<br /><br />| I played it into a tuner with a closed-face mouthpiece and rather stiff reed and it played almost uniformly in-tune with itself. Couple of cents sharp here and there when the wind column is \\"long,\\" like any sax. I thought it produced nice round, colored sound in the low and middle range. Top of the horn sounds good also. Everybody had pretty much the same opinion: For a student horn, this sounds very good and is very satisfactory ergonomically.<br /><br />| The boys in the section all liked the overall sound when they played it. Good sounding horn. Couple of guys thought the action on the keys was \\"long,\\" that is, a long throw, especially in low Bb and B. Compared to the altos I play regularly (an old Conn 6M from the early 1940s and a Yamaha Custom Z) I'd say the action is long. But, again, for 500 bucks, that's a minor issue. The horn speaks easily throughout its range. Palm keys felt pretty good and the uppermost range also sounded good and full. Octave mechanism is fine. Repairmen would prefer adjusting screws for regulation, of course, but for $500 I can understand why that's not a feature.<br /><br />| The manufacturer says the height of the keys will be addressed in the near future.<br /><br />| I would not hesitate to recommend this as a student instrument. For the price, it is perhaps one of the best values in the market. Although made in China (like every student horn now, including Yamaha) the fit, finish, regulation and sound are all characteristic of what we used to find in good American-made student instruments. If cost is not an issue, the Yamaha YAS26 student alto sax is probably still the gold standard. But the Yamaha comes at at a cost of about four times the new Hutchen alto. For the money, I'd select the LJ Hutchen if I had a kid just starting out and move up to an intermediate horn at the high school level.
