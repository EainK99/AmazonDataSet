My granddaughter had a Canto Recorder a few years ago and it disappeared under our deck.  We pulled it out this summer and although it was still okay (not broken, etc.) I really didn't want her playing it.  I went on line and found the exact same recorder for an unbelievably reasonable price.  I ordered two (for two granddaughters) and I am very pleased - comes in nice little bag with instructions and a cleaner and the colors are beautiful.  Would highly recommend.
