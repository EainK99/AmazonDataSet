This is a great tuner, especially for the money.  For little more than the cost of a headstock tuner, you can have a much more durable way to tune during live shows.  The display is very visible and the tuner response is superior to my headstock tuners.  I'm not sure about the accuracy, since I do a little &#34;sweet tuning&#34; anyway, but the Snark pedal tuner gets me very close, without a lot of waiting, while muting the guitar.  What used to be a real chore during live performances is now a lot easier.
