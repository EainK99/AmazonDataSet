This thing is amazing. I have backup singers on demand. One of the first things I did was establish what<br />pitch correction settings I liked. Then I added those settings to the patches already there. Easy.<br />The VL5 does more jobs than what I had expected. You have to experiment.<br /> Good seller too.
