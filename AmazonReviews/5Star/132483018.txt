I ordered this for my very heavy electric bass after reading a review that said this guitar version had a longer wide area. I've never worn a more comfortable strap. Buy it.<br /><br />It was a little too long for my style of playing (I wear it high). I just punched a new hole in the leather and cut the excess off, problem solved. I don't mind altering such an inexpensive strap. I'd do it again.<br /><br />The strap does have a little stretch to it, but not nearly as bad as I feared. It's not really noticeable to me while playing.<br /><br />If you've got a heavy ax and your shoulders need a break try this strap. Or, pay a bunch more for a fancy leather one that may or may not be as comfortable as this.
