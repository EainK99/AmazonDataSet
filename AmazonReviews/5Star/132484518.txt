I had been looking for a nice cymbal boom stand at a variety of different music stores and all of them were pretty pricey. The cheapest one I found was about $45. Then I came across this and thought it was a great deal so I figured I would just go for it. Let me tell you this, these boom stands are great! Not only were the stands perfect, but they also came in almost 2 days early! The only problem I have with them is that the felt rings are slightly thin so you cannot tighten your cymbal all that much. However, that is cheaply and easily fixed so that's only a minor issue. Other than that these stands are a steal!
