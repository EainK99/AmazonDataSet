The Moozikpro Ukulele Strap is a high quality thick strap.  I got the black and it is a nice solid black color.  The leather is rich and stitched very well.   This was for my grandson and he loves it.  The strap is easy to adjust and easy to use.   This strap will last a long time and my grandson will be able to adjust it as he grows.  I received this product in exchange for my review and honest opinion.  The Moozikpro Ukulele Strap is a great strap at a great price.  You will not be disappointed.
