It's great for the price. I had a desktop and needed a mic, and this was great for skype calling and such. I haven't used it for other purposes, I just wanted a simple mic and that's what it is. I'm sure if you're looking for something super fancy there might be something better out there, but for the average person who just wants a decent mic to use that has a good price, here you go!
