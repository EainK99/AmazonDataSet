The Furman SS6B offers advanced features at or below the price of many very basic power strips.  From the outside, it looks no different than a standard switched outlet box, but it's what's inside that counts.  From studying their website, I am convinced that the circuitry used for protection is an improvement over what you might find inside a standard &#34;spike stick&#34;.  The manufacturer has gone the extra mile to design a protective device that not only will withstand many large voltage variations, but also will protect against the more common, low level overvoltages which plague many utility companies.  This translates into longer life electronics and fewer &#34;mystery&#34; failures.  The Furman SS6B comes with a nice long (somewhat bulky) cable and includes a built-in circuit breaker type switch.  These switches are a bit &#34;trip sensitive&#34;, so care should be taken to position the box so that nothing will hit the switch and shut down the power.  Overall, it's not pretty to look at, but things like this should usually be hidden somewhere anyway, and a few of these placed strategically inside your home may just save you a lot of money and heartache.
