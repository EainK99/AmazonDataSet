My nephew's Baby Taylor didn't have top fret markers.  This was awful especially trying to teach him guitar.  He had to count frets all the time.  I put these fret markers on his guitar a few months ago and it's perfect.  Looks like it's part of the guitar.<br />I had enough for marking even the first fret and making the 12ths fret a double mark.<br /><br />the stickers haven't come off yet.  I screwed one up and scratched it off with my fingernail and it didn't leave a mark.  I put another one over that spot and the sticker has stayed on.  Easy to remove, but won't fall off if you don't scratch at it.<br />So far so good.  great investment.
