This was not the case that I wanted, but it turns out to be even better. I live in a big city and this is a perfect case for transporting my instrument to gigs, practices and jams. It's spacious and I suspect it will accommodate almost any F mandolin. My Michael Kelly fits with room to spare.<br /><br />The padding and exterior material are thick and feel quality. I was immediately impressed by both. The zippers are big and easy to find. The pockets aren't as big as I'd like, but most mandolin cases and bags I've seen don't have any pockets at all. This one even has a hidden pocket underneath the reflector strip.<br /><br />The backpack straps are comfortable and can adjust for a wide range of sizes. They can also be unclipped, or you can transform it into a single strap.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't be disappointed with this purchase.
