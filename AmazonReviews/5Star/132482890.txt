Just received this stand yesterday and I was shocked at how small and compact it is. Maybe that's because I am used to seeing full-size guitar stands but it is exactly what I needed! It is made of a seemingly strong ABS type plastic that looks like it could take a beating. It also has some nice rubber padding to protect your instrument. It fits my mandolin perfectly! Then it folds up to a very compact size that *almost* fits into my mando case. I will likely buy a few more of these as I also play the uke.
