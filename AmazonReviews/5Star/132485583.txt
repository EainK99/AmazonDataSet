I bought this mic system for filming YouTube videos with, on a Nikon D5200. After a month of researching whether I should buy a RODE or a cheaper wireless lavalier, I went with this and I do not regret the $600 purchase (although I may have cried a little after seeing my credit card bill the next month). The sound quality is excellent. There isn't a high pitched background noise that you may hear with cheaper wireless lavalier mic systems (I had previously tried the Audio Technica ATR 288W Wireless Twin Microphone and the sound quality was quite bad regarding the background noise). It's very easy to mount on the camera. The only difficult thing about the mic is that you have to (what feels like) smash the wire into the clip holder. At first I thought I was going to destroy the wiring by forcing it in there, but after googling it, it's the only way to get it in the clip.The mic didn't break after doing this, but it would be a lot nicer if there was a D-ring or something to attach the wire to the clip with. Lastly, it comes with batteries! Maybe not a big deal, but it was really nice to not have to go out to CVS for a last minute purchase for something I had not even thought of when the package arrived.
