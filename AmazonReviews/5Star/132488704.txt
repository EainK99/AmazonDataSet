I ordered these for my dorm room hoping to get a little better lighting, and it worked much better than I thought. The LED's are actually very bright and work very well. The 3M tape on the back worked better than I thought as well. I was a little skeptical because everyone in the previous comments said that it was crappy, but it applied and stuck perfectly fine for me!<br /><br />The receiver and remote work perfectly as well. I have the lights mounted (with the 3M tape) up towards my ceiling so therefore I have a cord running up my wall in the corner of my room, but because of that the receiver is (mounted with double sided mounting tape I had lying around) about 6' off the ground so the remote works from anywhere in the room.<br /><br />These lights are really cool and I suggest them to all of my friends, who all think I'm the hottest thing since sliced bread, because of the awesome lights I now have in my dorm.
