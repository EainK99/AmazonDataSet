This effect-box sorta thing works quite well and can be adjusted to produce some nice fuzz or some heavier overdrive sound. If you understand what to do, it helps to modify the original tone of your bass when plugging into it with tone knobs and such, and I've had a very nice time putting it both before and after the Behringer BLE400, though I think I prefer after in most cases.
