We have a big problem with buzzing in the amp sounds while trying to work with a local music store that doesn't carry Monster cables. Every cable we tried would have the buzz and we were nearly convinced by the music store that we needed to have our electric system looked at. I bought this cable as a last resort to all the other brands we've already purchased and the buzz is gone! I bought several other cables also to replace all the junk ones that we were using. This is a high quality cable and from now on I will not buy any other brand.
