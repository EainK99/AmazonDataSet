Great quality and sounds wonderful.  My son would play 24 hrs a day if he didn't have a piano to fill the other half.  He's an instrument 'snob,' and this is one of his favorites. I love the carrying case because it can be taken in the car for road trips.  And yes, it is more soothing than you would think.  Not tinny like other ones.
