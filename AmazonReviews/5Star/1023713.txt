EXCELLENT! I love elixir strings. I had a set on my bass for 8 years! Admittedly, only about the first 4 consisted of regular gigging but even still they sounded great until the last couple years. I also only use Elixir on my guitars. You just can't beat the continuous bright tone, unless of course you are super pro and can afford or want to have your strings replaced for every gig.
