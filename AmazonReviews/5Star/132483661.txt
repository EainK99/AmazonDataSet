Such an awesome find! Bought this uke for my beginning ukulele lessons. My Teacher liked the sound and especially the quality of the woodwork for the price its at. According to him, this instrument has great value and I totally feel the same way! I keep it out and about in our house and everyone picks it up to play almost every day. Now they want one for themselves. I also took it to the beach a few times to play while relaxing. Such an cool portable easy instrument and it looks great! I might just buy 3 more as gifts for xmas.
