Recently I bought on Songbird Ocarina a Zelda's kokiri edition and I recieved it yesterday. All went smoothly and my ocarina sounds great!<br /><br />ABOUT THE PROCESS:<br />Songibird ocarina send me mails frequently about my purchase and more info about the item like how to clean it, etc.. And that was very useful. That made me smile too.<br />Also, amazon did it great too. I could track my package and I always knew where it was (except the last days cause i couldn't see any progress so i worried, but sunddenly it arribed and i felt relieved).<br /><br />When I first opened the package I was touched by how much they protected my ocarina. You can really feel how much they care.<br /><br />ABOUT MY OCARINA:<br />My kokiri edition of songbird ocarina sounds great!! I could sing some Zelda's music and worked perfectly. Smooth, graceful... I love it.<br /><br />I hardly recomend songbird ocarina.<br />Thanks amazon too.
