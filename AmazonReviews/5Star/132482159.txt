I love this mic. It is USB so that may cause an issue if you are trying to incorporate this into a multi mic setup, but if you are a sound engineer and know WTF you are doing then Im sure you will find a way.<br /><br />I have used it directly connected to my pc (Win 8) and my buds pc (Win 7) and it worked great. I have not tested it with a mixer as there wasnt a connection option for usb mic.<br /><br />There is a sound selector mode on the mic. 1,2,3 are the modes. I have tried them all but honestly didnt notice a big difference. I do primarily voice recording for podcasting and such so you may get more diversity when using musical instruments.<br /><br />Oh I almost forgot... the headphones are literally trash. Seriously, if you said you were just going to throw away the phones that came with it I wouldnt even trip. The pop filter is great though so you might as well get the package because the mic and pop filter together are going to cost you as much as this package. If you get a better deal minus the phones then.... do it.
