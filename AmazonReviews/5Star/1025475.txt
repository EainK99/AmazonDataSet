This is the second Danelectro &#34;Cool Cat&#34; pedal I've picked up, and both times I've felt like I stumbled across a secret weapon. A lot of Dano's stuff is cheap and trashy but these Cool Cat pedals have all the features of a much more expensive pedal - durable metal enclosure, true bypass, and good quality sounds.<br /><br />This Chorus is able to hit all the sounds I have tried for - if you want that warbly, overbearing 90s chorus it can absolutely do that, but it can also add a sparkly, smooth shimmer to a clean riff that's so subtle you hardly notice it's a chorus at all. I've used it for The Police style 80s sounds and 90s alternative clean strumming. I've also cranked it all the way to get a psychedelic, seasick Leslie type sound, not because I wanted that but just to see if it could.<br /><br />The only knock against the Cool Cat series is that they are kind of a strange shape - with the knobs and input/output on the top of the pedal and the curved sides, it can be challenging to fit into a pedal board with more conventional rectangular pedals. I tend to be &#34;set it and forget it&#34; with chorus so the odd knob positioning doesn't throw me off but if you had to change it in the middle of a gig it would be pretty difficult.<br /><br />Danelectro as a brand has a mixed reputation but these sturdy Cool Cat pedals are an outstanding value. This one probably doesn't sound as good as an expensive all-analog chorus but it sounds at least as good as any digital chorus twice its price, and since chorus is an effect many of us only use occasionally for flavor, this one offers more than enough.
