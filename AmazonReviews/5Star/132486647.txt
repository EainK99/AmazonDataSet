I love it! I I have it paired with my 66 fender bassman 2x12 cab and it sounds big. Great tone. I run my 64 duo sonic with single coils and it has awesome sustain. It really does make it sing. I have been playing off and on since the 80s and have not heard an amp that has a distortion as good as this one. Does do an alright clean tone but that's not really what this amp is for. I will be running an a/b box so I can switch back and forth from my bassman to the JR TT. I bought this amp for recording and have not laid any tracks yet and  it does have a bit of noise but that is to be expected with any high gain amp. Overall this thing really does rock. If you like a nasty sustaining distortion this amp is for you and it will not disappoint.
