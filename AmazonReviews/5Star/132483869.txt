I own this in [[ASIN:B00DS9A442 Azure Sparkle]], but fell totally in love with this black sparkle finish. This one looks beautiful under lights and the finish looks like a starry night in the southern latitudes.<br /><br />Looks, though are not only subjective, but not as important as sound and this kit is surprisingly big sounding for its size. It has a wider tuning range than I expected - you can tune it bebop high to a lower end thump.<br /><br />The toms and bass drum have a wonderful lower fundamental that is partly from the basswood from which the shells are made and partly from the roundover on the bearing edges. Ludwig uses 45 degree edges, but have rounded them to limit attack and provide a lower pitch sound. However, you can tune the bass and toms from bebop high to super low. I was surprised by the wide tuning range. More importantly the 13x13 floor tom is super easy to dial in. It's one of the few square drums I have come across that is not a chore to tune. By square I mean that the depth and diameter are the same.<br /><br />The snare drum is better than I expected from a drum kit priced at about what one would pay for a semi-pro snare drum along. Not horrible, not great. I tweaked mine with a few tricks and can live with it. I can provide instructions to anyone who is interested (my contact info is in my profile.)<br /><br />I do not use the included riser because it changes the relative geometry of your beater to bass drum head. Frankly I think risers are a waste of time anyway. Just attach your pedal directly to the hoop and use the riset for a paperweight. The center post tom mount is not only very functional, but it has a clamp opposite the tom mount that allows you to mount a ride cymbal directly off your bass drum. This eliminates a stand, lightening your load and reducing the footprint of the kit. I am using a [[ASIN:B0064RSPXM Tama Cymbal Holder 12 Inch]] that allows me to mount a 22\\" ride.<br /><br />I did not like the batter beads at all, but the music I play is best with heads that resonate. If you use moongel or other dampening techniques then you may find them to be adequate. For me the set came alive using Remo coated ambassadors on both the batter and resonant sides of the toms and the bass drum. Heads are a personal choice, so experiment.<br /><br />Overall this is a wonderful drum kit that is priced incredibly low. The size may put some folks off, but it sounds great and you can always mic them if you do not think you are high enough in the mix.the music I play is best with heads that resonate.
