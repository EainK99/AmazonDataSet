This microphone has the cleanest sound, nice everything from bottom end, mids, to the upper end with smooth and tamed sibilant sizzles! There is nothing bad that can be said about this mic! Through its 5 layers of different grade metal mesh, the plosives are very well controlled and better than the dull sounding Neumann KMS105. This is not as heavy as and my voice sounds cleaner and warmer than the Sennheiser e965 to my ears! Beyerdynamic is a family run business in Germany that hand crafts the best sound equipment in the world!! Many companies advertise and claim this and claim that! Beyerdynamic quietly is the clear winner in my last test I ran. I tested a Neumann KMS 104 and a Miktek PM9 to compare with the TG V96c and the TG V70d. Beyerdynamic microphones sounded cleaner  winning my sound test comparison after which I quickly shipped back the highly touted and hyped Neumann KMS 104 and Miktek PM9. Many companies claim their product is the standard! But...  Beyerdynamic has set a new world standard in sound!!!  I am not getting anything in return for this review but the best sound this microphone gives!! You should give this company a chance!  Cheers!!!
