Probably one of the best purchases I've ever made. The strings are definitely the finer quality, white Aquila strings. They sound amazing and hold tune very well after the first week or so. For such a small instrument, it has a very large, beautiful sound. The color is very nice and even, no chipping even with the many trips I have taken it on. The geared tuners hold very well and are easy to use. I could not be happier!!! PERFECT
