My husband and I bought this for our four-year-old grandson's birthday. He is positively in love with it. Playing with his new drums is the last thing he does before going to bed at night and the first thing he does when he gets up in the morning. The neighbors are not crazy about his 6 a.m. jam sessions though. He's actually learning how to play. I like that it is sturdy and professional-looking. I think it will last him a few years at least. My husband liked the price. For less than $100, we gave our grandson a gift that he can learn and grow with.<br />Although he doesn't know the difference between the snare and the bass yet, he's playing along with other drummers and matching simple beats.
