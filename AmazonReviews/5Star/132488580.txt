I was skeptical as the price was so low.  But after doing research and actually playing it, this is an amazing deal.  The Shadow tuner works exceptionally.  The tuners and strings are of more than adequate quality as well.  A little buzzing on the low e string on two frets, otherwise the action is superb.  This is a great guitar for players of all levels.
