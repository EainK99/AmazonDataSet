I purchased this unit for 200 and have been using it for about a year now.  I have no complaints.  The name of the game in recording is to get it into the box so you can start the magic mixing voodoo.  This interface gets you into the box cleanly and handles even my craziest 3 mic banjo setup or my ultra sensitive mandolin condenser mic.  Everything works without a multitude of extraneous crap.  Goesin 1800,  Goesout to the box. and two sets of monitors.
