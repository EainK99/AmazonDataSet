This case is sturdy and well made. It fits the Presonus perfectly. It has a dense foam bed and sides to cradle the board. But be prepared, this case is heavy and big. Standing on it's wheels it's a little over 3' tall and 2 1/2' long.<br />I would recommend this case to anyone who has to road their gear.
