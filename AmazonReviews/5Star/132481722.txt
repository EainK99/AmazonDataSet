I laugh when I see and read about how many of us judge equipment by the weight or the material its made of.<br />Think about it. How much does a plugin vst ..ect weigh? And yet a weightless plugin can run circles around hardware these days.<br />This preamp is light in weight but heavy in sound and performance while using my b1 condenser mic with very little noise..<br />An underated preamp for sure.
