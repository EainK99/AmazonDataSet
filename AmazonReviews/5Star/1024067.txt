This instrument is amazing; has great features for a bassoon that is under $5,000. Don't be fooled. Other big and hoity brands sell a PLASTIC version for the same price as this NATURAL MAPLE. Don't mind the brand snobs asking you what you own; they'll wish they had this bassoon when they hear it play. Only, it's yours and you don't have to let them near it.
