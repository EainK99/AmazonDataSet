These are well made and work as advertised.  The one thing you need to think about though is that all foot pedal input and output jacks do not naturally align.  This means that your pedals may look staggered on your pedal board do to the alignment of the jacks.  This doesn't effect the tone, it's just an aesthetic issue.
