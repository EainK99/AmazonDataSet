This bag was constructed to hold the truss that I had purchased. All of the components fit in the bag, along with cables and tools needed for assembly. The zippers extend to the base of the bag, which greatly helps in getting everything to fit. The only issue I have is that it is a VERY tight fit when putting in the vertical supports. I would appreciate a bit more room on the ends to be able to squeeze these in. Excellent construction in the bag and reinforcement in the handles. It does very well. Thank you!
