Bought it based on other reviews and really how far could you go wrong for this price.  Replacing a cheap US Selmer MP.  Here's what I really like, it has a middle or the road response.  That may sound like a negative but what it really means it that it is somewhere between my Berg Larsen metal MP and my Selmer S80 C*.  The Berg is bright and bold and the Selmer is smooth and creamy.  The Graftonite C7 can play edgy or smooth depending on how much you push it.  So if you knew you were going to play smooth jazz or classical you may choose the Selmer.  If you knew you were going to rock out you might pick the Berg but the Rico Graftonite can do both.  Throw in the price of $20 or so bucks vs. $150+ and it's pretty impressive.  Wish I had one of these in my school days but didn't know any better.
