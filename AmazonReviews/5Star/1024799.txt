I purchased this for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it! It sounds incredible, very bright clear notes/sounds. It has incredible bass response for such a small guitar, intonation is good, not perfect, but for being so small, it's good. It stays in tune very well, and the smaller frets take some getting use too.
