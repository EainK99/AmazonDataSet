I bought these speakers to do small backyard parties and they sound great. Especially for small venues. I actually bought two because i liked the first one i received. Note: the RCA connectors are cheap and break easy, but i opt to use the other connections anyway. They are smaller than i thought they would be but i still like them. For a few bucks more i think i would have went with the 15 inch instead. but they are self amplified and sound good. Easy plug and play. I also picked up the stands and they fit perfect..
