I like the weight and balance of these sticks. I favor 5A. The sound is every bit as good as wood sticks, and they last longer. Of course, the lifespan of any drumstick is strictly related to the player and/or music played. But you should try it for your self and you will see & hear that every WOOD stick sounds different from another. Even wood sticks with nylon tips sound different from each other. Maybe it's the wood type? Maybe it's the nylon tip type? But the difference is undeniable. Next time I go buy cymbals, I'll bring my favorite sticks. BTW - you'll only notice the difference of stick while playing the Cymbals, not the drums. Maybe this is also a good way to buy sticks?
