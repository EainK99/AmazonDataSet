good quality picks , and you won't be disappointed if this size of pick was exactly you were looking for because they are easy ti grab.<br /><br />I play jazz and I tell you with this picks you can really go fast.<br /><br />But don't dream about it. Without 4-6 hours of practice any pick is useless!!
