I have played clarinet for so many years and now I teach lessons at a public high school. My only issue with this instrument it the darn thumb rest. I ordered this cushion to remedy that problem and it certainly did. It is comfortable, small, and it does not affect my playing what so ever. I'm so glad I purchased this.
