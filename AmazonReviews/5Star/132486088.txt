My wife purchased this for my birthday, per my wish list.  We were amazed at the beauty of this little treasure.  Love the woodwork. Sounds great.  The case and tuner are of high quality.  Great beginner set.  I play it more than the mandolin she bought me as well.  I looked around at music stores and read many reviews.  I like the quality of the Oscar Schmidt/ Washburn brand.
