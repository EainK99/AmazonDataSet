I use this board in the studio and for live shows. In the studio. I use it as a tracking board in the studio. By using a combination of the 8 direct outs on channels 1-8 and then the four subs on 9-12 and the stereo main out on 13&14 and 2 aux. busses I can get 16 discrete channels to feed my converters and feed my Pro Tools rig. Using it for a small live show I can &#34; sniff&#34; the channels to feed a recording rig or a second board to use as a multi-mix monitor board. By patching in an EQ or two and an outboard FX  I can do some amazing things with this board. In addition to this board I use an older version when I need more channels. This board is very easy to work with. Almost intuitive. It's got a good feel to it. There are other boards out there that have more features and a lower price. I've tried some and wished that I hadn't spent the money on them. This is pricier than the ones made by the &#34;B&#34; company but more than worth the cost. You get what you pay for.
