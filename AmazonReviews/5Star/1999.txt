I recently got these headphones as a gift from my friend, so I decided to try them out. So far, I have been using this for a few weeks and I really like it! The sound quality is great, and it has tight bass with balanced mids and highs. The build quality is okay, but these dont cost a whole lot so I wouldn't worry about it too much. Overall, it's a great product for the money.
