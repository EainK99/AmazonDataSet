I bought the volca bass by mistake (I was actually looking for the volca sample for my project), but damn that thing was the best - excellent fat bass sounds, beautiful tweets, far easier to use and get started than the volca keys, far more responsive to just noodling around to get improvised bass-lines. The only thing I'd change about it is to have a midi-out as standard (there are mod-kits to add this) and have SD-card capabilities to expand the pattern memory options.
