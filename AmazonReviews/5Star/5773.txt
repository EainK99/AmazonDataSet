I have been using this power supply for over eighteen months with no issues whatsoever. I'll get the one thing you need to consider out of the way first: this is bulky and will take up an entire double electrical outlet. I use mine on a surge suppressor strip that has wall wart spacing, so that's not an issue for me.<br /><br />Mine works perfectly with a [[ASIN:B000OR9M80 Boss FBM-1 Fender '59 Bassman Pedal]], and has never over heated or failed in the year an a half I have owned it.<br /><br />The cable is not nearly as flimsy as other power supplies that I own and will hold up to heavy gigging as long as you properly care for and store the unit.<br /><br />I've also tested this on a variety of other pedals and tuners that require 9 Volts center-negative DC power and it words. Definitely recommended if you need a sturdy power supply (and the wall wart is not an issue for you.)
