The only bad thing about the Ultimate Drive is the graphic depiction of the Japanese Oni demon on the top of it. On the other hand, I am told that in Japan, if you are considered a total bada$$, you are referred to as &#34;oni-ni-kanabo,&#34; translating to &#34;Demon with an Iron Club.&#34; If you get this little monster, you will indeed be in possession of a demon with an iron club, with which you can slam the front end of any amp with enough juice to make it melt down like Fukushima. OK, enough Japanese (besides, this is a Chinese pedal).<br /><br />The construction is excellent, the switch is good and tight, and there are a LOT of possibilities hidden in the knobs. You can get everything from a slight boost to a wild, Jeff Beck era Yardbirds-like howl. There is plenty of power here and lots of tone.<br /><br />Let me put it to you straight. This is a professional level pedal. It is not junk. You can't classify it with the other inexpensive Chinese pedals out there, at all. This is an outstanding overdrive/distortion pedal, and the fact that it can be bought for this low price is nearly criminal. This little beast has muscled an American-made distortion/overdrive pedal off my pedal board.<br /><br />I won't name names, but you can find the story online. One of the so-called &#34;boutique&#34; pedal companies bought a ton of these, repainted and re-branded them, and sold them for FOUR TIMES what you are going to pay here. And people were coughing up the cash - until some insider revealed that this &#34;special boutique custom&#34; pedal was actually a Joyo Ultimate Drive with a paint job. It was a minor scandal.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this pedal without hesitation. It is as good as people say it is. I recommend that you use it with a tube amp, because that is where its qualities truly shine. It will turn your guitar into a demon-with-an-iron club. I suggest you get one now before Joyo pushes the price up.
