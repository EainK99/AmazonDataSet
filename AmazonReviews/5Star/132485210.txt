I give this five stars NOT because it is the best audio recorder.  It has some problems the biggest one is that it is made out of very thin and easy to break plastic.  This is not a rugged industrial tool.  It would be great if the body where milled from a solid block of stainless steel and if there were two XLR inputs.  But if it were then it would not sell for about $100 or fit in a pocket.  So, given what it is, it does it's job well the sound of the built in stereo pair of microphones is very good and the stereo image and even the \\"3D effect\\" sounds good.  It works for informal recording and if you are making a video and need audio quality a big two steps up from the camera's built-in microphone.  One other problem is handling noise.  this is NOT best if used hand held.  If you do hand hold it be very carefull not to move your fingers.  There are 1/4 inch threads on the bottom for a tripod or you can adapt it to a microphone stand<br /><br />But if you place this on some kind of stand and have a good environment, reasonably quiet you can make some good sounding recordings for a small price.<br /><br />For most people the weak link in audio quality will NOT be this unit.  It will be the reflections in the room and background noise.  To combat this and get the best quality turn the \\"automatic gain\\" off (use switch on the bottom) and then set the manual gain way down low and by sure to record in 24-bit mode and #1 above all else get the recorder as close as you can to the sound.  If using it like a microphone a few inches from yu fave you need a pop filter.  Do this and the sound is very good.  But if you hand hold this using automatic gain al you get is noise.<br /><br />It's well worth the $100 if you learn to use it correctly
