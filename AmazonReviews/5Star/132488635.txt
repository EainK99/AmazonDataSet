I built a 14x5 snare for concert/dry sound. I put Evans Strata 1000 heads on it, and added this 12 wire set. The sound that I get is nothing short of fabulous! I get a VERY articulate and crispy response out to the edge, with no mushy sound. Every stroke is clean and precise. There is enough snare sound without overpowering the drum. The concert series by Puresound may be the companies best kept secret! I think that the word \\"concert\\" scares away the average user. This would be ideal for anyone wanting to recapture a vintage sound, particularly with calfskin heads. The 16 strand set would work well for that also. Great sound and quality, at a very reasonable cost. Buy it!
