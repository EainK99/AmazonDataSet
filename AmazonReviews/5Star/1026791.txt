Let me start by saying I've been in retail sales my whole life until just recently, and I've always been a Klipsch / NAD guy! Through the years I've owned everything from Realistic to Mckintosh so I have a pretty good sense of whats good and what's not!As far as speakers go I've had everything from Fisher to KEF / B&W / Martin Logan / Klipsch / Polk Audio and the list goes on.For some reason out of everything I've owned and auditioned I always fall back on my NAD 7600, 2600A bridged mono and my Klipsch Forte 2's. About a week ago one of my amps started acting up so I took it in for service but they said they were really backed up and it could be awhile, in the meantime I saw this amp and thought I would give it a try. My expectations weren't very high for $350 and on top of that the specifications were like nothing I had ever seen in that price range.Anyway to sum it up BUY IT!!!!This amp is INSANE!!!!!!I hooked it up using a NAD 1600 preamp/tuner and 2 pair [4 total] of Pyle PADH215 2000W Heavy Duty Speakers in parallel, I'm not joking I swear I thought it was going to launch all 8 woofers across the room! The sound quality even at high volume was awesome, I'm still in AHHHHHH! I didn't want to make this a long winded review but I definitely wanted to get my point across, I was very leery of these new digital amps but if they all sound like this I'm all for it!!Great job Behringer keep up the good/great work!!<br />Jeff<br />I decided to see how far I could push the speakers,before the amp started to clip the voice coil on one of the pyle woofers ripped the spider cone and popped out of the magnet!! This is a first, in my entire career I have never witnessed anything like this! I knew the speakers had reached their limit but the amp still had more to give!!!So to sum this up RESPECT THIS AMP or you'll be replacing a lot of drivers!!This amp deserves 6 stars!!!
