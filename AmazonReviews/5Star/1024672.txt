We've used and sold these AT Turntables for over a decade.  Without a doubt, the best entry-level unit BY FAR.  Simple, stable, reliable, functional, consistent and serviceable.  It's everything a casual user could ever want, and not a bad one to have around when that $1000+ audiophile unit is in for repairs [again].
