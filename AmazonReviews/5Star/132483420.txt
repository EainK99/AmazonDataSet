I love the sound it gives. I hear every kind of music, from avicii to iron maiden and love the bass sounds in every song.<br /><br />The only thing is that they are a little bit too tight... The first days they were uncormfortable after an hour of using them... now I am more used to them and I tend to use them for longer periods without any problem.<br /><br />Really great quality-price ratio.
