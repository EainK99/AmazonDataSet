I needed a bag for light duty to carry my dreadnoughts around on occasion. This is my first Gator product and I was quite surprised at the level of quality for the price. Zippers work great and the padding is just thick enough to provide a snug fit for a standard dread acoustic. Exactly what I was hoping for. Nice full sized zippered pouch pocket that will be very handy as well. This is not a touring quality bag as far as top end protection goes, but perfect for short jaunts, nearby jam sessions and maybe a trip to the beach. I recommend it without hesitation.
