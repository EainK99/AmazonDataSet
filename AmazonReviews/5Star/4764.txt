These lessons are great. Each lesson covers all twelve keys while using different styles to learn scales.<br /> I find the accompanying music styles interesting and encourages me to learn the scales.<br />It is easy to follow but at the same time challenging and pushes me to learn.<br />I have had my saxophone for years and not put in the effort . When I decided to get serious and picked it up again, it was not long after that Mark came and introduce me to his lessons. It has helped me to progress and I do enjoy the lessons. I always look forward to the next lesson and what Mark will  introduce me to next.
