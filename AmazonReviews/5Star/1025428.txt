I'm old Amazon customer, and have been playing blues, R&B, soul and funk guitar for 60 years. I have owned and played everything. I have these pickups in my ES-339 semi hollow and my PRS Zach Myers SE semi hollow. I have used Gibson Classic 57s, Burstbuckers, Duncan Seth Lovers, Duncan Antiquities, and Duncan Alnico II Pros, etc. I cannot tell these from Duncan Alnico II Pros. They are clear, sweet, and articulate in the lows, mids and highs. I play clean through Fender blackface amps with alnico speakers. I have a PRS Studio with 57/08 pickups (the supposed holy grail of pups at $500 per pair), and actually prefer the Toneriders. The test for me is playing live, and, while all tone is subjective, the complexity and harmonics are the most important. These Toneriders have that in spades. Thanks.
