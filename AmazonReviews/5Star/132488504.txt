I was very happy with the value of this package.  I visited the guitar store the same day I ordered becasue I was not sure if I had gotten the best deal.  The store was running a sale on a similar Guitar (not a Yamaha), and the salesman let me know that the complete package would be about $205 &#34;out the door&#34;.  Well this was a lot less than $205 even with me paying for 1 day shipping!<br /><br />My son is a beginner, but his guitar teacher has this exact guitar.  That makes me feel pretty good about this purchase.
