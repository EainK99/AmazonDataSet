Unfortunately, the Stanton 680E.V3 seems to be gone for good. I bought a handful of these a few months ago when they were on sale at clearance prices and I've been very happy with them. The 680 may not be the best cartridge I have ever heard, but it does a fine, fine job: it handles highs very well with minimal distortion and delivers that \\"punchy\\" Stanton sound that gives my records a bit more of a \\"kick\\" than my Shure M97xE. (I really prefer the Stanton 680 over the Shure in most applications.) A robust low end and crisp middle range make this an excellent cartridge for almost any type of music. I'm glad I stocked up on a few -- I just hope I can continue to find styli for them.
