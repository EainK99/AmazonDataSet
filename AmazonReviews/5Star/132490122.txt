This is a very good product. Everything fits just as I expected. The unit is incredibly sturdy. The friction-fit covers on both sides have never given me problems. They are easy to remove and don't fall off otherwise. I'm a mobile karaoke jockey and this unit has been very good to me for about three years now. My only complaint is the weight. Again, very well-constructed, but this is made of heavy duty plywood. Unless you have two people to lift it, it can get tedious to transport in and out of gigs all the time. However, it looks great, hides all my wires, and keeps things neat, so I plan to continue using it because I like it that much. If you're looking for a unit that generally stays put, or will be carted around on wheels, this is an excellent choice. If you plan to move it around a lot and are looking for a light-weight rack, I'd try another product.<br /><br />Rack screws are not included.
