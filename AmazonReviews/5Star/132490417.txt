This was my second mic of this brand.  My first one I over-adjusted trying to get it fit around my ear comfortably and it snapped, so be careful and make really small adjustments if you need to.  My second one fits well and is very light and has better sound quality on my PA system than the mic my shure system came with.  It teach music and having a microphone is a lifesaver for my voice after teaching 8 elementary school classes and it's size makes it really easy for me to move around with the kids.  My students are also not as distracted by it because it is so small.
