Great little tuner. I found it to be accurate, as compared to a computer program I normally use for the purpose of tuning my baby Taylor guitar. It clips securely onto the head of the guitar and the battery has lasted a long time for me. Would highly recommend if you want a quick and accurate tune, especially on-the-go.
