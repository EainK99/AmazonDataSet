A lot of overdrive pedals claim to be \\"amp-like\\" in their response.  The Jetdrive is on a very short list of pedals that genuinely achieve it.  It's truly dynamic and more uncompressed than most overdrives, giving you the ability to control your tone just by your playing and control settings.  Soft playing is cleaner and a little spongier.  But the greatest thing is how much this pedal bites back in the high end when you lay into the strings--just like an amp would.  There are a couple things to be aware of: For one, it's not like a Timmy in that there is some tone coloration going on in both channels.  The blue channel in particular loses some low end and both channels have a bit more midrange than your natural tone (although far less midrange-y than a Tube Screamer).  It's not the pedal I'd use as a clean boost, but that's mostly because the overdrive is too good to be missed.  Secondly, while the blue channel is more \\"American\\" in its voicing than the green channel, I find this pedal to lean more toward the Vox/Marshall-y British sound in general.  Engaging both sides at the same time have given me a lot of boxy Queen-esque tones.  Finally, for being a \\"low gain\\" overdrive, this pedal will give you a ton of saturation. The overdrive is \\"chewier\\" than a lot of other pedals I've tried, and especially with the green side cranked, you can somehow get close to Hendrix Fuzz territory.  In general, this pedal is on the opposite end of the spectrum from a TS9, in my opinion.  While the tube screamer is smooth, midrange-y, and compressed, the Jetdrive is gritty, open, and astoundingly musical.  It's got the responsiveness of an OCD without the \\"hugeness\\" and crazy highs and uncontrollable lows.<br /><br />There are a few downsides to this pedal, not the least of which is cost.  The price is intimidating and disproportionate in comparison to most other drive pedals (even dual overdrives).  Next, while the pedal is incredibly versatile, it's very tough to balance the settings in such a way that you can use all three overdrive possibilities (green, blue, and stacked) in a single live setting.  Generally speaking, one side or both sides of the pedal have to be toned way down in order for there not to be a massive volume boost when you engage both sides simultaneously.  Also, the pedal is very \\"sensitive\\" (like an amp) and the sound can be altered entirely with very slight movements to the knobs (particularly volume).  That's not necessarily a bad quality, except for the fact that I find the knobs on this pedal much easier to bump than others.  This could just be my big dumb feet, but I'm really not a fan of the knobs on this pedal.  Finally, I've found the paint job on the Jetdrive to be a little weaker than others.  Even with lots of gigging, most of my pedals have stayed in very good condition, while the Jetter scratches very easily.  That's a trivial concern for me, however, and the housing and other components of the pedal seem very sturdy and high-quality.
