While technically a soft &#34;gig bag&#34; style case, this one has rigid enough walls to stand on its own. So it's really protecting your gear. Also nice is the hide - away backpack straps. Most of the time I'm not going far enough to need a backpack, but when I want 'em, there they are.<br /><br />I own a bunch of other Gator stuff and keep coming back. This replaced another gig bag I bought, for more than half the price, that didn't last me six months, and had no real company backing it available for complaints. You can't go wrong with this case.<br /><br />I mostly use this for my Rainsong BI-WS1000, which is my favorite for &#34;playing out&#34; these days. But it fits my Martin D-15 Dreadnought and pretty much every other acoustic I own.
