I picked up this pedal on Sweetwater for my home studio. And cuz I live in an apartment, I have a strictly headphone setup with electric V-drums and all. So I needed a guitar \\"amp\\" and considered getting the Line 6 Pod. I read lots of mixed reviews on the Pod. People usually said it was extraordinary or that it sounded fake. And since I've always had good luck with Boss pedals, I figured I couldn't go bad with the FBM-1.<br /><br />The guitarists I've had plug into the pedal all said they liked the clean tone it produced. When I listened to the playback of the recordings, you couldn't really tell that it's going direct. It truly sounds like a miked amp. I was very impressed and happy with my purchase.<br /><br />I mainly chose this pedal over the other Boss Fender-amp pedals cuz the FBM-1 has bass, mid, presence and treble controls which come in handy for electric bass. I'm not a guitarist so I wanted a pedal I could use, too. The BRIGHT input sounds superb.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great, low-budget solution to getting a nice tone.
