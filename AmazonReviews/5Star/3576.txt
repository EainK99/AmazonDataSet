Made it to me all the way from Kathmandu to the middle of nowhere in Virginia in three business days! No kidding! Easy to get to sing with the provided leather striker. Wood works as well but leather is better. Nice sonorous sound when struck with padded mallet. Depending on where it is struck, frequency of strike and overtones can vary a bit but it is a huge bowl - perhaps to be expected. Would be too heavy for some to hold for lengthy playing. Does well on a mat however. Resonates easily for 90 seconds
