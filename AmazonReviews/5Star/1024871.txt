I bought this tuner so I could have one in my pocket at all times. I generally love the SNARK, in all varieties, and have been very happy using them on lots of different kinds of string instruments. But on occasion I will pick up a guitar or banjo that belongs to someone else that doesn't have a tuner on it, so wanted something I could carry with my picks easily. I didn't expect such great performance, or features, in such a small package but the unit works great! It can detect the highest and the lowest notes on the guitar and banjo. I have not tried in on the hammer dulcimer, which demands a much wider frequency response, but so far I have been very happy with this unit. I carry it in a small drawstring bag with my finger picks in my pocket. If it continues to hold up being crammed in my pocket then it may replace my SNARKs, but for now it is a very convenient backup unit. The swivel head and reversible display make it very easy to see on every head stock I have tried so far.  Could see how on some head stocks it might be difficult to find a place to put it and see easily. On my banjo I attach it to the resonator ring, it is easy to see and I was surprised how well it works attached there.
