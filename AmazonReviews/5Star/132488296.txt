I use this simply to record commentary on top of videos and to chat on Skype. The sound quality is superb. Even with the levels very low my voice is crystal clear. Definitely worth the money if you want a good microphone with no static and clean audio. Although it should be noted you're going to want to adjust the levels on the mic based on your environment because it will pick up any sounds nearby when set at higher levels. Even at 30 my friends could hear my mouse clicking a foot away. You may want to consider some accessories to filter out the excess noise if this bothers you.
