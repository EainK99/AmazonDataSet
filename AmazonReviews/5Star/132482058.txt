I wanted a sound somewhere between a crash and a china.  This is it.  It's got the shimmering, glassy sound of a typical A Custom crash, and some of the darker tones of a china, but without the harsh \\"bark\\" when you strike it, and without getting trashy.<br /><br />It's not nearly as rude or as obtrusive as a typical china.  Pretty much the perfect middle ground.
