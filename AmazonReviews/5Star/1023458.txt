Microphone sounds amazing!  Only downside is that you would need to purchase a separate Phantom power module to help give it the strength you would want. It is just the right size for me to use for my stream and the sound is very clear.  It blew my mind to hear the difference from the headset I use to use compared to this sexy blue microphone.  I definitely would recommend this product! Just don't forget the phantom power module!
