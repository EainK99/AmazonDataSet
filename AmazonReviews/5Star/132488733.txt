My son recently the Guitar Pick maker and it works really well. He had a pile of old gift and credit cards and they make great picks. Picks are a problem in our house, my son is always leaving them around and they are always chewed. My the older picks just go in the recycling bin, tooth marks and all. Now if he can't find a pick he just makes one. His 9 year old sister makes them too, but she needs to step on the pick maker. It's holding up really well. Great product!
