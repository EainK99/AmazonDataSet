One of the best purchases I've made to date. I use it with Ableton Live and Keith McMillen's soft-step foot controller as a looping setup. The price is way low for what it provides. I like to plug this into my laptop and I use headphones so even when I'm jamming late at night my neighbors can't hear a thing. Also you can play for hours because it doesn't hurt the fingers like a regular guitar. The tapping mode is excellent too. So you can use it like a percussion instrument. I use it to fire off samples like an MPD which is great for beat making. Also, being able to have limitless instruments via a DAW and recording midi notes opens your guitar playing to a new realm of possibilities. I did have one small issue that got quickly resolved by YouRockGuitar's amazing customer support. So in short: the best midi guitar controller out there, best price, absolutely great customer support. This is THE midi controller for all guitarists.
