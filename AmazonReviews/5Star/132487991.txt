The Digeridoo arrived quickly and safely packaged in a extra large box.  Didgeridoo Store did an awesome job at this and I appreciate their level of customer service.  This was bought as a gift for a friend.  Only problem is trying to learn how to play it and breath at the same time without hyperventilating!  I guess that comes with practice though!
