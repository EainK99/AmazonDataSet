This was the first Ukulele I've ever bought. i play the bass and was looking for something with a lighter, more accoustic touch. If you are a beginner, and you know you want one of these fun little instruments, buy it. I think I would have bought this for twice the price. Luna is very reliable and i think this is just an A+ ukulele. 10/10 would play. it is so good in fact, that i will be playing it at a wedding.
