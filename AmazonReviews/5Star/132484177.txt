I bought a B-stock, spalted maple version of this bass. I'm really happy with the quality. It came set up very well, and I love the sound of the pickups - slapping, fingers and a pick all sound terrific. I'm excited about recording with this bass. Mine has the bass-mid-treble knobs and they're very useful, especially the mid, which surprised me. The tuners feel solid and the neck feels great. My bass weighs 10 lbs. Not too heavy and it resonates nicely. I work as a live and studio musician.
