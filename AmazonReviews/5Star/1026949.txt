Prior to purchasing the AT2020, I had used a couple of USB mics for podcasting, live internet radio shows and Skype calls.  Nothing wrong with either of the USB mics (a Blue Snowball and a Blue Yeti), in fact I highly recommend the Blue Yeti if you want great sound at a reasonable price with minimal fuss.  However, once I plugged my new AT2020 into my new (actually second new as I had to return the first due to faulty mic preamps) Behringer QX1202usb mixer, I quickly realized that I had taken a huge step up in sound quality.  Compared to the Yeti (still a great mic, mind you), the AT2020 sounds cleaner, warmer and quieter to these ears.  My internet show viewers immediately noted the improvement in the sound of my voice.  I always thought the Yeti sounded a wee bit \\"tinny\\" and the AT2020 confirmed my suspicions...and banished that problem forever.  Again, I still love the Yeti...but the AT2020 blows it away!  Gonna have to save up to get a better interface, 'cuz I'm not crazy about the QX1202usb mixer.  It'll have to do for now.
