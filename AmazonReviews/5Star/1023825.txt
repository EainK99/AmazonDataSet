So this is super cute and everyone who comes for a play date ends up on it somehow. It was a little big for her at 3 but now at 4'5 she's using it more efficiently. I got it just for fun so I can't speak to how it would be for lessons but it's good for young kids to start with an inexpensive instrument until they are ready to really develop their talents. Looks great up on the wall but it never makes it there. It's always out.
