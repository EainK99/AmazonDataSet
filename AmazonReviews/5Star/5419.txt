First off.. don't try to use the mouthpiece it came with.  Really.  Buy a Yamaha 4C for just over $30.  This is not optional.  Also, research reeds a bit.  For me, soft Rico reeds (2.5) make sense for now.  If you don't do these two things, don't blame the horn.  I'm not a kid.  I'm returning to saxophone after 40 years away.  Bought a Chinese made soprano first.  It was surprisingly good after a few adjustments.  So I bought an expensive professional Japanese soprano used.  The latter was better but not by nearly as much as you would expect.  I still play the Chinese soprano.  I stash it in the car when heading to a jam I'm not sure about.. I keep it set up to grab while watching TV without worrying about the cats knocking it over.  So that brings us to this horn.  I tend to play tenor and soprano so I wasn't looking to make even a moderate investment in an alto.  After my experience with soprano, I bought one of these.  I could always return it if it didn't work.  I works just fine.  Plays in tune.  Lower and upper registers are accessible.  Nothing busted.  The action is high.  The plastic bits are cheesy.  The finish doesn't match a nice horn.  But it's fine.  All those folks saying you can't make a saxophone for under some $ amount?  Either they are in denial or, more likely, their business is being impacted by the influx of disposable saxophones.  Of course longevity is a question.  If I find myself playing alto a lot I may get a better horn.  If it breaks in the near term, I'm out what I paid for it and will be disappointed.  However, I don't expect it to break.  I expect I will just enjoy it.
