I finally tracked one of these (full body, not cutaway) 2 months ago.  Am so pleased with the quality of construction and the resulting sound.  It holds tone so well, and the slightly more string distance separation really helps my clumsy playing.  I have a Martin DM, but this Seagull has been, and will be, getting far more playing time.  The cedar-mahogany combination solid wood has wonderful tone.  Thanks to our Canadian neighbors for producing such a quality musical instrument at a price more than worth it.
