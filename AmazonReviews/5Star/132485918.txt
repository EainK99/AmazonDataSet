I needed a good microphone for several purposes including gaming, skype and music. And I have to say that it does an amazing job at everything. Just plug it in the usb, and it works right away.<br /><br />The only downside of this mic in my opinion is the bright blue LED in front of it. It's too bright, kinda an overkill. So i just used some tape to cover it.<br />Also, in my opinion, the recordings with the mic are a bit too bright (when i record vocals for example), but I can always use some equalizer if needed.<br />Other than that, it's really a great microphone!
