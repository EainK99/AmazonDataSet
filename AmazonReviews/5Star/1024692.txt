This replaced a Fender American Vintage High Mass Bridge on a modified Fender Jazz MIM from 2013. The bass was suffering from an E string that sounded too &#34;boomy&#34;, and which also had a dead spot on the 5th fret of the E string. The Babicz bridge added overall sustain, and balanced the sound of the bass. The &#34;boomyness&#34; went away and the sustain on the 5th fret increased from 5 to 9 seconds. I was considering selling the bass, but after installing the Babicz bridge this bass is staying with me forever.
