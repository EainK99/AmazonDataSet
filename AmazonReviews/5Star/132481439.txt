This pick went way, way, beyond my expectations.  Makes my bass sound super sick! Gives it a tight tone while still maintaining a great bass thickness to it. And they lool even cooler than the picture. Definitely recommend! I don't even like playing with picks, but since I got these picks, I found some songs that just go perfect with what sound the picks produce on bass. LOVE THESE PICKS! And GREAT SELLER TO FAST SHIP!
