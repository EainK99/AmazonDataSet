I bought this from Amazon/Austin Bazaar and called Austin with some pre sales questions before placing the order. They were extremely pleasant and helpful. Yes this is a newer + version and you can not upgrade the older version. Thus why they came out with a new one. So I would disregard any negative reviews about the old one not being able to be updated. It was on the market for how long before this one came out. You can still buy the non + one for $100 less. So are those 50 new sounds worth the extra money? I think so and do not regret my purchase at all. Just buy it you will love it too.
