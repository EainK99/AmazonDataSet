I have a Bugera V22 Head (I know, Uli Behringer's The Devil - whatever). I've had it for about 3 months. I've been playing for 15 years or so. This is my first &#34;all-tube&#34; amplifier. It sounded better than anything else I've had so far, but I believed with a new set of tubes it could sound better still. I did a little reading and put together a custom set to suit my needs - home studio & practice space (no playing out with this). I does indeed sound great. Regarding this particular tube though (1 of 5) it didn't really make much difference. It doesn't sound any worse. It's just that while replacing the other 4 tubes made a huge impact, this one sounded the same as what was already there. And yes, I replaced it before the others. It is a totally quality product, but apparently so is what was in there. Now I have a back-up. Win-Win. BTW, the phase inverter that was in it is a Bugera 12AX7B (like a whole bunch of other new-production tubes, it's a re-branded Shuguang from China). Maybe buy this one instead as the Chinese get enough of you business.
