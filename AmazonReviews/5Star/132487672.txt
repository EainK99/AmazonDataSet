i bought this guitar to play at work on the oil fields on the north coast of Alaska.<br /><br />upon receiving this guitar there are two modifications i made.<br /><br />1. remove the middle pickup, i only ever use the bridge pickup and i kept hitting the middle one with my pick.<br />2. remove the volume knob, i kept bumping it when palm muting and it would eventually go silent in the middle of a sweet riff, kind of a ball breaker.<br /><br />the action on this guitar is amazing, the only faster guitar i have played was a high dollar schecter. there are no buzzes, it is a little bit high towards the top but i never found it to be limiting. i have an ibanez, a strat and a custom esp and this is my go-to guitar every time. i will be buying steinberger products from now on......after i make that schecter mine ;-)<br /><br />on the tremolo, i never use it, leave it locked and you will have to tune every 2 weeks if you play every day, its solid.<br /><br />shes got a good crunch through the humbucker, i play metal/hardrock and i couldn't be any more pleased. make sure you get some extra double ball strings.<br /><br />i would buy this guitar if it was 1200 bucks.<br /><br />worth every penny.
