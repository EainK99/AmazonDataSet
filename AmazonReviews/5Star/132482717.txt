You can't go wrong with Humes & Berg ....they have making cases for as long as I can remember ....the Galaxy line is great for the casual player very durable.  Explorers Percussion is probably one of the best merchants in the business ...a great line of equipment .  Humes & Berg Galaxy bags are the best value.
