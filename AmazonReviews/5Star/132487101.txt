Purchased this headset for use in 80+ year old church in a large city, near radio station broadcasts, and a university. The flexibility that this system provides to automatically scan multiple channels to find a frequency for your space is invaluable. Sennheiser has rich quality sound, has been very reliable and durable thus far, and is easy to use. It is pricey, but I'd buy again. It's worth it - high quality product.
