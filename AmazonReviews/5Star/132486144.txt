Great strap, killer price. The design is more subtle than the pictures indicate (I'm not into going overboard with the whole skull and bones motif so, that's ok with me). I bought it for my black strat.  However, I am currently using it on my ebony Les Paul and I am surprised at how comfortable it is (it's only 2.5\\" wide and I use 3.5\\" or wider on all my LPs ('cause they are heavy)).  I must have 5 or 6 Levy's straps and I am pleased with all of them.
