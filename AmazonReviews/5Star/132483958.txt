The Nano Vypyr is a perfect little travel amplifier. I got this amp for the camping season because of the battery feature. While I am a fan of many other Peavey products, this was the only one that would really suit my needs. The price was good so I thought I would give it a try. It has all the features and effects I would want in a small practice amp. The tone and quality is pretty good for the price as well.<br /><br />If you're looking for something small and portable while still producing good sound quality, I'd totally recommend this amp.
