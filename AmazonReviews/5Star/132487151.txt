I produce, and the 49 keys provides just enough room to get the job done. If you are familiar with other M-Audio keys, these are about the same as those on the Keystation 66/88 keyboard. The keys are comfortable and feel decent (though I'm not much of a piano player, a real player may find the keys horrible). The controls are positioned nicely and the overall look is sharp. The keyboard fits nicely on a two tier stand. If I had a single complaint (this is very minor) the pads take a bit to get worn in. I'm still not certain if its the pads or if I just got used to them (certainly debatable).<br /><br />Configuration is a breeze. As advertised, as soon as the software identifies the Axiom Air it is configured automagically. I've not run into a single problem with mine. I use it in Ignite, Cubase, Reason, and several other DAW/software titles.<br /><br />The Ignite software is great. It's exactly as stated in the advertisements (intended to get ideas down quickly). I'd like it even better if the continued to offer new instruments packs (maybe they do or will).<br /><br />Overall, if you are a producer or musician looking to add some new features to your kit. This is a great addition. I use it for movie scores, electronic, rock, metal, orchestra, experimental. It's a great addition to the home studio and adds a significant amount of capability to your musical toolbox when paired with the latest software.
