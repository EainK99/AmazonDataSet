Before buying this guitar, I was actively shopping for an acoustic within the $200 to $600 price range.  Something of a wide range, but I wanted to keep my options open. Of course, hoping to find that little gem whose value far exceeded it's cost.<br /><br />So I looked at and played the Fenders, the Seagulls, Martins, Taylors, Ovations, Gibsons, etc. And narrowed it down to either getting a Taylor, Seagull or Ovation. Up until I ordered, I did not really considered the Takamine.  Although, I did know they had been a quality product for years.<br /><br />Then, it came down to value.  To get the Taylor or Seagull with that I wanted would have put me above my price range.  Then it was down to an Ovation and I found an Ovation Celebrity for around $160, so I thought I was set.  Then, I saw this guitar with a violin like design made by Takamine, the eg444c-vv, that was marked down.  Why or for how long it would be at that price, I did not know. The brand was known to be very decent. The reviews were good but very few. Then there was the question of whether it was a maple top, back and sides or mahogany.  One part of the description said maple the other mahogany.  Then there was the question of where it was made, even the Japanese companies have gotten wise to the value, or \\"horrors\\" in some cases, of outsourcing.  I say \\"horrors\\", because it seems that you never know what you're gonna get. At this point, Ovation was in the same boat in that almost all of its production was being handle in Asia.<br /><br />I was very close to pulling the trigger on the Ovation Celebrity, but that violin finish kept calling my name. The gambler in me also wanted to see if I would get the deep mahogany tones or the mediocre maple?  Would I get the Korean or China made? Would the few people who reviewed the guitar be mostly telling the truth? There was also a rumor of the guitars being \\"blems\\", or blemished products. I decided to go for it and ordered the Takamine.<br /><br />Well, the gamble paid off! The mahogany is gorgeous and definitely contributes to the \\"resonance\\", describe in one of the other reviewers comments. Although known for coming in late to the high end guitar manufacturing market, China has definitely upped their game.  They can make pretty incredible sounding guitars now, but they can also make pretty terrible guitars. In this case, we have the former...the guitar sounds great.  The reviews did not lie about the tonal qualities of the guitar. The guitar has tonal character while still having a good amount of volume. As for quality of construction, it could nit pick about a few things but not at this price. This guitar was fantastic buy.<br /><br />There are other things to note. The tuners are decent and the guitar stays in tune a fairly long time after the strings get broke-in.  The amplifier electronic are actually very good and comes with a tuner and a 3 band equalizer. Did I mention the warm tone the a mahogany body produces? Also, the eg444c-vv perfectly fits inside the Takamine GC1128G G-Series Dreadnought/NEX Guitar Case.<br /><br />Cheers!
