This is an extremely well built product.  I can't say anything is indestructible, but this clearly is meant to last.  Has phenomenal resonance, and bass, so it just sounds amazing when played.  I do recommend getting a floor stand for it, however, as it is a little uncomfortable to try to hold one this size at an angle to allow sound and resonance out the bottom.
