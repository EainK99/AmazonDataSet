This thing is great. I bought it for an amateur podcast I do. I wanted it to not sound amateur, and this thing helped immensely. The device allows you to record phone interviews with guests so that it sounds like you're in a real studio instead of the scratchy sound of two people talking on phones.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
