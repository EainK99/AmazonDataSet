I bought this guitar at GuitarCenter. It sounded better than all the guitars in it's price range and the craftsmanship is excellent. These guitars are greatly UNDERPRICED for the quality you receive....that is because the top of the guitar is made from cosmetically &#34;unattractive&#34; wood, but it's tonally excellent. A slick paint job covers the defect! Seagull passes the savings on to you, and these are excellent guitars.
