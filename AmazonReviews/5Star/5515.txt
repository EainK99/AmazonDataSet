This stand shows your guitar with it stylish look, protects it with the little rubber lock thingy over the neck part, it is safe and strong. I am very happy with the transaction. The stand worths the money and the shipping is super fast. Even if you travel with your guitar, just fold the stand and take it with you (it is not that heavy) and leave your guitar on the stand when you take a break.
