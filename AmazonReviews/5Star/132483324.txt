The isn't the first ocarina that my daughter has, as a matter of fact she has a small collection of them.  This one she said has great high notes with out a lot of air sound.  It looks stunning and has a very warm and rich sounding low note range.  She ties this ones sound to one of her other ones that is top in class but adds on bonus for the look and the chain it came with.  She has also said this will be going with her to the TX RenFest where she will be playing it.
