I bought this clarinet for my 4th grader who was in Beginning Band at that time...It has been two years and he still loves this clarinet.  He is now in Middle School and we have not had any problems with this clarinet at all.  I offered to upgrade him to a Yamaha Student Clarinet recently, but he even refused!!!  He says he really loves his clarinet and will keep playing it for as long as it will play...So far, so good...I'm really glad I got this for him when I did!!!  A really great buy...
