There are 6 ways to wire it, so take your time testing which way is correct before you solder it in. I replaced the input jack on my Warwick Streamer Stage 2 and it is working perfectly. Was easier to install and tighten into the hole than the old Switchcraft jack I used to have installed. Took me about 20 minutes to complete the job.
