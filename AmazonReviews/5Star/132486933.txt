Bought this for an old tenor guitar (not banjo!), as it's virtually impossible to find separate parts for tenor guitars online or in person. While a bit thin, as it should be at least twice as thick, it works out well enough. Just took a file to make deeper string grooves. Perfect height, too. The tenor guitar now plays beautifully!<br /><br />While not exactly what I wanted, it works out just fine. So +5
