A fantastic midi keyboard for the price. I use Windows 7, Ableton 9 Lite. After the unit was plugged in, the drivers downloaded automatically: took about 5 minutes. Opened Ableton, selected Midi input, selected an instrument and it played! No drama, Ableton recognized the controller automatically. The keyboard is compact, 18&#34; X 5&#34;, the keys are a decent size and the controls work well. It's a basic midi controller, no bells and whistles. If you are looking for a simple, easy to use midi keyboard then you can't go wrong with the AKM320.
