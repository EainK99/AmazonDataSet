I like the RTOM MoonGel product because it makes practice of drumming exercises much harder and builds the muscles of the hands. This is because the MoonGel has no bounce to it like a rubber pad or snare drum head would provide, and it forces the hands to work for every part of the stroke. Using it has greatly improved my double-stroke roll, paradiddles, and single stroke rolls too. Worth the investment!
