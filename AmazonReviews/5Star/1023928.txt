It's not a permanent fixture, and you shouldn't keep picks in the pickholder like it suggests because you WILL knock it with your hand and picks will go flying, but it does keep your guitar in place.<br /><br />I keep it nearby and just flop it on the corner when I'm tracking guitar.  I like that I can move it very easily when I don't need it.  If you need something more permanent get the more expensive one, but this is a great product.
