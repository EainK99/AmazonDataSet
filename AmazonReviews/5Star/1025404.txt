This mute was affordable and shipped quickly. I find that the mute softens the violin enough so that it isn't annoying but not so much that I can't hear the music I'm creating. This is a must have for practicing without disturbing others, whether they be the people in your home/apt. or neighbors. If you have never heard a violin played in-person, they are LOUD.
