At the moment I own about 10 pair of headphones 3 of which are considered PREMIUM, whatever that means. As long as I was listening to digital sources exclusively, the selection among the top 3 headphones was a matter of taste. More bass? Choose brand A. Mid range definition? Choose brand B etc.. But ever since I converted my source material and amplification to include ANALOGUE these are clearly the best sounding and most enjoyable of the lot. They are without doubt the most &#34;natural&#34;, and the least Intrusive.<br />The paradox with really good audio is that the better it is, the harder it is to describe, - because the anomalous characteristics which lend themselves to description seem to disappear. [Many years ago a brilliant loudspeaker designer, G.A. Briggs, demonstrated that you can make an &#34;uncolored&#34; speaker sound like any &#34;anomalous&#34; speaker by playing a recording of the latter through the former. But there is no way to play a recording of the &#34;uncolored&#34; speaker through the &#34;anomalous&#34; speaker to make it sound &#34;uncolored&#34;. Pretty clever, eh?]<br />In the case of these AKGs you seem to be hearing the amp, the tubes, the phono cartridge, but not the headphones. I know a couple of young guys with great ears that I count upon to validate the verdict of my aging ears. It is worth mentioning that their conclusions matched my own.<br />I must admit to never having heard the really, really expensive multi-thousand dollar headphones, which might well be superior, but in this price range I have heard many of them and this is by far the best. It is my favorite sound, in a very comfortable package. To me that is an unbeatable combination which I can recommend unreservedly
