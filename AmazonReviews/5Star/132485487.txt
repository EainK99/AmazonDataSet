So i bought this guitar a while ago but I COMPLETELY forgot to write a review. It is wonderful even though I am only a beginner. I don't really think there is a such thing as the perfect 'beginner's guitar'. It really depends on each person and what's comfortable for them. But I really loved it. it comes with everything that you absolutely need. It is acoustic electric so if you plan on plugging it in and jamming and stuff you should also buy an amp but i'm fine either way.<br />Pros:<br />everything. the finish is wonderful. it comes with more than enough picks. the stand is easy to use. the strap feels comfortable and the bag is a lot better than it looks. the guitar itself is AMAZING<br /><br />Cons:<br />how can i ever say anything bad about this? though i would say it took a while to get to my house, it was well worth the wait.<br />one thing, i just wished it came with a capo but finding a good cheap one on amazon isn't hard.
