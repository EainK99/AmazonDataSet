DO NOT USE GLUE. The glue got into my LED strip and blue the rest of the strand. Unfortunately, I installed the lights with the strand off, not wanting to blow my car battery. They where completely installed after I realized it broke. Anyways, half the strand broke, but the other half worked and they honestly look so sick in my car. Maybe a little expensive for what comes with it but if you're a teen like me... They are completly worth the grand total of $30.55. Buy these lights but don't use glue or get water near them.
