This recorder works as intended and as easy as can be. Its' simple and coherent instructions guide you through the initial process perfectly. All of the features work great for the way I'm recording and mixing. I just export my recorded drum tracks to the computer and upload into Sonar and add effects, change levels (basic mix). A good way that works for me is to get a decent mix and import a stereo mix back into the Tascam and use that to add guitars, vocals, etc. Then simply export the added tracks back into the drum mix and build from there. You can get a seemingly endless amount of tracks for the final mix on the computer. This is an excellent way to do some home recording. Oh, and the price was better than anywhere on the internet (at the time and maybe even now) and shipping was quick. 5 stars!
