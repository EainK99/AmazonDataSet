so you NEED a good sound card or DAC to power these, i chose the Asus Xonar Essence STX and my oh my they are good together. the bass is powerful while the mids and highs are clear and distinct. the thing is that as powerful as they are you can easily make the neighbors complain. so make sure you play the most atrocious music for you neighbors to complain about. i recommend Industrial or Agrotech or Noise. then they really will complain... seriously they are power full so watch out for that.
