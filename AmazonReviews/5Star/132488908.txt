Great product at a good price. Very solid stand. Looks great & functions perfectly. I did need to grind down the mounting plate edges at each corner in order to fit my Dell monitor, but I have an older (smaller) Sony that the mounting fit into perfectly. The fit was so close that it wasn't worth measuring, so I ground it down. Very pleased with the product.
