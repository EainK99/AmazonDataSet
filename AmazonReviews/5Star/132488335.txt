At first the mid to high range sounds were far clearer than the bass, but the bass improves after breaking them in.  Overall, the clarity is great, and these headphones do a great job blocking out background noise.  I've used them to play songs on drums along with the recorded version of the song, which requires a lot of background noise cancellation.  If you're on a budget, these are the headphones to buy.  If you aren't, they'd make a great backup pair.
