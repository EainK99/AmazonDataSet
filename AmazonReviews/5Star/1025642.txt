Guitar fits well enough to hold it securely, since my Takemine replica of an 1850's Bruno Parlor Guitar is an odd size.  But all my careful measuring, and hours of comparison shopping paid off.  It does not slide around at all, very secure fit.  Many compliments on the sturdiness, materials, and design from other musicians.  The materials and workmanship are holding up well; still looks brand new after 5 months of hard use, in and out of my pick-up truck, with all my other equipment.  Rides like a dream.
