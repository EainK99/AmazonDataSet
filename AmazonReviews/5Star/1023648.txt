I am very pleased with this purchase! It works very well. I love that I can plug it into an outlet or use it with batteries. The led lights are very bright too. I like that you can bend them to where you need them to be. It's small and compact so they fit in my purse easily. That's nice because I can travel with it. It clips into the music stand securely and doesn't shift or fall or get in the way of turning pages. It also works quite well as a book light, lighting both pages at the same time! Great gadget!
