I needed to practice my music for choir and I barely read music, and don't play piano. This keyboard is just right. It does not take up much space in my tiny little house. It is ready to play. I was able to plunk out what I need to sing as soon as I plugged it in. I found a couple of piano lesson books that I had  (updated) when I was in the third grade. I think my little grand-babies will love this, learning to play the piano with Grammy.
