This pop filter is very easy to set up to your mic stand. How I have my set up is a bit of a mess, but this pop filter pulled through without complications and the quality is much better than my last pop filter. As everyone else has been saying, it does its job in eliminating pop sounds and reducing noise from breathing greatly. This is the pop filter I would recommend to anyone looking for a good pop filter at a fair price.
