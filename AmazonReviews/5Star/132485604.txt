After my old Shure buds bit the dust (the cord cracked and there was exposed wire), I tried buying 2 different buds.  The Klipsch and Beats.  Neither came close in highs and lows.  The noise isolation is great, which is important to me.  I want to hear the music, not background noise.  I highly recommend Shure buds!
