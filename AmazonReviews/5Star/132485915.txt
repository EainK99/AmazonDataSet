This light is great for large area coverage and definitely isn't just a spotlight, it covers a great amount of area. I had read previous reviews on this blacklight and I was kind of scared to order it because I thought the light would break in shipping. I opened the package and took the giant bulb out and it was rattling but I put it in and it still worked. It needs about a 5-10 min warmup for maximum potential, and when cutting off, DO NOT turn back on immediately, as it will shorten the bulb life and possibly burn it out. Wait a good 5-10 min before cutting it back on.
