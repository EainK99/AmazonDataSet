This headphone amp is a real workhorse.  It's affordable and having used it for the past two years- it's still alive and kicking!  More headroom than you'll ever need.  If you aren't careful with this thing you can blow your ears out.  This is such an essential piece of equipment for me.<br /><br />I use the Presonus Studiolive 16.4.2 mixing console.  It had 6 Auxiliary outputs for personal monitor mixes.  Those mixes are used for in-ears - not wedges - so when you would go out of the auxiliary output with headphones you would only hear one side.  It'd drive you nuts.  By using the auxiliary inputs as well as the outputs in the back of the headamp 6 I'm able to get the mono signal out of the board to go to each ear in the headphones.  It's not true stereo but it seems like it.  Highly recommend this if you want to get creative for in-ears and not buy a lot of additional expensive equipment.
