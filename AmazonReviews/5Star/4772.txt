I've been drumming for nearly 40 years (ouch!) and have used a lot of different drum thrones over time including the original Roc-N-Soc spindle model that I used for about 12 years. I have found my new happy place with the Roc-N-Soc Lunar Series throne. I read a few reviews that whine about slipping due to the smooth feet. Not a problem for me, but even if it were a serious problem it's an easy fit to add velcro or rubber pads.<br /><br />I bought this throne after sitting on Tama, DW, PDP, Ludwig, Gibraltar and many others at the local Guitar Center. No other throne offered me the stable, comfortable feeling that this model does. When you sit down and settle in, you don't feel any tipping or the need to re-center yourself repeatedly. Add the back support as I did and I think you'll get many years of satisfied service. I ended up purchasing at GC because the manager agreed to a bundle price for the seat and back support. Regardless, this is a good piece and a fair price for what you get.
