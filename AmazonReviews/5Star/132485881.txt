Wonderful action, slightly bright but pleasant tone compared to my A-style.  If you want a solid wood \\"F\\" style mandolin at a reasonable price, you can't beat this!  A little bit of residual polishing dust in the scroll that mostly cleaned up with a little guitar polish/wax.  Is it worth it?  Without  doubt!  Would I get another now that I have seen it and played it. Absolutely!
