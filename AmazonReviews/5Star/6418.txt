I have used a variety of violin tuners over the years. This clip-on tuner is great for tuning in a noisy area. It will read your string's note either by sound or by vibration. I thought at first that the red color would be a bit too wild. However, it is a lovely tone that blends in well with the brown color of my violin's scroll where I have it clipped. I do not even notice it's presence (by sight or by getting in my way) when I am playing the violin. Very cool tool!<br /><br />The price was very moderate for the technology this provides.
