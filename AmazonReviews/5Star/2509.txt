These are fantastic and look amazing...the perfect shade of red with a nice subtle shine.  At first I was pissed off because I thought the short straight cable was broken, but then I realized I wasn't screwing it in far enough...you need to screw it up past the &#34;pop&#34; noise that tells you the plug has clicked in, and then to screw it up just a tad more until it seats firmly.  I wasn't screwing it in all the way because it felt like I was going to strip it if I went any further, but I finally just cranked it in there, and it worked. It's cool they used the screw thread feature to either use the adapter or seat the plug firmly into the headphones.<br /><br />The sound is incredible for the price.  I wish they would make this same design in a chrome green!
