This is a great bag! The construction of the bag is sturdy and supports the neck beautifully, and the surrounding padding is firm, yet light weight, protecting the guitars on all sides. I purchased this bag to replace a cheaper, more well known brand, sold by one of the big retailers, and it is proof of a time worn saying, &#34;You get what you pay for&#34;!!!  I say, &#34;Money well spent!!!<br /><br />B-edgy  www.u2lavation.com  Facebook: L.A.vation
