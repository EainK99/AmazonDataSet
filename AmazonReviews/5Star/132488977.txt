Possibly the best for the price.  You can't get better medium sized room monitors.  The bass response is good enough for hip-hop production but will not register certain super deep frequencies.  That being said, there are very few songs that have a lot of the groove below 43hz.  Trust me, you won't need a sub with these speakers unless you are producing orchestrations or are in a larger room!  Very clean and  are amazing for referencing.  You can hear all the litttle details and really tell the difference between a good mix and a bad one.  Enjoy these bad boys!
