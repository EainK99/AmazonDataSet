Not only does it look very classy and professional, but the unit works fantastic. Definitely heck of a lot better than my Sennheisers. The treble and bass is very nice and tight. I tried it on the Home Theater system and it works great. I tried it on the Nexus 7 tablet and it seems to cut off signal to the right channel every now and then. Don't know if this is a driver issue, loose cable or what with the tablet or headphone, but didn't have any issues with it on the HT system over a period of time. Will have to monitor for sometime and see if there really is an issue or not.
