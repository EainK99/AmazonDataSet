An excellent stomp pedal producing a warm and lush tremolo.  I leave the depth at 9-10 o'clock and that way the effect is kept quite subtle.  At 5 o'clock it is pretty much square chops, making the pedal quite versatile.  I bought the Tremor for a CCR project and it seems ideal, with the bonus option of selecting two speeds.  The pulsating Led is another plus.  Oh, and when I opened the box I was reminded about the remarks about the funny smell.  It does stink, but now that it's been out of the box for a few days, the smell seems to be receding...  It does look cool and retro, though.
