I'm just a beginner to playing guitar but this package seems to be a great place to start. The electronic tuner made it a breeze to tune the guitar and the DVD from Yamaha had me playing chords in no time. I've been practicing with it every day for a month and so far no problems with keeping it in tune and it does have a nice pleasing sound to it.
