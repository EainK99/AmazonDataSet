I thought that by buying this beginner's ukulele, I would have to buy another eventually, thinking it was cheap and not &#34;real.&#34; But as soon as I got it, I found it was the most awesomeist ukulele ever. It's small and comfy and cute and VERY good quality. This beginning ukulele is worth its price ^^
