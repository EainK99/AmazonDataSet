Starting a voice recording business on a shoestring budget made me take a look at this package. It appeared to have everything I needed to get started and the price was quite reasonable. When the package arrived, of course, I took out the contents and connected everything right away. It was all easy to do. There is an instruction manual on the DVD that comes with the package. I give that instruction manual a C-. It tells what things are, but it doesn't explain how to use the equipment. Whoever wrote the manual assumed people who would read the manual would be familiar with the process. It just didn't instruct to the level I needed. Ultimately, through trial and error and online forums I was able to get it all figured out and once I did that, I began recording. I must say that I am very happy with my recording system. It worked out well. I rated this product high because (aside from the faux manual) I have been very successful recording, editing, and producing audio projects. The package had everything I needed to begin recording from day one of setting it up.
