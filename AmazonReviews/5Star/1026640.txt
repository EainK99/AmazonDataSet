I've been using this Blue Yeti for about a month now for all my microphone needs on my computer. Works great for my &#34;soft phone&#34; application for my toll-free number, Google Hangouts, Skype, and any other audio input. I still tend to get a bit of echo from speaker feedback even on the forward facing cardioid setting so I just plug a set of earbuds into the bottom of the yeti and I'm good to go.
