I have relied on SquareTrade warranties for many years now, and on those occasions when my items have failed for whatever reason, Square Trade has always repaired or replaced my items promptly with no hassle and good communications.  Square Trade warranty plans are also substantially less expensive than those offered by stores and online merchants. I plan to always use Square Trade for my future warranty needs, and you should too.
