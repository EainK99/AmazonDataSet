I expected a cute little gift for one of my guy friends that always says he needs things colorful. Believe it or not he is in love with it and several people have asked where he got it from. It sits in one of his lamps 24/7 and. It even works with his weird touch lamps that go at three different speeds. This little bulb is a trooper and we havnt had any problems when we have owned it for 6 months.
