From the first time I heard a Bass Big Muff, I knew that was the fuzz sound I wanted, but the regular size pedal is a little large to fit onto my bass pedal board. Luckily, EHX is apparently aware of their pedals' huge footprints and has been slowly but steadily releasing these &#34;nano&#34; versions of their most popular effects. (If only the nano-sized Micro POG had existed a year ago.) This nano version is wonderfully small, not quite as little as an MXR but definitely smaller than a standard Boss-sized pedal.<br /><br />The simple, three-knob interface is easy to use. With the &#34;sustain&#34; (fuzz amount) up at about ten o'clock, it adds a nice grit to your playing, and cranked up to two o'clock or higher you get a thick, woolly fuzz. The best feature of the Bass Big Muff is the ability to dial in some of your unaffected sound in parallel with the fuzz, which (to me) is mandatory, especially at the higher levels of gain. With this sort of parallel signal, you can have massive beastly fuzz going and still clearly hear each note you're playing instead of just creating a wall of noise.<br /><br />This is a great, easy to use fuzz pedal. I wouldn't call it versatile, exactly, but the couple of things that it does, it does super well. I definitely appreciate the nano size.
