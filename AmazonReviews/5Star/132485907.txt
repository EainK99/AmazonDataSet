I just ordered my second one of these Gibraltar rack sides. I have four Pintech 10\\" toms, two cymbal arms, an Alesis Sample pad and an Alesis Control pad mounted to this arm and it's rock steady. This really cleaned up the drum area, eliminated several stands and placed all the instruments at the exact correct position we want them. This additional arm will support my no-leg hi hat so there's more room for the double bass drum pedals.<br /><br />Don't be suckered into buying any of that \\"Sound Percussion\\" hardware Guitar Center sells, it's not even close in quality, Gibraltar has years of experience, the fit, finish and function are all superior on the Gibraltar product. The guy at Guitar Center told me he could order me Gibraltar hardware and have it in three to five days, I pulled out my iPhone and showed him Amazon would deliver most of what I was looking for in TWO DAYS and right to my front door.<br /><br />The best part is Amazon pricing and availability of Gibraltar, it's the best. Everyone who sees my drum kit is blown away by how many things I have for the drummer to beat, kick, stomp and whack, Gibraltar hardware made my drum set INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon and Gibraltar.<br /><br />Good luck and good music to all.
