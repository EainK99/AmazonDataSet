I am a drummer.  I bought these for a small home studio I am putting together.  I  went to an arts and crafts store and bought 48&#34;×36&#34; smooth cardboard display boards. ( perfect size ) and  a bunch of t pins.  I  t pinned the foam onto the display board's and then used clear push pins to hang on the walls.  Walla.  Portable and only 4 small push pin holes in the wall when taken down.  Also this way of hanging allows you to move the panels around to find what works best for you.  I'm very happy with this product it is working very well but I'm thinking how to keep it clean over time. Lol.
