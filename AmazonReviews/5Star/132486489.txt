these strings are amazing. They have great sustain, feel silky smooth to the touch, and on a good set of stainless steel frets, they bend like nothing I've ever seen (while managing to stay in tune). They have some really nice output, especially on the Dimarzio Virtual Vintage Blues strat pickups (neck).
