It has a sweeter tone compared to my plastic Garklein.  My one frustration is that the fingering appears to be slightly different between the two recorders, and the layout of the bottom two holes is quite different from my plastic recorder.  Still... it's worth the slight inconvenience to have a sweeter tone.
