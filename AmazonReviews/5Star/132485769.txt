I've never picked up a guitar in my life, but have played the uke for a bit and wanted to try out guitar.  So, speaking as someone who doesn't really know much about the very technical aspects of the instrument, I love this thing, especially because I just want to knock around on it and pick up some basics.  I'm not looking to be the next guitar superstar.<br /><br />I bought in black, and right out of the box it was shiny and beautiful.  As soon as I tuned it I tried out a few chords and it sounds really nice.  Like I said, I'm not an expert, but to my untrained ear it does the job.  Maybe someday with a lot more practice I'd invest in a more expensive guitar, but for right now, it's perfect, and the price was right.<br /><br />Only downside is that I wish it had come with a few picks and at least a cheap gig bag of some sort. It's a bare bones package, which is fine considering the price, but a few extra goodies would've made the deal even sweeter.
