I am new to violin and my first set of strings were Dominants and they were around $50.<br />I used them for two months and everytime I started to practice I was tuning my violin.  I am new to violin so I just thought this was normal.  I then noticed they were not sounding as good.  I cleaned them and this helped a little but still they did not sound great.  At my last lesson my violin teacher said that I probably need to change them.<br /><br />So I decided to try the helicore strings.  I had read some good reviews online.  I am learning classical style but evidentially want to play bluegrass as well.  I put these on and they instantly sounded better (but most new strings do).  However the more I practiced I noticed I did not have to turn everytime.  This was a pleasant surprise.  I would say I am having to tune about 1/5th of the time compared to the dominants.<br /><br />Pros: Great value for the sound.  So far much less toning than Dominant strings.<br /><br />Cons: I do notice a &#34;sizzle&#34; sound when I play really slowly.  Mostly noticed up close.  This is not something that bothers me at all.  You really have to listen to hear it.<br /><br />I will be buying these strings and not dominants from now on.  Oh and did I mention they are $10 cheaper per set.
