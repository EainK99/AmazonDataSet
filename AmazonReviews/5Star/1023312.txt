I am very pleased with these strings.  I use them on a custom built P Bass replica with a vintage, threaded barrel bridge and Fender original P Bass pickups.  Excellent thump; I play a lot of classic rock and blues, so they're perfect for me.  I tried the D'Addario Chromes on two different basses and could not bring myself to like them.  These are much better.
