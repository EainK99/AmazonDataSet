This little guitar is very handy to travel with - or just practice scales on while watching TV.  The plug-in leg rest is too slippery to be useful, but I found slipping a length of clear vinyl tubing over it solved my problem.  Just wet the inside of the tubing with water first and you can slide it into place.
