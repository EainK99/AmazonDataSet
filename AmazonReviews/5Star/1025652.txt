This is my second SP-2. I bought the first from Guitar Center for twice the price.<br />I've never had a problem with these pedals (yet). I own a Yamaha piano with a janky sustain; it lead to many a panicked performance when the sustain became stuck on, and we knew it to be a problem with the piano. However, this pedal minimizes these occurrences.<br />Like a previous comment about Yamaha pianos, when you're plugging it in, make sure the piano is off ,turn the switch on the bottom to the right, and depress the pedal while turning the piano. It's a trick I learned in high school and it 'soothes' the piano into accepting it more often. I wouldn't say it's a problem with the piano, just a recurring problem with Yamaha pianos.<br />Anyway, I enjoy it and have never had a problem. I just bought another because I have two pianos.
