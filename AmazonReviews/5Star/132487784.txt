I've had this guitar for a couple days and I still can't believe what a great deal it was. Fit and finish is really nice and after a little set-up it plays really well. First off, I must say it was a miracle it made it to me in one piece. It was shipped in a thin cardboard box that was half open and a little crushed on one end. I fully expected to find a bunch of broken parts inside, but, not a scratch on it. Like others have said, it does need some set-up. The truss rod was loose as were the tuners and the first string tuner was crooked and had to be repositioned. No big deal at all. The bridge required only minor height adjustment and no intonation adjustment was needed. The neck is beautiful, I had no issues with rough fret ends like some have had. Maybe this has been resolved. The strings it ships with aren't horrible but they aren't great either, I changed them right away and it stays in tune much better now. I play mandolin/banjo in a country band and just wanted to let my inner teenager rock out a bit. This guitar is going to fit my needs perfectly. I also expect it will find its way onto the stage occasionally. This instrument is way, way more than I expected for the price.
