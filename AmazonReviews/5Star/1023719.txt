The Tannoy Reveal 502 Monitors are rather impressive. They are naturally flat sounding (which is what you want for studio mixing) compared to other speakers in their price range. Don't get me wrong, they have decent bass, mid, and treble response but they don't naturally color the sound like others do. I've compared these tp KRK Rokit 5 Generation 3's and JBL LSR305's and I personally like them better. I'd recommend these to anyone looking for 5&#34; studio monitors under $300 each.
