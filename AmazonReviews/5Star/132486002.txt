Great pick, good attack, solid tone, good grip, nice shape and tip . . . I play in MDC, an old school hardcore band, and for a 1 1/4 hour set, I burn through 2 or 3 of these, but they're worth it.  I use light top, heavy bottom D'Addario EXL140s, and that makes a great combination.  I am also trying out their PickBoy Ceramic 1.00, which has the Dunlop/Herco shape, but with a raised bumpy surface.  I also really like the Red Bear picks, fake tortoise and white, but they're too expensive and grind down too fast, imho, best used for steel string.
