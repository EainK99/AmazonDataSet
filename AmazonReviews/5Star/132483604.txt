Okay, there has not been a proper review of this wonderful instrument yet. Lets fix that.<br /><br />This is by far one of the greatest guitars I have ever played. It has a mesmerizing sound that I would expect from a American made strat. The neck is super clean and fast. The floyd rose is a must have for any serious jammers.<br /><br />Lets start with the review:<br /><br />Floyd Rose trem system: 5/5 stars. WOW! The Floyd Rose is the un challenged tremolo system and has been for years. This trem system is super smooth and holds tune like crazy. I have been playing this guitar for 3 weeks, 2 hours a day, every day. Using the trem and it is still in perfect tune. No joke. You can go crazy and the Floyd and once you let go it goes strait back into tune. You can actually touch the bar to the body of the guitar and release it, and it will still be in perfect tune. The locks on the neck come with a wrench to fasten them down. theses are a fantastic idea. These help keep the guitar in tune and boy do they work. The actual trem action is super smooth. You can swing it all over the place with out a bite in the middle, which may not seem impressive but is.<br /><br />The neck: 5/5 The neck is super. It is extremely easy to play with. It is the same with as most other strats but a little thiner. It is not glossed, so your hands do not stick when attempting to play quickly. Plus, if you are used to strats, you can pick this up and be adjusted immediately. The lay out is exactly the same as all other strats. That being said, the frets are a little taller, and the neck is more speed aimed. BUT, this still plays just the same as all other classic strats. This neck is also a little more round then most strat necks. This makes it more comfortable, or at least for me. In short this neck is one of the better I have ever played<br /><br />Body: 4/5 The body is a very dense wood. It is actually heavier than most strats. I was a little disappointed by this. I thought this was going tobe a light guitar. But since it is so dense it plays very sharply. The highs a crisp and acute. The paint is very nice and thick and thus far seems like it will last. It is a strait down the middle shine, not flat but not gloss.<br /><br />Switches: 5/5 not much to say here. They work as they should. Very smooth and consistant.<br /><br />Pick ups/ sound: 8/5 yeah its that good....These pick ups sound just like my friends thousand dollar american made strat. NO JOKE (HE EVEN AGREES). The hum-bucker is very nice and bright with plenty of crunch. That being said it isn't ESP style, over aggressive. They have very clear sound even when pushed to the point or crazyness. They still allow you to hear the annunciation of each note. The Humbucker has a very nice classic 90's style grunge sound. With bright vibrant crackle with out to much mud. The two single coils have typical fender pop. They can be very clean or they can deliver funky snappy pop. With the tube amps runin' this thing screams! That humbucker will make you cry its so good!<br /><br />Over all: But this, you will not regret it. It is a truly amazing instrument at a supper good price. How ever please take note. I wouldn't recommend this to a first time player. The Floyd Rose is awesome, but is does require a certain know how to set it up properly. So ask your teacher if they think that this would be the guitar for you and if they know there way around a floyd rose. If you are teaching your self and you are going to listen to my advice I would recommend the HSS with the synchronized trem. It has the same pick ups so you are getting almost the same thing. In conclusion, if you are looking for a Fender that is more grunge geared and reasonably priced this is the one for you.
