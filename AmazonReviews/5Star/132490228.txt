As usual, the only people posting reviews are the ones complaining. This thing WORKS GREAT. Maybe these folks are using computers from 2003 and expecting high-end stuff like this to still work on them. Maybe the Windows drivers are the source of the problem. I can only speak for myself, using a decent iMac, everything installed and works great. I plugged it into my monitors, headphones and played some songs, I plugged in a Mic and a Guitar, it's all awesome. The fact that it comes with Guitar Rig 6 is like getting $400 of stuff for free! I could play with the myriad of effects and amps for days! I haven't tested the MIDI out yet, but I don't see why it won't work since its simpler than audio. I'd suspect if you don't have a fully updated computer with a good amount of RAM, that you will experience problems since this thing basically bypasses your entire sound card. If you're up to date though, you couldn't ask for more for the price. This thing is solid, looks sleek sitting under my iMac and I love the little lights to let me know what's going on. It's my first NI hardware purchase, probably won't be my last.<br /><br />UPDATE: I think I've tried everything that this thing claims to do now, and it works. I've had it drive a outside hardware synth while simultaneously recording its audio output, it works great and stays in time with my DAWS tempo. I really have zero complaints. People even tell me my Skype calls sound crystal clear and better than their boss' $300 conference mic/headset.
