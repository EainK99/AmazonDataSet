I just wish it came in a rosewood colored background, now I'm going to have to somehow dye my fretboard to match the tie I got for my birthday today.  I've heard you can use saddle dye, I think I'll give that a try ;-)  In all seriousness though, this really is a nice tie or I wouldn't have bothered to look it up to review it.
