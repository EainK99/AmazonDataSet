It is well made and pretty quiet but not silent at full speed. The fans blow much more than my desktop tower fans but is quieter. I taped the temp sensor probe that comes with it onto my Behringer Powerplay Pro-8 amp. The fans are mounted on the top so I get an accurate display of the amp and nearby equipment temperature. Its more expensive than some of the others rack fan options but I got many features so its a fair price.
