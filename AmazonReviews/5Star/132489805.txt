I've been playing the guitar for eleven years now and I have never had an amplifier compliment the sound of an instrument until this one. It also, believe it or not, works for beginners who do not have any other effects to add, as it has hundreds of effects built in! You can use the effects of the amp or even add yours in. I am deeply satisfied. Definitely recommended.
