Well packing was good and delivery was prompt.....installation was simple however package did not contain any mounting clips so make sure to get some locally or order them here online. All in all I am pleased with the rope lighting...it is not as green as the picture shows...it's closer to a lime yellow and the brightness of these LCD lights is not as bright as your standard rope lighting but the low energy cost associated with LED might be the trade off that makes the difference for you
