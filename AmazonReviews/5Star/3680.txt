Life before Lava: I was always chasing down an intermittent signal dropout, ground buzz, or overall noise floor. I had a mix of patch cables from various sources that all checked fine on a cable tester.<br /><br />Life with Lava Tightrope: so far, 0 failures, 0 ground loops/buzz/hum, and a VERY LOW noise floor.<br /><br />I didn't really buy into the hype before, preferring to spend dollars on the pedals instead. I'm now a believer; every component matters, and not all cables are created equal.<br /><br />These were trivially easy to put together after I watched the tutorial on YT. It all worked on the first attempt.
