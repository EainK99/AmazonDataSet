Well, what can I say that hasn't been said? The QSC K series continues to live up to its reputation. I purchased two of these to use as front fills for festival shows, and even as mains for small coffee shop  and DJ gigs. First off, construction is solid. The plastic enclosure is sturdy and the grill is extremely quality feeling. The aesthetic of these speakers is hard to top - they just blend in and look great everywhere. Sound quality is outstanding both for recorded music playback and for live sound. The deep mode is a fun feature, although I rarely get use out of it for my purposes. These speakers are lightweight and easily managed by any adult of remotely normal size.<br /><br />Input options are wonderful, with two inputs (mic/line switch is handy!) that have independent gain knobs and can be summed into a mono output for daisy chaining. RCA inputs are useful for hooking up an external music source, and the power cable included has a locking feature to prevent it from being pulled out accidentally.<br /><br />For those who would question the price of these speakers, or the sound output of an 8 inch speaker I just have to say try and see! If a local music shop has these, definitely give them a listen because they are very loud and very clear for such a small, lightweight box. Well worth the price of admission!
