This is an excellent tuner...easy to see and a so simple a bassist could use it. I got them for just over eight bucks apiece and my bill was 25.02, so I got three with free shipping. About the only odd thing is a Sharpie won't leave a mark so I can't write my name on them. Comes with the battery also. The display rotates to easy seeing position too. I have no reason to spend any more than what I did for a clip on tuner. I still have a Boss T-3 on the pedalboard. These are great for hitting a jam and not embarrassing yourself by playing out of tune. Excellent tuner for very cheap. I liked that the instructions say don't leave it on your guitar as you could damage an older finish. Most people will just leave it on the headstock.....they warn you. I appreciated that.
