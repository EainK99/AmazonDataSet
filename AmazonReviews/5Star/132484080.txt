I am on a military base in Afghanistan teaching yoga in a room surrounded by cement walls.  The class ranges from 25-80 and I needed a easy portable PA system so that the students could hear me.  I looked and looked and found this little gem.  The first time I used it in class the students were so happy to finally hear me and many of them made comments about how much they liked it as well. It's light and fits into my backpack, which I then carry on my bike to class. It's very easy to use and turn on.  I was suprised at how well the headset part actually worked, since I read so many reviews about the headset being difficult.  It's not perfect, but it does work well.  If you are using this to instruct a fitness class, I would recommend that after you recieve it in the mail, practice using it while you work out so you can adapt easier while in class.  Great product for price and function.  Very Happy!
