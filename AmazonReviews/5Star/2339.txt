The sound of this instrument surprised me. I've been playing the shakuhachi for 4 years and was astonish by how it sounds for the price. It is a bit thinner than professional shakuhachi and sound exactly like a concert grade shakuhachi, very impressed.  I will purchase more later in the future. the kinko is well made in there.
