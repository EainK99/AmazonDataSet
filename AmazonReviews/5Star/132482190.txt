My old bow fell apart which was not totally a surprise as my violin teacher had been telling me it needed to be restrung.  Since I don't like the violin shop in my vicinity and don't want to give them any more of my business unless absolutely necessary, I decided to order this bow from amazon as it is a reasonable price with quick delivery.  I am very happy I did so.  I am an advanced beginner/intermediate violinist and this bow meets my needs perfectly until such time as I get a higher quality violin and even then I will continue to have it as a back-up.  It is slightly longer than my old bow which is 40+ years old, so perhaps this is the modern length or perhaps my old bow was sized more for  an 11 yr. old which was my age when it was purchased.  In any event, I have adjusted to the slightly longer length with no problem.  Re my new bow, I worried it might be damaged in transit as other amazon purchasers of other bow brands have complained that they received warped items, but happy to report the packaging was excellent and my bow arrived in perfect condition.  I would highly recommend this bow to beginning and intermediate violinists...happy bowing!
