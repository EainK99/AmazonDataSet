My wife has been learning the guitar for a couple of years.<br /><br />When she first started, she was playing an acoustic and doing the singer-songwriter stuff.<br /><br />But at some point recently, she wanted to play a rock song, and ended up picking up a cheap Les Paul.<br /><br />So she stole my little Fender Rumble 15 Bass amp to play on. It worked, but it was all clean and didn't really capture the high end.<br /><br />Looking around, this seemed like the best alternative to having to get too complicated with pedals and everything, with separate knobs for voice and effects. I was a little worried, since she sometimes doesn't like overly complicated things. The Rumble just has a volume and a three-band equalizer, and this is more complex.<br /><br />Thankfully, she is happy. The only drawback is that it is small. She was telling her teacher about the new amp, and he asked, &#34;Why didn't you get the 40?&#34;. I told her we can get that when she starts wanting to gig.
