This thing is amazing. I have a gain hungry mic and the cloudlifter makes it so much better! One thing to be aware of though; it needs power and doesn't have a way to add external power. Most interfaces have phantom power BUT if your interface is USB powered than this can cause some grief. My advice is to always use an externally powered interface whenever possible. Since I switched to an externally powered interface I have had zero issues with the cloudlifter/mic combo and it sounds amazing.
