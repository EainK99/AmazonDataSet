EDIT, September 2015: This year, around May, the screw I tighten to keep the desk at a good reading height failed. The metal nut stripped the threads on the metal screw; it wouldn't tighten properly, and the desk no longer stayed up where I could read the music. Luckily, the screw that attaches the desk to the stand was the same size, and much less relevant to me, so I swapped them out. That worked for a few months, but the second screw eventually failed, too. (Why'd all this happen now, not years ago? Maybe this year I got into the habit of overtightening? [but I had to prop up some awfully heavy books!].)  I got some same-sized M6 screws (1&#34; or 1-1/2&#34;) and wing nuts from the hardware store to replace the original knob screws and nuts. Works great!  ------- Original review: I've had this stand for a year now, and I love it. It's great for outdoor concerts-- everyone else's stand flops over like a windsail, but my stand doesn't budge!  Sets up and folds up easily, no fuss. (Though it took me several months to stop twiddling the shelf-detachment knob instead of the shelf-angle knob; they're in similar locations, and I couldn't keep them straight. But that's my fault, not the stand's!)  The edges of the music-holding part are a little thick (the metal is rolled), so my old wind clips and clothespins don't fit it very well. Nothing a sheet of plexiglass or Musicmaide clips can't fix.
