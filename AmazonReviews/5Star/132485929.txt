This guitar has excellent all around sound and great play-ability.  Intonation is good up the neck.  The nut over the end pin jack was missing on mine.  Luckily, I had a spare in my box of odds and ends.  It does not come with a strap pin on the heel, so I installed my own.  I can tell that the sound will get increasingly better with playing time.  There's a lot of &#34;bang for the buck&#34; here.
