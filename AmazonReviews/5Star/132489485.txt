I originally purchased this to work with a Sony Walkman Professional cassette recorder, then a Sony voice activated recorder. Used it today to record a 3 hour long rehearsal on my MacBook Pro. I used Audacity which lets me control the input and output levels, and ran a test. Also installed the Mp3 codes so that I could save the file as an MP3. The recording came out very clear, both for spoken voice and singing. I know there were some old reviews here saying it doesn't with anything but Sony but I think they're wrong. Perhaps they bought a bootleg by mistake. I also will use this to record on my iPad. Small and portable. Now will have a permanent place in my bag.
