I could not be happier with this guitar.  Do you believe in love at first sight?  I do, and un-boxing this guitar induced a case of it in me. This is the guitar I have been seeking for years and simply did not know it.  It is perfectly set up and intonated right out of the case.  The floating bridge and the action are precisely how I want them.  The guitar plays like a dream, and the pickups!  Oh my goodness!  They are Dimarzio Transition HBs and with the use of the 5 way blade switch, this guitar can sound like a Les Paul or quack just exactly like a Strat.  No exaggeration.  I wish I could have had this guitar 5 years ago and saved myself thousands of dollars and countless hours looking for my perfect guitar.  The search is over.<br /><br />P.S.  Buy from Music123!  The guitar and case were in immaculate condition upon arrival.
