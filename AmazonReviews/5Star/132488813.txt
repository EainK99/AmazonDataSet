Had a buzzer at the 13th fret that I was able to level before I polished the frets and applied a Tung Oil finish which brought out the grain beautifully. I installed Fender locking tuners, LSR nut, and, coupled with the Fender Bigsby, it sounds great with lots of sustain. No problem with setup or staying in tune. This is a \\"standard\\" neck in that the truss only corrects one way and that is up toward the frets. It will not \\"bi-flex\\" to put a downward bow into the neck. You will have to set bridge and nut height to be compatible for your preferred strum style. This is great for a finger picking style or a light pick. Not really a \\"Metal\\" neck. The neck was perfectly straight with the truss all the way loose as I used a Luther leveling rule to check it. It's a great neck for the purpose intended. Slightly shorter fret spacing and narrower neck width. Better suited for playing scale patterns vs. chords progressions. Most especially if you have very thick fingers. I can see someone with thick fingers having trouble chording on this neck. Not that it wouldn't be possible but you would have to work at it a little. I have \\"average\\" width fingers and had no problems playing chords or scales. It is more comfortable and faster to me than the standard \\"wide\\" boards out there when scaling.<br />Just wanted to help people make an informed decision and save some time and aggravation.
