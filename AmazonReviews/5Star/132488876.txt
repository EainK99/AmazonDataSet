This is a well made parts as suggested by most reviewers here.<br /><br />The Stagepas300 speakers do not have the speaker stand mount so I have to install these at the bottom.<br />However, there are 2 screws (M8) built-in to mount this bracket.<br />A 5/16\\" dia hole fender washers (from chained hardware store) with total surface of 1.5\\" installed with each screw to strengthened the mounting base.<br /><br />I did not use the small self tapping screw provided.<br />I agree with other reviewers to buy a bigger screw and may be washer if you have to mount this under something that does not have any holes yet.
