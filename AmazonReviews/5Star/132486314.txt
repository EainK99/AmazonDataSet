A good instrument cable should be very quiet, and not cost more than a $1.50 per foot. This cable fits that bill perfectly, and in these regards is far superior than most other cables out there (Monster, et. al). I've gigged this cable a LOT, and it's always held up for me. Don't let big names fool you, Lava is a standout company!
