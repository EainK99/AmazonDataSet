I don't care what this is emulating. And I don't care about any of the technical details. I already have a pretty 'colored' sounding setup. I have a rickenbacker and a fender with p-90 pickups,  with a brownface old princeton, and an old Ampeg J-12. I don't care about anything but sound. I tend to find people pretty foolish with all their blah blah about the technical details. What really counts is how it sounds. And this thing really gives you some very interesting character and a variety of tones to choose from. And a 3 band EQ at the top is just awesome. Diddle the knobs and you'll have a really wide variety of tones... love it.
