These headphones are absolutely worth all the hype they've received.  I did a test and listened to the entire Rumours album from start to finish and really was able to hear the strings, horns, ect from left to right.  I'm not an audiophile or anything, but listening to music now has become so much more enjoyable than ever before!  Get a pair of these, you won't be sorry!!
