The quality blow my mind, since it is almost perfect, I had to cut the pickup space a little bit to fit a EMG, but no big deal. It is electric shielded(witch reduces outside signals and interferences on the pickups and circuit) and fits almost all Fender and Squier strats. It's just as good as an original replacement.
