I'm a pro videographer for 20 years and I know that wind screens would help.  In my situation, I needed a white color wind screen for my white lav mic for my 3/8\\" wide lav mics.  I could find smaller ones but none would fit the lav mics I have.  These lav mics came with my three yr old Sony UHF kits that I painted white for events my client wears white tux.  I dumped the rest of the old kit cause they were in the illegal 700 Htz range.  I could not find any white wind screen online so I decided to go with these beige color.  I did a true A/B test (with/with out WS), and got great results with these and can't believe for just a $1 each (5 in the pack).  I just wish they make them in white instead of beige.  I recommend this WS!
