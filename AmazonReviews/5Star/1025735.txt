I bought this horn for my grandson in 2013. He has never touched this horn with his bare hands. He has always worn white dress gloves. It's nice to see that he likes this trumpet that much. His director/ instructor was so impressed that he told him that the trumpet was too nice to take outside for marching band. So he still has to use his older horn for outside use.
