This case is probably going to be the largest case in your arsenal, but it protects well, feels sturdy and your guitar won't move around inside. It's got a gigantic accessory compartment to fit your cables, straps, two, possibly 3 pedals (or one large pedal/small Multieffects unit) and overall makes me feel like my Explorer is safe.  It's heavy, even heavier with your explorer in there. But you play a heavy guitar. Case provides great bang for your buck.
