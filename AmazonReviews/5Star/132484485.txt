The three guitars I own all have D'Addario EXL110w strings. Bright and crisp when playing clean. When playing with distortion they have a nice thick growl.<br /> The wound 3rd is a godsend. No more \\"sick cat in heat\\" tone from unwound 3rds. No more randomly going out of tune. Despite what some people might say, I've never had ANY problems bending the G.<br /> Without a doubt, the best strings I've ever had. I've used GHS, Ernie Ball, Dunlop, DR, etc. These RARELY go out of tune. They keep their tone a lot longer than most. As far as breaking, I've had 3 strings break in the 5 years I've been using the EXL110w strings. Compare to the countless ones (about one every month to two months) that broke in the 5 years of playing before switching to D'addario.<br /> I honestly cannot recommend these strings enough.
