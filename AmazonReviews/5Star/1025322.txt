excellent, rugged gig bag.  I bought it for a large dread-bodied Epiphone.  It was a tight fit, but it's been working well and has actually loosened up a bit so it's not a challenge to fit in the case any longer.<br />I was concerned because the measurements were exactly dead-on with my guitar - but I took the chance and it paid off!  Good deal, too.
