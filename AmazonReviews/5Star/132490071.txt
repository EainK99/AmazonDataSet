I bought this wax to use on jewelry I make from polymer clay, and it's terrific: it leaves my pieces with a super-shiny professional look. It saves me from having to use my bench grinder to buff away a lot of the surface and design, and also saves my shoulders and elbows the wear and tear from sanding absurd amounts with ever-increasing grits of sandpaper to get the shine I want. I'm really happy with No. 1 Wax, and at this price, it's the best bargain in my toolbox! I only wish I'd found it a lot sooner.
