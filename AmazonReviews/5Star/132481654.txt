I purchased this just to give my room some personality and to add some extra fun to watching scary movies in bed. I love the remote that comes with the light. You don't need to get up but still need to be fairly close. The light itself is not extremely bright so it’s perfect for mood lighting. Tons of options in terms of color and effects. Would definitely suggest you buy because it’s worth the price. Enjoy!
