I ordered this for my son's 3/4 size bass, even though many of the reviews indicated that it would only fit a cello. At the price (under $2 including shipping), I thought it was worth the risk. I'm happy to say it did fit the bass. So if your bass has a small end pin, there is a good chance this tip will work for a bass in addition to a cello. I think the endpin was about 1/4&#34; (but I didn't measure it).
