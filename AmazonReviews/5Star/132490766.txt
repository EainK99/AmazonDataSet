Love everything about these buds.  Yes, they may take a little bit of time to find what size fits your ear.  But once you do.....beautiful sound.  Used to use Klipsch S4 and S4i, but they had durability issues (my only real qualm with them actually).  But these buds step up the sound quality (just a tad, but it's noticeable, especially in highs and the overall body of the sound is just deeper and more pronounced).  The Shure's come in with a bit more weight, but feel much more sturdy.  Good $100 replacement, very happy I moved from my Klipsch
