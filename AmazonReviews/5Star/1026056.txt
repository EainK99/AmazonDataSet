Very nice and comfortable.  I ordered two of these which are so much better than the cheaper leather guitar straps I had been using.  My biggest problem was finding straps that were long enough as I have pretty wide shoulders (52&#34; jacket size).  Even straps that were listed as extra long seemed to fall short.  These straps are perfect and I could actually extend them out two more loops.  The padding is very comfortable yet thin enough not to get in the way.  Seems to be very well stitched and constructed.
