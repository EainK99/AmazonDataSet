I take this backpacking with me.  Nothing beats the sound of this native american style flute when sitting atop a 13,000' peak overlooking the range during a sunset.  The basics were easy to learn, and the advanced playing styles are slowly coming to me.  I'm learning to simply play whatever my heart feels and 9/10 times it sounds amazing.<br /><br />A note - higher elevations are less dense in air, and as such, the flute becomes increasingly difficult to play as elevation increases.  Playing at 13,000' is pretty tough.<br /><br />I use a gun sock to protect the flute, which seems to work very well.
