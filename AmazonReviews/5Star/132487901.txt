Looks great with my studio setup.  I have a CAD AS32 reflection filter that matches this thing perfectly.  My desk also has the perforated metal thing going on, so it is nice to have a rack panel that matches the rest of my equipment aesthetically.  Good quality, good venting, good looks.  Not much else to say.  Get this one if you are looking for a vented 2 space rack panel.
