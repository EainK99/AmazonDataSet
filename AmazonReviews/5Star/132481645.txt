I was ready to make the jump to a &#34;real&#34; turntable. My first record player was the portable Numark PT01. It's a great little turntable for people who are just starting out, but I've been collecting vinyl for over ten years now. It was time to get a better player.<br /><br />Of course I questioned whether or not I should splurge like $400 on some high end player, but I just saw how highly rated this one was, and for under $100, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />I could not be happier. It sounds great and I love the auto needle setting and auto stop features. If you want great sound without breaking your bank, go for this turntable.<br /><br />Can't wait to upgrade the needle in the future.
