Exactly what I wanted. I have a work iPad which I need a full time keyboard but recently purchased a personal iPad. I don't need a keyboard so I was just looking for a case that offered the ability for a portrait use. The quality of the case is nice, the ability to turn the iPad to a portrait view is nice, overall I love it.
