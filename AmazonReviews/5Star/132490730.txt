Your loudspeakers are the most critical components you use to verify the quality of your work. No matter how good your mixer, mics, preamps, cables, and other pieces of gear that you've invested in, you're not truly hearing what your recordings sound like until you isolate your monitors from their environment. This is where the Auralex MoPADs come in. MoPAD Monitor Isolation Pads provide sonic isolation between your monitors and whatever your monitors are resting on, INSTANTLY improving the accuracy of your entire monitoring system. MoPAD-XL is the big brother of the MoPAD and is designed for larger loudspeaker. MoPAD-XL's are designed to improve the performance of any loudspeaker up to 100lbs. A pair of MoPAD-XL's can support one 200lb horizontal loudspeaker.
