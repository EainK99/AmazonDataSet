I started piping in 1995 with a different brand of plastic practice chanter and it was okay.  I eventually moved to a long Gibson African Blackwood practice chanter, which I love.  Now that I am teaching piping students (I hold Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Music Education) I have begun ordering these for them, and they are amazing!  I would never give up my ABW Gibson PC, but I have to admit, when my students' Gibson Standard Poly Practice Chanters come in, I play them at least a day before I give them to my students because they sound so great!<br /><br />They are very well balanced, and in tune right out of the box.  They sound good with the Gibson PC reeds (really made by Greg Abbott), and even though I love them, I think the Walsh PC reeds aren't right for this.  The BEST sounding reed is the new cane (yes, I said cane) practice chanter reed made by Chris Apps, but it's pretty expensive.  The Gibson reed sounds fine, and no tape will be needed with that combo.
