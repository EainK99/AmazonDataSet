I have not treated myself to many headphones in the past, usually I wouldn't spend more than 20 bucks on a new pair , and just replace them as needed. I did not know what I was missing, in quality and overall value. I am rediscovering my own music collection one song at a time thanks to these headphones. My love for these headphones is embarrassing, but I do not fault them on their price one bit.
