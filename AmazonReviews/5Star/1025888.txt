I am using this at a warehouse-converted-to-church-sanctuary.  I would say about 75 feet from the podium to soundboard and reception is great.  The antennas really do help.  The clear mic is the way to go.  The transmitter seems to be more efficient and eats up less batteries compared to previous models.  The sound is clear, and suitable for digital recording for posting online.
