My daughter gave me one of these straps for an Epiphone Dot semi-hollow body that I bought about 10 years ago. I've always liked it, and admired it, but didn't want to spend that much on myself for a second guitar that I built (I call it Zatocaster, it's a strat-like model). So I lived with a cheap nylon strap on the Zatocaster for about two years before realizing how much better the Levy's strap worked. It's not just a matter of how good it looks; these strong, comfortable straps become an extension of the guitar. Maybe it's the weight, maybe it's the non-slip-ish-ness, maybe it's the solid attachment to the strap buttons. I can't explain it, but I can say that I'll never use a cheap strap again.<br /><br />After spending time with guitar straps I appreciate the styles that have a long thin tongue for attachment at the bottom. Other styles, that have the same width throughout the strap, sometimes rub against my elbow. These Levy straps have the tongue design which, although comfortable, is a bit awkward to adjust. But once you find the right length the tongue provides two attachment positions. I find that the end-most position works well for standing, and the next position works well for sitting. So there is no need to readjust the overall length once you get it tuned to your body and playing style. The strap is easily adjusted to suit sitting or standing without changing the overall length.
