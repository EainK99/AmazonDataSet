So I don't write reviews often, but this deserves one.<br /><br />The Sound: Beautiful. It responds perfectly to the EQ's, and has a wonderful, clear tone. I love it.<br /><br />Construction: Solid construction, with no faults or factory issues. It is smooth, has good weight to it, and is seemingly durable although I haven't dropped it yet. I did however buy it used, so it has probably been dropped before.<br /><br />Shipping: I didn't buy this one from Amazon, I actually bought it from a guy on craigslist in town.<br /><br />Overall a wonderful bass drum microphone. It gives my bass drum an awesome sound, just how I set it up to be.
