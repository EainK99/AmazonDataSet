When I was looking into becoming a vinyl DJ I was torn between two turntable options. The Stanton T92 USB, and obviously, the Technics 1200. I ended up going with the Stantons simply because I heard they were good enough to DJ with and I wasn't made of money. I bought both of mine used for about 450 total.<br /><br />They have plenty of torque for a mixing style DJ, but sometimes I run into issues with 180 gram vinyl and some vinyl having tighter center holes than others. I've had to take a file to the center hole of a few records so they platter doesn't stop spinning. Sometimes (not frequently, just every once an a while) I have to give the platter a little spin with my hand while cueing up a record.<br /><br />Also the stock slip mats suck for djing. Replace them asap if you plan to DJ with these. I noticed a huge difference right away.<br /><br />And one more complaint is the lack of a needle light. If you play in a darker room it might pay to invest in some miniature LED lights.<br /><br />If you want to DJ without breaking the bank, they will work great and you'll like them.
