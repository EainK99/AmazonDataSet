I love this tuner! I'm not quite sure why other reviewers had problems installing the battery as I found it really easy. The instructions in the package were very clear. The tuner is easy to use and very accurate. I especially like the graphic display which makes it very easy to tweak each string to achieve perfect tuning. All-in-all, I'm very impressed with it and would (and will) recommend it to my musician friends.
