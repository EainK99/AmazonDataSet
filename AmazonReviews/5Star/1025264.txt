[[VIDEOID:a668fad7d351ed0611208e3e4ee81b97]] I wanted a good microphone for creating online courses. The CAD Audio was recommended, and so I ordered the CAD Audio GXL2600USB Large Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Microphone. It comes with a shock mount, desk stand and USB cable (10 feet). It is very easy to set up; essentially plug and play. Initially I had problems getting it to work the way I wanted with Adobe Premiere Elements, but I discovered additional controls in APE that allowed me to adjust the sound level to an acceptable one. I would imagine that a microphone like this would need some kind of amplifier, and that would be a welcome addition. However, with the right microphone placement and voice level, the quality is very clear.
