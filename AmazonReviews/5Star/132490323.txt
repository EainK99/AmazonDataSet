After just a few swipes of rosin this bow sounded identical to my antique Roth Glasser bow with black and white hair--a very common and cheap bow that people find at garage sales, flea markets, etc.  which makes for a nice comparison.<br /><br />This bow features a *very* nice rubber pad, silver wire wrap and all white hair. The screw was a little tight when trying to get the bow tensioned, but it works. This bow feels a little more `lively' than my R&G. Possibly this is because  it's 2.75\\" longer (4/4 vs 3/4) and is heavier and there is a bit more space between the hair and the stick when tensioned (the camlin can get very straight if you want).<br /><br />The rear of the frog (which is some sort of brown wood, not plastic or black ebony wood) has sharp corners--but it's the rear part that your fingers don't touch anyway.  The rear of the stick, between the pad and the screw is octagonal. That's very nice: some people were complaining that (other) cheap bows are just a round stick all the way to the rear. The silver-ish wire wrap is covered in a clear plastic sleeve that I'm leaving in place.<br /><br />When de-tensioning (unscrewing) the bow the screw actually backed out of the stick and left the bow tensioned. I pushed it inward and it seemed to loosen up. I've had that happen with another (newer) bow, so that may be something that takes a little `wear in' to get right. If you loosen the screw and it comes out but the bow is still tensioned: screw the screw back in a bit, push it inward hard--it will slide in and the bow will instantly de-tension. The next time you use it, it will screw in/out perfectly. My R&G never does this-but it's probably very `worn in' after 40 years.<br /><br />My R&G bow has a plastic slide that says \\"Roth-Glasser\\", this bow has a block of pearl looking material! The eyes are also pearl-looking instead of cheap white plastic like so many bows have. There's also a pearl-ish looking eye at the end of the tension screw.<br /><br />I have a blonde Stradivarius copy, but I bought this bow as a gift for someone who has no bow at all. Now I'm thinking I might keep this and give them my R&G bow instead. A `vintage' R&G bow is worth *TWICE* the ultra cheap price they want for this one, LOL!<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Yes, but: I'm a total newbie at violin; your teacher may recommend something more expensive; I actually bought this to give to someone who has *no* bow--but I like it so much I'm keeping it and giving them my lighter and smaller 3/4 Roth Glasser bow instead. Does it work: yes, cycle the screw a few times to free it up and it does what it's supposed to: hold the hair tight. For me the added heft makes it less stressful for my wrist to play than my 'antique' (but also very low-level) R&G bow.<br /><br />It does what a bow is supposed to do. It actually tensions up-and no hairs have fallen out! Can't ask for much more than that at any price really.blonde Stradivarius copy, but I bought this bow as a gift for someone who has no bow at all.
