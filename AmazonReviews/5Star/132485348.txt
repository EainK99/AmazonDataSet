I purchased this through the Amazon marketplace for slightly over $11 with free shipping.  This was my first stand purchase (for my first acoustic guitar...it has a full sized body) and I wanted something sturdy that would provide great \\"bang for the buck\\".  This stand exceeded my expectations.  The seller (Music123) had it in my hands 4 days after the order was placed.  It came without written directions but they really aren't needed as the stand is very easy to set up.  The rubber on the arms and back of the stand is nice and soft, seems durable as well.  I like the fact that this can be folded up and stored easily in a closet or a guitar case, yet is simple to unfold and provide a rock solid support for my guitar.  Previous reviews on this item were helpful in my decision to buy this particular stand.  For the money it costs I'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to other acoustic guitar owners.
