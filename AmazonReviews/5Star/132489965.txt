I have had this light for 2 years... doing all sorts of gigs with big bands outdoors, indoor soft lighting and have always loved the reliability and its ease of packing it up without worry of breaking a bulb like the old bulb type. It lights the full page, but get the dimmer rheostat to help moderate the brightness on those low light gigs.<br /><br />I have tried the \\"LED book reading lights\\" and this is not like those at all.... those type do not cover the bottom of the page and when you're playing big band music at fast tempos, that is important to me.<br /><br />I am thinking of updating myself to the battery operated Aria Brio for those times where no power is available to all band members.
