I did research for about two months before I actually purchased this system. Had never heard of Musysic before but I can honestly say I would purchase from them again. My wife and I bought this for my daughter since she does sing a lot. She sings in public venues from time to time so we wanted to have some portability with a system that was easy to set up and take down. We have all used this and are all very happy with this purchase. I would definitely recommend this system for others. Thanks for delivering what was promised. It was delivered on time also.
