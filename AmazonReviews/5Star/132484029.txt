Amazing clarity of microphone. Headphones could be more better as part of the entire package. Manufacturer should provide a manual for assembly of the mic and stand, nothing is provided in the box and it is a little difficult for first timers. But on the whole, great deal for someone like me who wants a small home recording setup with minimal hassle!
