For the price- wait.  Hold on. This is Audio Technica. This was amazing for it's price! I saw the name and thought \\"Why the low value?\\" It's a seasoned veteran that knows it's s***. Don't like how sensitive it is when you use it? Remember, a condenser is meant to be clear and crisp. Noise removal is your friend for pre-recordings. Live streams are a little different but none of my viewers complained. :D THEY LOVE IT!
