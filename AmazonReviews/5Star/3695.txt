I have a Bugera V22 Head (I know, Uli Behringer's The Devil - whatever). I've had it for about 3 months. I've been playing for 15 years or so. This is my first &#34;all-tube&#34; amplifier. It sounded better than anything else I've had so far, but I believed with a new set of tubes it could sound better still. I did a little reading and put together a custom set to suit my needs - home studio & practice space (no playing out with this). This model is one of the many out there that start off with the basic Vox AC15 / Fender Blues Junior recipe of 12AX7s & EL84s. The stock tubes in V1 & V2 were OK, but nothing special. Chinese Shuguang 12AX7s re-branded as Bugera 12AX7As. The V22 is a 2-channel amp and the lead/overdrive channel was a little thin and a bit shrill as well. For me, the whole point behind having a 2-channel amp is to get both a great fat clean tone and a huge overdrive sound without needing to use any pedals (I'm not implying that I'm giving up my stompbox habit, just that my goal here is to have a great overdrive sound from just the head as an option). The results: Very low-noise. Slightly less gain over all. The clean channel sounds richer/fuller. The clean channel doesn't break up as early as with the stock tubes (which is what the lead channel is for anyway). Running the preamp section at full tilt, I get the overdrive tone that I was looking for - solid low-end, rich mid-range, and the highs slightly rounded off. Warm and dark, but not muddy. These tubes sound awesome.
