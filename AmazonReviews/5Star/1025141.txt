What I carry as an active percussionist includes not only drumsticks but timbale sticks, claves both large and small, cowbell beaters, triangle and chime sticks,  channel lock pliers, and more. This bag holds it all, and also is easy to work out of during shows. It has now been with me for several years at about 100 -150 shows per year and looks barely used. The leather is tough and I trust this thing to never develop a hole and lose anything I've placed in it. It will last a lifetime and more.
