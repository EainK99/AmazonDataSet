I compared many ukuleles on-line, and finally decided on the Asmus Soprano because it is made of solid tonewood, is affordable, attractive,very reasonably priced, and is professionally set-up for perfect action and playability.  I was not disappointed!  I have so much fun with this ukulele and take it with me whenever I can just in case I get a chance to practice.  This is the first ukulele I have ever owned or played, and I originally bought it as a gift.  I liked it so much that I kept it and had to buy another!  I have acquired many other ukuleles since, but always come back to this one because it is so easy to play and sounds great.  I also purchased all my gig bags from Asmus.
