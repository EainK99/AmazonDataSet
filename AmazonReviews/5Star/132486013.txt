I really like this product other than the inconvenience of having to refill it every few days. Humidipaks by planet waves are nice in the fact that they are much more convenient, but they do no last as long as they say they do. I have also tried to re-humidify the humidipaks and that doesnt work for crap. SO yeah, these Oasis humidifiers are simple, slightly inconvenient, but very effective.
