Had a different type of tuner before and thought this one looked dopey but solid reviews caused me to buy.<br /><br />Glad I did.  This is superior in every way to my other clip-on tuners.  Great buy.  Fast, accurate, chromatic, very tiltable, very gentle on the headstock, etc.  A near-perfect product.
