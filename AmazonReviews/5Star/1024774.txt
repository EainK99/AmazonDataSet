This is an awesome wall holder for saxophone.  It is sturdy and has a good finish.  I used to find it difficult to store the saxophone safely after  use particularly because my 3 year old, ever playful grand daughter  wants to play with it, telling, 'it is mine!'  With this wall holder I am sure that I can keep my sax at a 'safe distance' on the wall.  Besides I am sure that henceforth my saxophone will be an added  piece of art decorating our  interior.<br />My experience with the seller was very good. I am not sure about the price if it bit on the higher side.  However in the absence of much options, I am happy that I got what I wanted for a long time. It was packed well and delivered on time.  I strongly recommend this saxophone wall holder.
