I am extremely satisfied with these headphones. I've been using them for a year now and the sound quality is flawless. I haven't treated them well, accidentally stepping on them on numerous occasions but they have never let me down. They are just as good as when I bought them. Other headphones I've owned only lasted me a few months even weeks. This is practically a steal. I have no gripes. I will definitely be recommending audio-technicas.
