These are just the pins for the portion of LOXX strap locks that are screwed into the guitar, not the portion that goes on your strap. In addition to 3 different screw sets (two screws @ 16mm, four screws @ 22mm), there are two slip on \\"traditional\\" strap fittings that can be used with any of the screws, felt washers and the ubiquitous installation tool.  Why sell these separately and without the portion that goes on your guitar strap? Especially when you buy a standard LOXX system you already get two 16mm screws?  1. You can buy one complete LOXX set separately and then buy this for your other guitar(s) and use one strap on multiple guitars. I do that.  2. You might be concerned about screw lengths so you want a couple of longer lengths. The two screws @ 16mm are the same as you'd get with any other LOXX set, but the four screws @ 22mm are extra long. I used those on my extra-heavy bass guitar, but they're expected to be used if you slip them through the optional strap fittings (which are 6mm wide, so the portion of the screw that goes into the guitar is effectively the same length as the 16mm screw).  And finally:  3. Many people, like me, want a pin that stays as close to the body as possible and that's why we're drawn to the LOXX in the first place (besides their high quality). The tradeoff with that is you can only use the LOXX-equipped guitar with straps that have the LOXX preinstalled. Other strap lock systems have the dual ability to just use it with a stock guitar strap. If you forget your strap with a LOXX-equipped guitar, you can't just borrow one because it would fall off the little pin. So this set has a slip on \\"traditional\\" strap fittings that can be used with any of the screw sets. This gives you the additional option of using your LOXX-equipped guitar with a LOXX-equipped strap OR with a traditional non-customized guitar strap. I use these on my acoustic guitar.  Overall, this is a very thoughtful and useful add-on, and at a fair price.
