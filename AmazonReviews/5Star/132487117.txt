after years of using in ear headphones I am listening to things I haven't heard before even though it is the same music I have listened to multiple times over. They are not stellar in the bass department but the clarity and crispness in which you hear things are amazing.<br /><br />Even though they are not noise cancelling, they do a good job at keeping most of the ambient noise level out. I bring these with me to the laundromat and whenever I travel by train. Otherwise I might get a headache from all the noise. Sometimes you do have to put the volume at 50-80% though to overpower the noise around you but the crispness and clarity remains. My next pair of headphones will definitely be Sennheisers!
