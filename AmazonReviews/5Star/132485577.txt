It appears I'm going to be the first person to give this thing a 5-star endorsement, and I fully admit it's mostly for the sound-to-cost ratio.<br /><br />Quick background where I'm coming from:<br />Have no problems with soft-synths and do frequently use them (I'm a big Propellerhead Reason fan), but that being said, in MOST cases I would still prefer hardware and analog (have a few hardware virtual analog synths and they get get used plenty as well).  Without diving into the analog-vs-digital debate, let's just say it's a personal preference related to the sound.  And that preference does impact my assessment of this product.<br /><br />And this is the first Dave Smith product I've owned (no Prophet 5 experience though I do kick myself for not buying one I found in a pawn shop back in 90's).<br /><br />Positives:<br />- Without going used, where else can you get a synth with 4 analog voices and this programmability for the $800-900 price range?<br />- The sound...I think the brass (saw wave) patches on here are as smooth as butter (yeah, that's subjective, but I also have owned/own a boatload of analog and VA synths to compare it to)<br />- Minimum impact on real estate.  I ended up selling several synths in the last decade just because what they brought to my musical creativity was less than the space they took up in my music room<br />- Since a PC is the centerpiece of my home studio anyway, using the free software to program this thing is fairly easy, and unlike the other reviewer, I've had no bugs or glitches using it<br />- The sound...yes this is a repeat, but it BEARS repeating.  Whether the saw waves, square, pulse width, etc, this thing sounds great and lets you easily program LOTS of phenomenal stuff (albeit with the assistance of software)<br />- Creative routing options on the outputs give you the equivalent of 4 separate monosynths.  Though 4 voices is the total polyphony, it's also 4 voice multitimbral and can have a differently programmed monosynthfor each multitimbral voice<br />- You can daisy-chain 2 (or more) of these things together to use like one synth and increase the polyphony<br />- Dual-voltage power supply (not a big thing for most, but I've split equal time as an adult between Europe and the states and am very grateful for it)<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- No easy knob-tweaking satisfaction here.  I have a Yamaha CS-5 (old one-oscillator monosynth) and an Arturia Minibrute, and I love tweaking and programming these things in real time, having no problems that there's no storage for patches/sounds.  Hands on tweaking is the fun, and in comparison what this product offers is MUCH more limited without diving into menus<br />- Minus the computer and software, programming this thing is a HUGE pain in the butt (though still doable) and I would think, a big detractor for the voltage-controlled, analog-loving crowd<br />- No keyboard.  Yeah I know a keyboard would kill the whole small footprint advantage, but I still find myself wishing for one occasionally<br />- No onboard effects (reverb, delay, chorus, etc)<br />- If you're not picky about the whole analog/digital debate, you can pick up MUCH more polyphony and similar sound-producing capability and effects for MUCH less money (Roland GAIA SH-01, Novation MiniNova, Casio XW-P1, etc)<br />- Almost forgot...the unit has no power switch.  Plug in to turn on, unplug to turn off<br /><br />And that's about it.  Wish it had more voices and knobs, but that's just being greedy because again, 4 analog voices for this price is quite nice.  Great sound and easy programmability (for my setup anyway) make this a no-brainer, 5-star purchase...for me anyway.
