I use this in some smaller venues chained through 12\\" mains and powered by a Peavey PV5300. The specs are 75 Watts RMS and 150 Watts peak at 8 Ohms. Crossover is 4KHz with frequency response in the 75-18KHz range. The unit itself is 18\\" long by about 12\\" deep at the deepest part. It has a 1/4\\" input and passthrough, and a carrying handle. It also has a pole mount that I have never found necessary.<br /><br />For venues of up to 100 folks and some lighter music like Chicago-style blues these are more than sufficient. Of course you are not going to use these at a Metal gig. The clarity exceeded my expectations, but is going to sound tinny of you expect to run heavy bass frequencies through it. It's ideal as a vocal monitor and, perhaps, sufficient if you are also mic'ing amps or running their output into your PA via XLR outs. Don't expect miracles in that scenario.<br /><br />I love these because they are lightweight and do not take up much stare (or playing area) real estate. They are reasonably well constructed and will hold up to lighter gigging schedules if they are properly carried and stowed. If tossed around I am sure they would not last a month. Since I take care of my gear they have held up for the two years that I have owned mine and will probably last a lot longer.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are looking for inexpensive - but decent - monitors for small venues this one may just fit your needs. I'm pleased with mine.
