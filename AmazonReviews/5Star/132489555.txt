Great for my son. He has been using the same stand for years now. I like how it folds up so when I have to dismantle it for a performance for him, even I can do it! Very sturdy too. He ended up using just one cymbal on it since it has good movement for splash. It can be used for two cymbals but seemed too close for his liking. However; I have seen it stacked before.
