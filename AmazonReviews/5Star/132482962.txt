I wanted an extension cable so I can connect my headphones to a source directly so I can watch movies and play games without bothering anyone else. I bought another extension cable by Maxwell which didn't work but this one worked flawlessly and without sacrificing the sound quality. it sounds same as I have connected my headphones to the source directly. so if you need extension for your headphones look no further.
