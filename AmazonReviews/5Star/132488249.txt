For home use, this amp is simply unreal. If you think ISF is a gimmick, you just don't know. This will not be my last Blackstar amplifier, I am coveting everything from an HT5R to an HT40. Sure, you can save a few bucks on that Bugera, but Class A doesn't hold a candle to \\"push - pull\\" design. This amp really does sound like a full-on Marshall, Mesa, whatever. Genius idea and execution from Blackstar.
