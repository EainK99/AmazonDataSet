First of all it came to us perfectly tuned.  If anyone has ever tried to tune a kalimba themselves then they know how incredibly important that is.  The tone of this little lovely is a quite enchanting the sound box is more than adequate for the resonating notes to be heard even in a room full of children.  Playing this is a simple slice of music heaven and for the price, I don't think you could get another thumb piano/kalimba that is even half as good.
