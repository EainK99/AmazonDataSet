Any Zelda fan will truly adore this. It is more costly than some others, but well worth the extra cash; it's durable, eye catching and comes with a booklet with a lot of the Zelda tunes/songs that you can learn to play. So not only can it be used for cosplay, but also for photography and just general fun.
