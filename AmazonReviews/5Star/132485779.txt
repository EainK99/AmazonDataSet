I got these to light up an Burning Man art installation at night, I got them because it was DC current and so I could attach them to a battery. I ended up hooking it up to a battery pack over a deep cell for cost reasons, using a pack and some wiring help from my local EL-wire distributer. worked great for my need! sticky backing wasnt necessarily what i needed, used some zip-ties to secure it in the desert.
