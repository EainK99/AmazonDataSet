I'm using one PR-12 as the center channel speaker on my home theater system. Compared to most of the similarly priced &#34;bar shaped&#34; center channel speakers, the sound of the PR-12 is clear, open, and dynamic. Voices are very natural and realistic sounding, and dialogue is easy to understand. It's extremely efficient, so my receiver's amp is more than adequate to pump out lease-breaking sound levels. The bass can sound a bit &#34;tubby&#34; when playing music at loud levels, but this is at levels where most traditional center channel speakers would be badly distorting.<br /><br />I needed to buy a cable with a 1/4&#34; mono phono plug on one end and bare wire on the other for speaker wire, which my local Radio Shack stocked.<br /><br />Needless to say, this speaker won't fit inside most TV cabinets, and can't be tucked in front of the TV like most center channel speakers. My cabinet happens to be relatively tall, so I was able to just squeeze the speaker in once I removed most of the cabinet's shelves, which were just collecting dust anyway. The PR-12's black grille and dark-gray cabinet don't stand out, so it looks surprisingly at home inside the cabinet.<br /><br />Overall, a great speaker, made in the USA, for a very reasonable price.
