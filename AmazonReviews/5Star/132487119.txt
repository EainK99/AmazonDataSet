Very simple and basic, but an enjoyable story with profound principles. As a christian, i think an often unspoken but real message is that &#34;spiritual&#34; or church work is an higher calling, but this book contends that both the marketplace and the work of spiritual leaders/teachers are equally &#34;holy&#34;.
