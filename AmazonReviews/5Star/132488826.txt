This is undoubtedly one of the most clean and accurate mixers I have ever used since 1998 when I started scratching. vs. Vestax, Rane, Pioneer, Stanton, Behringer,Gemini, LOL Radio Shack.  I bought it to replace my vestax pmc 06 which is smooth and accurate, but has a lot of noise in the fader. A friend has the same vestax 06 with an Innofader upgrade, but it still pops when cutting because of the vestax analog design. So I've been looking for a mixer that I can record my scratches with without spending the totally outrageous prices the other companies are charging. It needs to be very clean sound, and cut fast without delay. The dj tech does!<br /><br />I am relieved to have found this mixer. Thanks dj tech for putting out a product that scratch heads can use. This isnt for djs who want bpm counters, flashing lights, and transform buttons. It is what all of the turntablists wanted before midi cues were important. Its a clean face without a bunch of unnecessary bs, and a hamster switch with curve on the clean, smooth, accurate crossfader. For 90% of scratching this is enough.<br /><br />Since there aren't many out there yet for people to try before buying the fader is very similar to the Rane in smoothness and fader cap design and feels just as sturdy. But I think this fader cuts faster and more accurate than the Rane or Pioneer. There is a worthwhile youtube video of short-e dif-1s vs Rane where she does a side by side.<br /><br />I bought with a free next day shipping promo and got it less than 12 hours after ordering freaking awesome. $2500.00 mixers can stay on the shelf. And the guy who gave the negative review works for radio shack  don't believe this troll.
