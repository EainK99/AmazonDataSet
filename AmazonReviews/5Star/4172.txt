i've only just gotten the machine unpacked and setup,  I've printed out the manual, and attempted to use the karaoke in a basic way without having the slightest idea what i was doing...i had NO TROUBLE DOING THIS, meaning the basics are not very difficult to use and, without much knowledge, you can grab the microphone and have a fun hour or two! I'm guessing, though, that if you spend a bit of time learning the controls you'll have a blast!  sound quality is excellent...
