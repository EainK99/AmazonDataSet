This is by far the best usb microphone in it's price range.  It is very well built, aesthetically pleasing, easy to set up.  I mainly bought this for casual gaming and some recording.  I have owned this mic for about two months now and could only find one con to its performance.  That is the mic is very sensitive.  It will pick up hard desk vibrations, (which I'm sure can be fixed with a boom our mat) and distant sounds easily.  But, it is possible to reduce this in recording settings.<br />I recommend this mic for any casual gamer or streamer searching for a mic on a budget.
