One word - AWESOME! Just check out the YouTube videos if you don't believe me. 4 wire with bare ground so go ahead and series/split/parallel this puppy if you are looking for that option.  Works fine in neck or middle. This is, of course, is intended to replace a single coil to get rid of the dreaded 60hz headache. It will look a little silly in a regular humbucker slot . Works and is schematic'ed with 250k pots,(check this out too on their website). I have a 500k tone pot and it works fine. If you don't like the sound this makes then you don't need a humbucker or spring for those active EMG's \\"metalheads\\". Have fun changing those batteries. What are you doing with a single coil pickup anyway?<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />Nashville Tele:<br />Neck - SD Hot for Tele Rhythm<br />Mid -  SD Lil' 59<br />Brg -  SD Hotrails
