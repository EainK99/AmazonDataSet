My long search for the perfect guitar miniamp may be nearly at an end. It has volume, tone and gain dials and a two-position fat switch. I have never played the Vox train stack but the headphone version has all I need for those quieter moments.  The clean setting sounds warm on my Fralin PAFs and my Fender72 reissue.  With the gain up, the clean setting gives me the bluesy sound I hoped for.  With fat switch on very little gain produces a nice smokey sound. The best thing is I don't have to crank up my Super Reverb to concert strength and use a pedal.  It beats out my PocketRocket, my Fender mini and my Danelectro mini.
