For the price I paid you can't find anything that can beat this deal. These guitars are well QC'd at the factory. Fit and finish excellent. Tone and volume controls work through the full range of motion. Rosewood of high quality with very tight grain. Only negative, and it's only slight, is that the HB pickup is a little on the weak side. Others have commented on this as well.
