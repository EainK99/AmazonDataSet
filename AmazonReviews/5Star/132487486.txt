This piano has such a sweet sound, and it feels like a real piano, something I was concerned about earlier.  It wasn't very hard to put together, and although two black keys weren't working when I got it, the seller told me to wiggle them, that they were just \\"out of their sockets,\\" and they snapped into place.  I love playing it and couldn't be happier.
