Bought this to be used at a fraternal organization as a speaker system.  The unit is small and easy to move around.  I thought it was going to be too weak due to the small size but was pleasantly surprised - it packs enough power to be used in a large hall.  Being wireless is also a plus to avoid long cords.  So, all over a very good product.
