Modded mine to have a switched external speaker jack to drive a pair of 4x12 cabinets.  I also have the one with a built in tuner and digital fx, and they are not the same preamp circuit.  This one has a clean volume and then gain/mastervolume and both channels share the same eq, which is fine.  The clean tone is great, close enough to my '69 Traynor Custom Reverb and '99 Fender Prosonic.  The gain with a strat is clean up until about halfway and then it comes on fast.  Basically, this amp reminds me of my buddy's OR50 except not quite as huge sounding but pretty damn close.  You could totally gig with this, or at the very least use it as a backup.  I'll be getting the footswitch soon.
