I recently purchased a Remo Mondo 12' djembe. This case fit it perfectly and features a pocket which is useful for putting drum key/earplugs inside. Also, the shoulder strap makes it easier to walk with the djembe if transporting it. Just be cautious that when putting the djembe back, the case wants to fold in and requires some effort to put it back inside the case.
