It's a great gig bag for the price, it fits my Hola! HM-121ZW+ Deluxe Soprano Ukulele perfectly. There is a lot of padding to protect your Uke and no seams are coming unstitched yet that I can see. It seems to be made from good quality, durable materials. There is a zipped pocket on the front of the bag that holds my Snark tuner and an extra set of strings just fine. Nice bag for the money!
