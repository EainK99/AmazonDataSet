Had mine a little over a year I think this is a terrific value for money, reasonably priced instrument. Tone is great, the stock strings good, nicely built. Clearly this is not a &#34;toy&#34; uke.  If you are expecting it to have the finish, feel and sound of a $1000 instrument, you'll clearly be disappointed, but for an instrument that will play better than you can through the intermediate level and look great with a traditional finish too... you can't go wrong here.
