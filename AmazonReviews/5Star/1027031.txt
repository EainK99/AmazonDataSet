This has got to be the biggest, baddest pedalboard ever made.  The case is extremely heavy (and heavy-duty) with padding and side storage, and the pedalboard is made of powder-coated black metal.  It's very strong and the slatted construction allows for easy access to cabling, power supply, and battery compartments.<br /><br />If you're in the market for a very large, heavy duty board with an equally heavy duty case, then this is it.  All others are inferior.
