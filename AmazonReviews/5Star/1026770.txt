I've only used this Universal Pop Filter for vocal recordings so far. It works extremely well to prevent the louder &#34;pops&#34; when the narrator says &#34;p&#34;s and &#34;b&#34;s. It looks cool when attached to my Blue Snowball microphone. The coil allows for easy positioning. As the curved design is bulkier than flat pop filters, plan ahead to have enough room in your bag if you're using it as a portable. Makes smooth recordings and looks great. Recommended.
