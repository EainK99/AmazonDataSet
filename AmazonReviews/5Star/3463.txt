One of the very best &#34;clip on&#34; tuners I have found.  Easily catches the lower tones - sometimes a problem with other tuners.  I bought two of these, I was so impressed with the first one I had been given as a gift.  I have used these on acoustic and electric guitars, mandolins and banjos and even clipped to the bell of my trumpet.  Excellent size and performance.  DECIDEDLY worth the price.  You can easily set it to automatically detect your tones, or manually select your tuning note - an excellent feature considering its sensitivity.  Finally, you can adjust the central tuning to A=440 or adjust the central tuning up or down from that reference pitch.  Again, most useful.
