This is my second purchase of this item as I purchased another several years ago to hold a mic for audio work in creating my own CD's. Now that I am moving on to podcasts, it was only natural I purchased a second for guests on my programs. The base is solid which holds the mic in place without concern for it tipping over or moving around.. It is easy to adjust the height to a level that is comfortable for you, and attaching a holder for the mic itself has been made fairly easy. I highly recommend it for someone just starting out as it has stood the test of time for my uses and is still reasonably priced.
