I've just picked up my second pair of the HP500s and thought I'd write a review as I loved the first pair so much!<br /><br />Although these cans are a bit bass heavy, I find that it is helpful for when you are DJing. My first pair lasted me about 1.5-2 years, with the left headphone eventually failing. It may seem like it faded quickly, but I had them going almost non-stop for the entire time I had them! Very clear sound.<br /><br />Traveling around for gigs, in and out of bags, humid clubs, and sweaty ears meant that they didn't see the most pampered life, but I loved every minute using them up until they failed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
