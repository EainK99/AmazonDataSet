I can't stop playing this guitar. I made the mistake of buying a cheap Olympia acoustic for my very first acoustic and consequently I always played my electric instead of my acoustic. With this one, I can't help but play it everyday. The action is great and comparable to higher priced guitars. The built-in tuner works wonderfully. The sound out of this thing is outstanding. Another point that I find important is that it's just a beautiful guitar to look at from every angle. I've had it for a good month now and I feel no need at all to upgrade. Granted, I bought it used for an unbelievable price but after playing it for awhile, I would not regret paying full price for it.
