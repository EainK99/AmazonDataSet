This Silver Creek Classical Guitar Case is a perfect fit for a vintage Yamaha G85-A classical guitar that I recently snagged on eBay.  It's a perfectly snug fit all around, so if you've got a guitar having measurements greater than those of a G85-A you'll likely need to pick a different version of the case. (See the G85-A dimensions below.)  The case is form-fitting and appears to be solidly constructed, with a good handle and reliable-looking latches. (Six latches total, one having a lock. Two keys were included.)  I very much like the retro styling. I liked less the &#34;new guitar case&#34; scent of glue and synthetic materials, but it had probably been tightly closed and boxed since it left the factory and the scent is already fading. (To provide some reference point on that, I'm a lot more annoyed by such things than most people.)  All in all, I'd call it a very good case for the price.<br /><br />The dimensions of the Yamaha G85-A are as follows: lower bout (the widest part of the body) 14.5 inches; waist, 9.5 inches; upper bout, 11 inches; depth (including the bridge thickness) 4.5 inches; length, 39.5 inches.<br /><br />The seller of the case was Music 123.
