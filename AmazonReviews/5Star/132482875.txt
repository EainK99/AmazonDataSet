These are also available in red.  Avoid the red one's, because unlike these, the red one's do not have a texture to keep them from slipping out of your grip.  These are also available as \\"regular\\" size and not XL series.  These XL series are the size of a typical pick.  The non XL series are TINY!  Avoid them. (they're great quality picks, just too small)  If you play metal, rock, blues, jazz, and need new picks, go with Dunlop Jazz III XL Stiffo Guitar Picks 6-pack.  Make sure they're black, and XL!
