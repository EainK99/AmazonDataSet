I am a bit picky : )  I can't tell you how many variations of guitar and factory installed pickup I tried at various music stores. Eventually based on reviews and experience  I ended up buying and installing this in my new Guild D-55 and LOVE it!  When I play through a PA System, I think \\"that sounds like my guitar.\\"  If you like your axe, what more could you ask for?
