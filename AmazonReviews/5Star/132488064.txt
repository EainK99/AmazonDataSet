These cost about double the standard strings in equivalent gauges, but they play exceptionally well and sound great.<br /><br />I tried them out after reading reviews from several artists who stated that they feel broken in out of the bag and I agree.  Bends and vibrato seem easier to me with these as they don't feel stiff like many new strings do.<br /><br />The tone lasts for a long time, but they do gum up with the finger grunge and become slightly discolored after a moderate amount of playing.  A quick wipe with lemon oil or guitar polish will clear up the grunge and the sound remains nice and full longer than others despite being darker where you play a lot.<br /><br />If you don't like having to play for a week or two to get that broken in feeling, these are great and the tone is warm and full for a long time.  I keep mine on for about twice as long as the standards, so the extra cost works itself out without as many string changes.
