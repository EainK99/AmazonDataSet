The Snark SN-8 tuner is inexpensive on Amazon, clamps easily onto the head w/o fear of marring the finish of my expensive instruments.<br />The tuner reacts very quickly to the string vibration and the display is easy to interpret for accurate  tuning.<br />The battery is long life and is turned off in 2 minutes if you forget to turn it off.
