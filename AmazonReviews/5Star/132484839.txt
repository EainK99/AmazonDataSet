Check out my YouTube channel (user rkaos1987) for some Pink Floyd, Beatles, etc. that I've recorded with this mic. My most recent covers used the mic, unlike my older camcorder videos. Anyway, here's some tips. The AGC setting on your mic setup on the computer: (go to control panel, manage audio devices, recording).....also adjust level / volume there too. AGC unchecked (off) makes it more clear, BUT even on 100%, volume is barely enough. Decent, but low. Recently, I use AGC checked (on) but you need to drop volume down to 50% - 60&#34;. Adjust it based on using guitar pick, or just your fingers. I sing about a foot from the mic, with a cheap pop filter attached, and I bought a cheap foam mic cover. Play your acoustic while you sing, and with your laptop, a cheap but decent recording studio!!
