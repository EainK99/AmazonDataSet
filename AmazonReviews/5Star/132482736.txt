I started playing on an old crappy acoustic guitar that had a huge gap between the strings and fret board. I had to press so hard to get the sound I wanted. After buying this I was astonished at how much easier it was to move around the fret board. The sound is great even from the small amp it comes with. The amp even has a headphone jack to play silently. Everything in this pack is made from quality materials, nothing feels cheap. The finish on the guitar is excellent, and the rosewood fret board is beautiful. It looks and sounds great. If your a beginner looking to step up to a better guitar, this is it. I'm glad I got it.
