Previously I used the STAX SR-Lambda electrostatic headphones. These headphones are incredible. I recall freaking out the first time I tried them because I thought someone dropped something in the room behind me when I was alone. After closer inspection, it turned out to be the sound of someone dropping their purse during the recording in a concert hall (presumably behind the microphone). Even though I had heard this recording many times before, I had never notice that sound and with the STAX it sounded like I was right there. These headphones eventually developed a random crackling noise and needed to be replaced.<br /><br />I tried the AKG K702 headphones and was happily surprised. First they are large enough for my full grown male head, they fit snugly and the cushions are sufficient to actually isolate my ears. They are a tad less comfortable for hours of listening compared to the STAX, but more comfortable than any others I've tried.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent. Everything is well defined and accurate. Perhaps another reviewer is right and the drivers need a little time to settle in, they are noticeably less precise compared to the STAX right out of the box. Also the energy to drive them is increased compared to some lower end headphones. Plugging them into the same source I need to turn up the volume to get the same amount of sound compared to Sony headphones. Once the volume is up the AKG sound better, however it is worth noting. These headphones deserve some amplification.<br /><br />Bottom line, out of the box the AKG are in the same class as the STAX and one of the best headphones I've ever experienced. Considering the STAX retail for around $1400 and the AKG are $250ish with shipping, this is my new top choice for price / performance and they may even get a little better with time.
