Most clip-on mikes don't have the low-end frequency response to handle the nice crunchy low notes on a trombone or bass trombone, but THIS one does.  Easy to use, with a firm clip that doesn't damage my bell;  used double-sided velcro tape to strap the XLR adapter to the horn, up near the counterweight.  The only (temporary) glitch was getting the sound guy to switch on phantom power, and flatten the frequency response on my channel.  Since this mike sits much closer to the bell, he can set my levels lower, eliminating feedback WITHOUT him lowering the individual frequency bands that might feed back in a given room.  Flat frequency response equals a better, more natural sound.  AND it's nice not being locked into a fixed position for an entire gig, just to maintain ideal mike positioning;  you can finally move around without fear of bonking the mike stand with your slide...
