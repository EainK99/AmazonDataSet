I'm a working musician, my drummer pulled one of these out at a gig and I was in love! We use a cajon already and it was the perfect accompaniment to our little arsenal of percussion toys. I also have little kids at home that always love to play with my instruments. For fifty bucks I feel like this is a good quality percussive instrument and not so expensive that I'll let the kids bang on it. IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE BRUSH AND DRUMSTICK LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWS. *repeat* IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE BRUSH AND DRUMSTICK LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWS. I never thought it would, but I did notice a lot of reviewers were upset by that. Buy your own set of sticks (we've played with pencils and chopsticks and it works!) It allows you to tighten the drum to achieve the sound you want. I am NOT a drummer but I sure love playing on this thing! It's a regular in my gig bag now and the bag it comes with has a really cool strap and handle. Definitely get this! It's fun, it's great for kids and great for musicians!
