I am a beginning adult cello student and know very little yet. I initially purchased a different brand of rosin but found it hard to use, so I purchased this one because of the reviews. What a difference!  The rosin is easier to use, my bow sounds better, and my teacher approves. She says that this rosin is usually purchased by people who have far more experience than I do, but she's glad, that like my cello, I purchased one of the best. I think unless I drop and break this rosin, it will last for quite some time. I am very pleased with the purchase of this rosin, and even my inexperienced ears can tell that a better rosin makes for better playing.
