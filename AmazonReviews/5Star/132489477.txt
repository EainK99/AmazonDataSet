I use one of these together with pointer and middle fingerpicks for playing my Irish bouzouki.  The combination allows me to switch from strumming to Travis/Scruggs picking mid-song without breaking stride.  For the hardest strumming while wearing the fingerpicks, I brace the Herco with my ring finger and pinky, while holding my pointer and middle finger out of the way in a peace sign &#34;V&#34;, but for gentler strumming, the thumb alone is fine.
