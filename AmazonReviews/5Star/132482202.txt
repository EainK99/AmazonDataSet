I ordered this trumpet for my daughter who is in marching band.  The trumpet arrived just in time for a competition and she could not wait to use it.  Not sure if the sound was &#34;right&#34; she gave the trumpet to section leader, who collects trumpets and has been playing for years.....his response &#34;this is a really good trumpet, nice job&#34;.  This compliment made my daughter more confident in her ability to play in front of the judges and the smile on her face is beaming.<br /><br />I had not issues with the shipment or timing of the trumpet's arrival.  I would definitely recommend this trumpet and seller for fast shipment and quality of product.
