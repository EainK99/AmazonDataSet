Wow, these are the most comfortable over-the-ear headphones I've ever worn.  Have these plugged into a mixer board to monitor recording of both music and spoken word.  Audio performance is just as good, or better, than the AKG K240s they replaced.  Based on comfort, performance and cost I think these are the best headphone deal going.  Last, but certainly not least, the packaging is brilliant.  Flip open 3 tabs and the package easily separates - NO welded plastic clamshell that you have to cut apart.
