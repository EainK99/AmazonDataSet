Edit; 5 years later and these poor cans are a little worse for wear but they still sound just as good as the day I bought them.  Pros:  Comfortable:  I wear these things 8-10 hours per day with very little discomfort. Durable: They take their fair share of abuse.  They get knocked around, banged on the desk, stretched, twisted and yanked off my head.  They perform as flawlessly after a year of wear and tear as they did the day they were delivered.  Noise: Excellent noise cancelling properties.  No outside ambient noise and very little leakage if worn properly.  Cons:  EQ: They are bass-boosted.  Not the best choice for production work but they make for awesome studio and live broadcast monitors.  Power: at 250ohms, these cans require serious gain to run properly.  You will need to purchase a head amp with quality pre-amps.
