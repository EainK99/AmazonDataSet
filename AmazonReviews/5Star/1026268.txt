Ok I just got this bass 2 days ago... The bass is pretty light, and have an amazing tone quality and pickups for the price. The neck felt fine not too wide, BUT the body it self of the guitar felt cheap,  but overall it sounds and looks inedible for the price you pay it's still a good buy at the list price in my opinion. Only thing I would change is a case included but that's no big deal. Would buy again... yah know, if I wanted to buy the same bass again lol
