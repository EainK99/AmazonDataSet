This package is easily assembled and put into action. I have a Digital Piano that fits nicely on the stand and the bench works perfectly and is comfortable. not very &#34;deluxe&#34; but for someone that has basic needs for a keyboard stand and bench this item is a great deal for the money. I have a Casio Product and it works very well with this particular stand and bench combo and I am comfortable with the configuration enough to play for hours. I would certainly buy this again or recommend to a friend.
