Bought this as something to pass the time with. Solid price and great construction for the price range. I'm not particularly well-versed in musical equipment or music in general, but there did seem to be a break in period with the Shark before it was humming and holding its tune longer and longer. Since I play more as an idle hobby/time occupier, I couldn't tell you how long the alleged break-in period was, but one day I found myself playing longer and longer and my chords sounded the same as when I started.<br /><br />Aesthetically pleasing with its flat, pastel green and having a full sound (when you get your own fingers sorted,) this is a fun musical instrument to have and to learn from/of. Definitely recommended.
