Its a Levy's made in Canada heavy-duty cotton strap. I expect to get years of great use out it. Built to last and comfortable for even my heaviest of basses. Basic black color, don't need anything else and nothing else is available anyway. Its perfect, they know and you know it as soon as you open it and put it on! Best price on the internet and super fast free shipping. 'Nuff said! Grab one!
