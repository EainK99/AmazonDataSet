Super happy with this bag. As advertised it fits my zoom very well. Enough extra space and storage for power supply and midi/guitar/usb cables.<br /> I was a bit worried about the padding after reading a few other reviews. This bag is perfect for storage and light transport.  The padding is fine for typical bumps and bangs. If your gear is going to be tossed around invest in a solid case.
