I am so glad I bought this lav! I wasn't sure how well it would work because I read other reviews that there was a buzz, but I decided to buy it anyway because it had to be better than the cheap wireless mic I already had.<br /><br />I shot an outside wedding ceremony last weekend and the Smartlav worked so well!!! It was under the groom's tie and sounded way better than any of the other audio I recorded on an external sound recorder (I had it for back up incase the Smartlav didn't perform). It picked up the bride and the officiant without a problem and there was no wind noise at all. I'm not sure if that was due to being under the tie or not. Either way I am extremely happy with the Smartlav and I totally recommend it!
