exactly what I needed. easy to set up. the only thing is you need a 3 inch or so lip on the desk or counter to attach. Luckily I wanted it on a counter so I added a block of wood and painted to match the counter. it also allowed me to put 2 screws in the holder o the countertop to secure.<br /><br />But great for me
