I got these to put on a Jackson Kelly I wanted to reserve for death metal. Going straight into a circuit, there is a lot of signal loss. If going through a volume and tone, make to use nothing higher than 250K. I actually bypassed the circuit with the bridge pickup, going straight into the output. I don't need a volume control. Volume controls aren't very metal \m/<br /><br />With the sutep I have, these pups really scream.
