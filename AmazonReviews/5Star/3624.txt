Works very well, and produces a beautiful, sweet sound.  I recommend it.  Makes practicing easy on the ear.  It's amazing how loud the violin is.  Some have complained about the smell.  I don't mind it, and I am usually sensitive to smells.  It does have a rubbery smell, but only when held up to the nose.  Don't really smell it when plying.
