I got these to replace some klipsch heasphones.  I only purchased the klipsch initially, because at the time Ultrasone didn't have an affordable pair of earbuds.  Your probably asking yourself, why should I pay 200+ for a pair of headphones?  If you have to ask, don't...just stick with your skullcandy's, or your iphone's.  The foam tips work outstanding for keeping these in your ears, a dealbreaker on earbuds for me.  Outstanding sound quality, durable housing, and cord, mic feature so you can answer your phone and not miss a beat.  Great product, period.  I recommend.
