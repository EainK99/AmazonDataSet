I have a hobby/gaming related podcast called War Council on Itunes (yeah, me and everybody else out there, right?).  In the past I'd been using a gaming headset and Skype as a vehicle for recording our podcast, but I was displeased with the quality of the audio recording and wanted to up my game.  I was looking for a relatively inexpensive microphone since I wanted multiple co-hosts and guests on the show and would need to facilitate up to four mics at a time.  This microphone met all my basic needs on paper (pop filter, XLR plug, etc) and was REALLY inexpensive.  I was pleasantly surprised at the audio quality on these mics.  Our recordings are clear, the audio is crisp, and the price can't be beat.  Don't believe me?  Find War Council on Itunes, episode 11 and beyond and hear for yourself.  You've got to hear it to believe it.
