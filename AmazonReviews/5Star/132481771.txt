I finally got this gizmo wired up correctly; put it as the last item in your signal chain. I use the amps effects loop to my pedals (send) and then lastly through the 362 before going back (return) into the amp. As others have stated it is like removing a blanket from your speaker, it really tweaks the final sound for you. My wife has put up with my guitar playing/jamming for 3 decades. Most of the time it's \\"Turn it down\\" or \\"Close the door\\" you guys know what I'm saying here! But the first time I got this wired up per above, she said \\"You have some really good tones coming out of your office\\". Needless to say I was floored, she didn't know I was using the 362 so it was a totally unsolicited comment, and it honestly did make a difference in the tone! Now there are lots of things in your signal chain that all add up; your guitar properly set up and your playing abilities, the pedals and settings, the amplifier with good tubes and the perfect bias tone, so it's not just one thing-it's the sum of all things for great tone. But honestly, this device does work if you wire it in correctly. I understand the 362 is no longer manufactured but newer models and pedals are out there and must do the same thing to your tone. If you have been on the eternal tone quest as I have, try it, you just might like it!
