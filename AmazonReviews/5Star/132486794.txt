They have worked great for practicing on anything when you don't have a practice pad, and lasted me a really long time before the tip broke off. Buying a new pair right away! Totally worth it. They're also fun for drumming on many random objects for the sound it creates, like trash cans, bottles, chairs, etc. My band director and I did a drum solo on trash cans that was pretty sick with em'. I would totally recommend these.
