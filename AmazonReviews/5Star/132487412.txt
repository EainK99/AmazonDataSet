I've only owned this stand for a couple months so I'm not sure about the lifespan on this product. It has been with me at shows every weekend, no problems at all. I was honestly surprised at how sturdy and well put together this stand is. The plastic piece that locks the neck is legit and it won't fall over lol I don't know what else you want in a stand. I'm going to buy a violin and mandolin stand from them next and see how that goes.
