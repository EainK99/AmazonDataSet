What I like most about this item is the sound of it for any guitar without having to dig and drill into the wood of a guitar to install a tremolo unit and it works great with guitars that never had a whammy bar to begin with and it has digital readouts not just leds like the digitech whammy and you can use it to record as well as play live with too!!!
