I've had 2 of these both great for $,<br />Indo-made but fender does a good as anything else they have on them.<br />Things of note are screw less tuning machines which are nice but tough to upgrade to schaller or whatnot as two pin screwless high end run 40-100$ and not all pins line up perfect, so kinda just live with good quality, rather than best.<br />Alnico magnet pups, these are great at this $.<br />Classic strat sound, staggered pole (especially left stagger) like these hard to find.<br />1 I got had full size pots 500k which I like of course but other had dime size 500k as don't know why they differed... Maybe some plan to save a nickel each... But the 500k with .47 cap electronics are both nice and bright with these pups. The tremelo has real deal saddles two point mount and pretty well done, little spongy to get used to pivots easy, both had two tension springs rather than 3... I added 1 more but no real difference, just watch resting your hand there, overall keeps good tune and has graphite nut, one of the few strat copies out there that isn't really lacking something? The body has h-s-s routing, both mine do anyhow, case you want that bucker later... But I wouldn't, it's got those little pinch harmonic sounds I like, that twangy grit thing... Good solid weight, feels like alder don't know if it is but you'd think so, great fit finish, nice smooth rosewood board classic maple neck needs a couple years though to age into the classic look, it's kinda new white-ish out of box. But it ages well.
