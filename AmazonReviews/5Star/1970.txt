A friend of mines gave me these for my birthday, and I have been using them ever since. The sound quality is super good, as I can get really good bass with balanced mids and highs. These particular earbuds sound a lot better compared to others in their price range. The build quality is okay, as there is some cheap plastic being used, but its only a $20 set. The wires are strong, so you dont need to worry about breaking the wire when you remove the earbuds from your phone.
