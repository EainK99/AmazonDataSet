This harmonica has everything you would want in a harmonica, including detailed instructions about how to customise it for new tones with different plates (?!?!). I'm a beginner harmonica player, so I'll be watching videos on how to play this thing, but I like the sound so far, and am impressed that it's so well-labelled on the box with the key, which in my case is F# (to match the key my band plays in). For some reason, there are hardly any harmonicas available in the many otherwise well-stocked music shops of the city I live in, Singapore (some don't carry any at all!!), and certainly none in F#!! I was very happy to be able to find this online, and that it delivers to Singapore, which is not always the case.
