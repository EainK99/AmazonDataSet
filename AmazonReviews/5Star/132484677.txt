I highly endorse this product I do not want my guitar valued at many thousands of dollars to inadvertantly hit the deck. I had previously purchased a similar but different brand strap lock set that failed within five minutes of installation That was very scary. My guitar survived without a scratch but I returned that item and bought the family name brand....
