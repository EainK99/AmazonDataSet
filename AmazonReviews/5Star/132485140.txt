I bought this to record scratch tracks from my acoustic guitar.  I Love LOVE LOVE this mic.  I've since moved on to a Fishman Spectrum Di for acoustic but the Rode NT5 is great for horns (which is what I currently use it for).  You can use it for overheads though I haven't tried it.  It's just very versatile.
