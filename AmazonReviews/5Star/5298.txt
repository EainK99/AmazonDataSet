Nice value. Getting it to sound may take a more experienced flute player.  Fingerings are somewhat similar to a regular concert flute.  Flats and sharps are rather airy and some hard to do. More consistently in tune than homemade six-hole flute. Overall excellent for this price. Excellent sound for C Major scale stuff.  Excellent gift for my flute lover.
