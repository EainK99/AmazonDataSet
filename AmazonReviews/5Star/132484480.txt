I use this stand during jazz gigs, and it works great for all model trumpets, including flugel horns. It's very sturdy, and well built. It also compacts easily to fit into most cases, which is a plus. I'd recommend this product to any trumpeter who uses more than one trumpet in a song/concert. Works great!
