These cables are worth every penny. They are durable, flexible, and the tips are top notch. They look great too. I have a '59 Les Paul reissue and they match very well. I would recommend these cables to anyone who doesn't want to deal with tangled cables that unscrew constantly, one less thing to worry about when all you want to do is plug in and play.
