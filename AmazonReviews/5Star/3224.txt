Some things need to be tweaked out of the box. The arm lubed and moved to make the joints &#34;breath&#34; and some screws tightened. But nothing that a screw driver and wd40 can't handle. Otherwise I highly reccomend this as a beginner arm. I use it for podcasting. I did buy a aftermarket pop filter and shock mount that works perfect with this.
