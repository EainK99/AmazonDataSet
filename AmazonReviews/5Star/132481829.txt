Love this thing. I own many a guitar and a 5 string banjo. Playing in my 'Country Club' band, I was looking to add some twang and still solo out like I would with my guitar. Standard banjos are great, but something about being a guitarist initially and switching over, there were some things I couldn't do. This was a great buy for the money, the quality and the fact that it has opened so many doors to new possibilities. The action was a bit high for my taste, but still played great out of the box. I've adjusted the saddle slightly for my own personal preference and now my only worry is that my other instruments may collect some dust, cause I started laying this thing and have a hard time putting it down! Awesome buy, get you some Hoss!!
