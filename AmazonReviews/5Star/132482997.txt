You get the quality of the iRig Pro plus the ability to plug in Lo-Z mics AND use phantom power if needed AND it does MIDI. You get all the cables needed to connect to a computer as well as all versions of the iPad and iPhone. You also get some free software when you register and not the limited functionality free versions. The unit is well made and a no-brainer to use.<br /><br />I already had the iRig HD, but was looking for something that would let me MIDI a keyboard to use the keyboard apps in my iPad. This works perfectly. It's very portable.
