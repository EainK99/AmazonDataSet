This case was exactly what I was looking for. I had previously ordered a different case from a 'reptile' brand that I had once trusted before buying this one and was so disappointed, that I had my doubts about how worthy this one would turn out to be. This SBK 335 case is money. Solid, minimum height shell (closer to the depth of a LP case than an acoustic), tight fit on the lower curves of a 60's Univox Coily, which is what I got this for. If I had one, I'd throw a vintage Gibson under a plane in this case no questions asked. Fits a Bigsby equipped instrument perfect. Don't skimp on a few bucks or trip on the obnoxious sized buckles, this is the case for a 335 type.
