I haven't really begun to really master this mixcraft stuff nor the mic (due to a full house) but with the little time I got working around this stuff, IT'S GREAT! Amazing mic, amazing system. My friend was messing around and actually made a couple of cool beats and what not. When we finally figured the recording stuff out, our voices actually sounded pretty accurate and crisp. I'm more than satisfied with the product so far. Nothing bad to say about it. The only thing I had 2 complain about was that after a few tries, Mixcraft stopped opening. Like it would load then freeze. & I was stuck for a while in-till I realized by clicking on it multiple times like a schizophrenic, one or two would open out of eight frozen ones lol. After a while I realized a few projects were saved on there and opening them rather than opening a new one, would open it fine. I really didn't know if it was my laptops fault or not  (its a cheap $350 one afterall), so i held back on attacking Acoustica. Besides that little scuffle, Mixcraft rocks my pathetic world. If I ever get more privacy, I plan on rocking this software to the MAX! Also, Acoustica constantly sends deals to your e-mail about their other products at a lower price on occasion. An example being that I was sent a $50 to $60 off, for the upgrade to Mixcraft Pro Studio 6. As well, as their instrument ones & whatnot. I got much love for Acoustica. Great buy, great deals, great product, nothing else I can say. Don't get frustrated with this product. Look up tutorials on the website, as well as by other youtubers about this product and you'll get the hang of it. Trust me.
