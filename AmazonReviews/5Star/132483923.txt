this set if perfect for the kids, it is very light weight, the drum practice pad and bell set switch out very easily.<br />The sound is not bad, the drum sticks are a little heavy for my daughter liking but I have other ones she likes.<br />Easy to set up and holds up to my daughters moving it around.
