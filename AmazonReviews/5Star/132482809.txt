For the price listed, this is really good quality musical instrument for your preschooler. This is the perfect size for a kid between ages 3-6.<br /><br />When I first got it, I thought the strings would not last for more than a week but to my surprise, they are still intact even after it's been used very roughly for the past 3+ weeks.<br /><br />The body is also made of quality material - it does not look cheap. But I'm guessing that it will get dents and scratches over time. I will update this review after some months to report how long-lasting this is.<br /><br />For now, this is really a good value for the listed price ($25).
