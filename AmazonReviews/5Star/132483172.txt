I love everything about this Luna Nylon String guitar.... except for the cheapo gig bag which I won't use anyway.  This is a nylon string guitar but I will compare it to similar size steel string guitars. I have had many Taylor Baby's as well as the Taylor Big Baby.  I still have a Martin LX which I use occasionally. There is no doubt that the Taylor Baby is the best one of the bunch in this size guitar. But I will say that this Luna Safari is a very very close second in many ways.  The first thing that I did when I received the Safari was change out the nylon strings to D'Addario extra hard tension strings.  I always like to start a new guitar with new strings and the hard tension strings take up a little of the slop for a small scale guitar. The quality of the Safari is pretty good with no extra glue or dings, or bad finish anywhere.  The tuners are basic and only adequate, but do hold well.  Intonation is near spot one but not quite as good as my previous Baby Taylors.  The Safari sounds near identical to the Baby Taylor and in my case much better than the Martin XL model.  If I would have to come up with some downside to the Safari Nylon guitar (Cons).... I guess I would say that I am not crazy about the oversized fret markers and the very cheap nut and saddle. As previously stated the Gig Bag is a near joke with no protection what so ever. But I never buy a guitar based on it's gig bag or case anyway.  Other than that I am well pleased with this guitar. So in conclusion my opinion is:  Based on the Safari guitar that I received I am totally happy and especially for the price. This is a sweet nylon string guitar that looks and plays very similar to some of the Taylors and Martins. If you are looking for a small size dreadnought with nylon strings this could be the one for you. And one more thing... My fingers love nylon strings.
