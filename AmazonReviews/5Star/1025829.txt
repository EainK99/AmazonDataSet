Bought this for my wife. This violin took only minutes to assemble. You really don't have to have it set up professionally if you do your research and educated yourself. It isn't that big of a deal. Search Youtube as they have many good related videos. This violin looks very nice and has a nice finish. The strings are cheap and basic but these need replaced anyways as time goes by. I can see no defects or major issues in the finish. My wife's music teacher plays professionally and she agrees it is a great value for any beginner to learn with. It sounds great also, very crisp and has good tone. Iv'e heard it side by side with more expensive violins and it is comparative. It is a great buy and we have no regrets.
