These microphone/ear buds are specifically designed for Roland's R-05 studio recorder. In that context, they are outstanding. There is a setting in the R-05 menu for \\"powered microphones\\" this must be activated. My guess is that these are \\"condenser-type\\" microphones and therefore need an external power source. This goes a long way in explaining how such a small microphone can sound so good. The fidelity of recording and playback is phenomenal. The true functionally of this system is best realized when you are using them to walk around picking up sounds as you would normally hear them. I recorded the sounds of a walk around a lake, the system picked-up the lapping of waves, the flutter whirligigs, the distant cry of loons, the banter of people kayaking out on the water, all in such natural timber and dynamics it was like being there again. I recorded the sounds of a violent thunder storm, the crash of ocean waves against the rocks, the cry of loons up close (50'), horses trotting etc. Each time the capture and reproduction was true and uncanny accurate.
