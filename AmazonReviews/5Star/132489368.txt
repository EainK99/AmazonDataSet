The Korg TM50BK instrument tuner and metronome is very simple and compact. I slip it into my pocket when I go to orchestra rehearsal or performance and have the ability to tune my viola quickly and accurately. And other members say, &#34;Hey, give me a Bflat&#34; or &#34;Give me an F&#34;. I gave this tool five stars because I have only had it for a couple of weeks and from now on, I will have it with me or close to me when I'm doing any musical activities, whether it be vocal or instrumental. Thanks Amazon and Korg; I found exactly what I was looking for.
