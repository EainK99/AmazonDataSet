I've had my Korg M3 in this case since I received it a few months ago.  There's some scratches and dings in the case, but my M3 remains in perfect condition.  The wheels work great and will hopefully live a long time, the handles seem to be very strong and sturdy, and the latches work well, easily, and hold tight.  It's exactly what I needed in a keyboard case.  I'm thinking about buying one for my smaller 48 key keyboard.
