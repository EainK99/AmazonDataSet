These headphones are great. I bought them for my dad for his birthday, as his cheap but good Koss on-ear headphones were broken. He plays in a rock band, and they record albums, so he used these cans to listen to the various versions of produced tracks that they recorded. He loves them. For the price that I got them for, about 50 bucks, they're insane. A guy I know has the [[ASIN:B000ULAP4U Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones with Coiled Cable]], and I honestly can't tell much difference between them (although I've only used the M50s a few times, and by listening to them side by side, I could probably tell some differences). If you're hesitating to buy them, just do it. You'll absolutely love them, as my dad and I surely have for the few months he's had them.
