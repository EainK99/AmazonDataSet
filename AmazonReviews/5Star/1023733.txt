I was very happy with this product.  Used it to line the cavities of my RG 270 and I had plenty left.  Sticks very well and not an issue applying.  Separates from the backing easily and once pressed into place doesn't move at all.  Only thing I would have done differently on this project would have been to use a small roller to press into place.... Like a small wallpaper roller.
