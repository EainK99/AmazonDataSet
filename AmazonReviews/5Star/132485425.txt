I felt like a child on Christmas when this kit arrived. The case came in excellent condition, beautiful inside and out. The guitar itself took my breath away. I loved the rich mahogany color and high gloss sheen. The inlay around the opening is gorgeous as well.<br /><br />After about 5 minutes of tuning, it was ready to play. I had been playing a Jasmine S35, and was pleasantly surprised at how well this Fender plays. Each note has creates a sweet, resonating sound.<br /><br />I was expecting to get the Fender 80/20 light strings, instead it came with Martin SP 80/20 light strings. No complaints, I prefer the Martin's anyway.<br /><br />The one thing I did not particularly care for was the tuner. I was previously using a Snark tuner. It was easy to use, it told you what note you were playing and if it was sharp or flat on one simple screen. The tuner included with this kit does the same, but there are three lights; flat, note, sharp. When the note is on key, the lights turn green. When it is either flat or sharp the lights are red. I just prefer the simplicity of the Snark model.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. A great deal. I would recommend this kit to my family and friends.
