These pins fit perfectly in my Cort Mini Earth, and I can say that there was a noticeable change in the sound of my guitar, which in my personal taste was an improvement (in my opinion the quality of the sound in a musical instrument is subject to the personal taste of the musician).<br /><br />The Mini Earth is a 3/4 mini Dreadnought, with solid spruce top with laminated mahogany back and sides. The solid spruce top gives the guitar a bright sound that is emphasized by the plastic pins. With brass pins the guitar produces more bass and middle frequencies - in subjective words, the sound gets fuller, darker, and more balanced, which in my taste is an improvement in the sound of my guitar. Plus, with these pins my guitar looks great, and if the pins get stained I can always polish them.<br /><br />In my opinion, if you prefer an emphasis in the treble frequencies you can try pins made of other material. But give these pins a try! because they're of great quality. You are not wasting any money here. If you decide they are not the proper ones for your tone, you can always save them for experimentation, or recording sessions, where to have options is a must. In any case, remember that to get that &#34;tone&#34; that you're looking for you have to try not just pins, but strings, saddles, and even guitars of different shapes, sizes, and of different woods.<br /><br />Anyways, I do love my new Pickboy brass pins, and I highly recommend them =).
