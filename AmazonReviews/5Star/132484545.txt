First off, let me start by saying that I'm not violin professional or even player in the slightest. I love to play the piano, and violin has always seemed to me as the great partner to the piano, in terms of popularity, music capacity, and power. I decided I would teach myself the skill of violin, but without breaking the bank. I decided on this one for reasons that I can't quite remember. I think it was because it was the cheapest that looked nice visually. Ordered it w/ the protection plan.<br /><br />I was currently on a trial of Prime, so I received my package in two days. It ships in a very large box, maybe 6 inches deep, and four by five feet. The case is within the box, I think with some wrapping if I remember correctly. The case is a high quality case, if nothing else, you have a decent case to sell off. It has backpack like straps that are very useful, and also has an exterior pocket, though I don't put things in there. The violin also comes with a informational book from The Instrument Store, about set up, names of parts, very basic information.<br /><br />The Violin itself was covered by a protective cloth in the case, a nice feature to have. It is a carbon copy of the image on this site, which is nice in that you know what you're getting, but disheartening in that you know you're getting factory work (It is only $50). It looks beautiful, if nothing else. The bridge was a little crooked, though it was set up. I had to straighten it a smidge. The strings are not tight, but do hold the bridge on. Be careful the first time you tune it. Don't go too fast, or you will break the strings. They are new, and they are not the highest quality. I snapped the G (low) string the first time I tuned it, and was without bass for a week. I recommend buying [[ASIN:B00460AIY8 ViolinSmart 4/4 Violin Strings Set]] just to have on hand with your violin. As to the tuners, I have found that they hold quite well, and are well fitted. The violin holds a tune for a very long time once you have broken it in after the first initial weeks.<br /><br />The bow is the weakness of the package. It is brand new, so you will need rosin. This does come with some, but I had to stop in at a local music store to get some higher quality rosin. Remember what you're paying here. Make sure you score the rosin (google it), this gives the best. Rosin is required to create friction between the strings and the hair; not using it makes an awful sound, comparable to a dying feline. The bow is not of supreme quality, but, it is a bow.<br /><br />I decided to teach myself the violin, so I opted for a book to accompany this. My band course in High School uses the Essential Elements series, so I decided to go with that as well. [[ASIN:0634038176 Essential Elements 2000 for Strings: Book 1 with CD-ROM (Violin)]] makes a great companion to any self teaching player. I also bought a shoulder rest, [[ASIN:B002QJVTNA Everest EZ Series Shoulder Rest for 4/4 Violin]]. Shoulder rests are not necessary, it's more of a personal playing preference as to how you want to use it. Many do, many do not.<br /><br />All in all, this is a phenomenal product for the price that one pays. I have already decided to upgrade to a rental violin and donate this to my HS band program. This instrument has the power to rekindle the flames of any musical passion, as long as that passion is matched with dedication. I highly recommend this to beginners only.
