This MPC is a complete turnaround for me  Having played a Dukoff D8 for over 30 years in small groups, I needed something that would blend better with a big band sax section, and I found it!<br /><br />The sound of the V16 is big, yet controlled. It produces a full, vibrant but not brassy, tenor sound. It is easily controlled top to bottom, and for me the most important part: it plays in tune!  I'm able to match tone and pitch in all registers, yet sing through on solos when the time comes.<br /><br />I'm also using the same MPC on alto which makes switching very easy - something I do in two bands. I'm considering getting one next for bari.
