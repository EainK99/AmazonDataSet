Excellent!Well worth the money! Works great for the band! We've used it both mounted on the stand and when we gig at local bars we mount it with the floor mounts pointed towards us. Combine this with the 4play and it's an amazing little dance party set up as well. Add fog/haze for an even more exciting light show.
