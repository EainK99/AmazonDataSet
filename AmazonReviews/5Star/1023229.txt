I purchased this case to store my Zoom R8 digital recorder. Oddly, Zoom doesn't make a case for their own recorder so I started looking online and found this Studiocase model.<br /><br />It's well designed and works perfectly for this application--the R8 fits nicely in the pluck-and-pull foam insert and there is enough room to fit the Zoom's power supply and a Zoom FS01 footswitch on the side. It's wide enough and deep enough to really protect the recorder. The outer case shell is medium weight, not as heavy as, say, a Pelican Case, but plenty strong for this application and I'm guessing it's maybe 1/3 to 1/2 lighter than a Pelican case of this size. (I use a lot of Pelican Cases for camera equipment and, while they are super-strong, they can get a little heavy. And expensive!)<br /><br />It's nice to have something like this case to protect the recorder and it makes it easy to grab it and go when you're on the road. Very good product at a good price, highly recommended if you have a Zoom or similar device to protect.<br /><br />I was also impressed with DistroTech's customer service. Very nice people to do business with--the got the order out quickly and followed up to make sure I was happy with the case. Super-impressive considering this was an inexpensive item! Thanks.
