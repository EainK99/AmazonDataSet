The product arrived in 2 days with amazon prime in excellent condition. It had all the bonus items (bench, headphones, dust cover and starter pack) specified. This is great price for the piano and bonus items. Guitar Center sells the same item (just piano) for $799 + tax. But there was no tax and free shipping for this item. So you can't beat this price. I am very satisfied with the purchase and highly recommend.<br /><br />No comments on the piano since I am just beginner but it does look, sound and feel great.
