This ukulele exceeded my expectations!The description says it all, Not sacrificing quality for price! My sensibility of sound is developing still so I might replace the strings soon but like any string instrument, just play it non stop for a couple of days and the strings stay in tune. I highly recommend this as a first it backup to anybody
