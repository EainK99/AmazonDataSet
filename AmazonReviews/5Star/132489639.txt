I am a guitar/sax player but I like to play percussion instruments to set up rhythms for new songs that I write.  I have a traditional cajon but it can be hard on the back after a while.  This Slap top cajon solves that by sitting comfortably on your lap and giving you a nice range of tone to create some nice percussion sets.<br /><br />I bought a set of cajon brushes that only enhance the usefulness of the instrument, really like the instrument and I keep it next to my couch and pick it up when the mode grabs me, nice way to forget your woes and get into some cool rhythms that tend to get your head straight.<br /><br />It is made well, solid as a rock without being heavy and looks real nice, the burl is nicely done.
