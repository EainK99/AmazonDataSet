I love these headphones. I use them at work to help drown out the noise of people around me when I need to get some actual work done. Before buying these I've never owned headphones that didn't just come with the iPod. This is a world of difference.<br /><br />They aren't &#34;noise canceling&#34; headphones, except that they're well built, solid, closed headphones, so they naturally block out ambient sound. Even fairly quiet music masks the conversations around me to the point that I can focus. The other side of the &#34;closed&#34; headphone point means that I'm not bugging other people with my music. Unless you're listening to music at ear-damaging levels these headphones don't &#34;leak&#34; sound.<br /><br />I've read here that some people have problems with the band being too snug, but I haven't had any problems, and I have a larger than normal head.<br /><br />The title is the greatest acclaim I can give these, though. I've had them on my desk at work, in use almost daily. I've taken them on airplanes, and they still look, feel, and sound as good as they did the day I opened the package. I can't see any signs of plastic cracking or bending, no cracks in the ear pads or headband, everything is still solid and sound. I really can't recommend these highly enough. The only bad thing I can say is that you probably don't want to wear them while running.
