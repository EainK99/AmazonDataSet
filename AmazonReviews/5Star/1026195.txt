Very good quality case for your standard size Acoustic guitar. The lock is a little low quality but it serves it's purpose. The ribbon that allows the case to stay open as pictured without going all the way over, on mine , it's shorter than it should be, so mine doesn't remain upright but that's easily solved with some black shoelaces!!! If you want a hardshell case but don't want to fork out over a hundred bucks for one, this is definitely a life saver for the guitarist on a budget. The interior has a slight odor from the soft material and glue used to hold it in place, but nothing so bad that a little airing out won't take care of.  There is a compartment with a hinged lid for storing whatever you want like capos, cleaning supplies, tuner, straps, short cord if you play an electric acoustic. Has great neck support, contours nicely to the dreadnought shape and cutaway dreadnoughts. Packaging is very secure and handled nicely, except for the box is fairly large. Comes complete with 2 keys!!! Buy with confidence!!!!
