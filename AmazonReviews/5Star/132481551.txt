I own this pedal...perfect match for my AC15 -and- AC30....It is a dual ON/OFF switch for Reverb and Tremolo...built solid with nice LEDs. I don't know why the sellers on Amazon are asking such INSANELY HIGH prices? You can buy this pedal BRAND NEW at any music shop or online retailer in the USA for about $39.99...that is BRAND NEW...Great pedal, BUY ELSEWHERE!!!
