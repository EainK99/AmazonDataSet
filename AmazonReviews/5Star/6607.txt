When I started playing piano in 2007, my parents bought me this portable grand. Eight years later, I still use it, and the only thing &#34;wrong&#34; with it is that occasionally half the screen will stop working temporarily. I love this thing, and I plan on using it throughout (hopefully) a professional career. There are actually too many good things to say about it. If you are thinking about buying it, do so. You will not regret it.
