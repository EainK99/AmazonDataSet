This thing is a dream come true for anyone looking to build a home networking lab. Currently mine is holding up 3 routers, a power supply, and 3 switches. No problem at all for it. The only thing worth noting is that if you have a large switch (long from front to back) you will not be able to rack this on the bottom slot, because of the racks slant. but for the money you cant go wrong.
