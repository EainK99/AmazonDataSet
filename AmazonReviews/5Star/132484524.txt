Well, Ive been playing for almost 10 years,its been almost a year since i bought this strat<br />all I can say is: this is a real classic strat<br /><br />the body is really well done, nice tinted neck, cool bell-sounding pickups<br /><br />the cons:<br />-it has a LOT of treble sound (i play it trough a peavey bass amp, and is still bright)<br /> so, if all you have is a yiny tin-can sound amp... it may sound \\"bad\\" but it's NOT a flaw, you just got to find the right equalization...<br />- the pickard looks \\"cheap\\"<br />-the tremolo bar is the thin one, you may want to replace it if you're going to use the tremolo frecuently<br /><br />pros<br />-flawless finish<br />-done out of 2 or 3 (mine's 2) pieces of wood, you can see it thru the tinted body<br />-super rounded body (at least more than the lower end squiers)<br />-nice sounding pickups (very little noise)<br />-tinted neck (i love them, not everybody does... there arent to many strats with it, so for me its a plus  ),<br />with medium jumbo frets (no sharp edges)<br />-around 7 oz (not quite as heavy as a LP)<br /><br />STRAT SOUND! yeah, all the sound of a classy strat, it wont sound like a LP or a tele or a JM... just a strat :D
