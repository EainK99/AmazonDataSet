I needed to get a couple of small rack boxes that could use to mount various rack units for mixing and recording, and got 2 of these. These work great because they also double as a mixer table due to their height. I have both of these sitting side by side, with rack units and power supplies mounted inside, and my hard disk recorder and mixers sitting on top. They are sturdy, and the carpeting is nice. There's no wheels on the bottom, so they don't roll, they may or may not be a good thing depending on what you need to use them for, but I don't move these around, so I like that they don't have wheels.
