At the recommendation of a former guitar teacher, I installed the medium weight version of these strings on my Epiphone DR 500 MCE acoustic/electric guitar.  I tried for 6 weeks to become accustomed to those strings and they just weren't working.  Too much pain that produced no real gain!  Today, I installed these light weight strings and the guitar is again playable.  The sound level is probably 95% of the mediums.  The clarity seems better.  What impresses me is how quickly these tuned up and stayed in tune.  As always, Amazon handling of my order was prompt.
