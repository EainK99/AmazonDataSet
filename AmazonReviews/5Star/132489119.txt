You don't have to be a Eddie wannabe to love this humbucker.  That being said, it does nail that tone from early VH.  It's got grit on the low end and singing harmonics on the top end. It's very high powered but also responsive to pick attack. I didn't expect good clean tones but it's very warm.  High gain is where it shines.  Using the red channel of a 5150 mark 3, it crushes.  So much power and clarity, it's amazing.  On the blue, that old Van Halen 1 sound in spades. It's like they captured Eddie's magic in a pickup.<br /><br />I usually use Seymour Duncan JB's but now I'll be switching.  I think Seymour Duncan actually makes this for EVH, but it isn't a run of the mill production item you've used before.<br /><br />You can use this pickup for blues, metal, classic rock or anything else, it's that good. I was skeptical of spending so much on one pickup (most humbuckers are about half the price) but now I'm a believer. I'll be buying at least a couple of more!
