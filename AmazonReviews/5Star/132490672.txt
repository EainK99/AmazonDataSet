Borrowed this mic from work, because I had a short-term need to record some quick voice-overs. I had some technical issues that I would like to share so others do not have to go through the same hassle. After fixing these, the mic worked great. This was on a Windows 7 desktop.<br /><br />1. Where the USB  cord plugs into the back of the mic, it can easily be inserted upside down. The red light on the mic will still light, but Windows will bring up an error trying to find the driver. Look closely at the socket, it goes in just as easily upside down as the right way.<br /><br />2. After overcoming this, the mic sounded horrible. I looked in Control Panel > Sound > Recording, and the Blue Mic was indeed the default device. I decided to try disabled the other two devices that showed on this screen, and then it worked great. Not sure why, but it worked.<br /><br />Happy recording!
