Been using this pedal for about a year now and hasn't failed me yet....clear tone and nice wahs is what you get out of this pedal...has 3 different wah sounds which all are very different and can be switched easily with a 3 way selector switch on the side...very easy to use and operate...would recommend this pedal to anyone who plays guitar
