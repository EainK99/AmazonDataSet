didn't got this by amazon.<br /><br />very good quality build, nice looks, great sound.  good bluetooth performance on same room.<br />saw bad reviews about bluetooth performance, so far for me in a big room, no problem, not for walking around the house.<br /><br />pros:  build, looks, sound level, sound quality<br />downs: no remote<br /><br />i would recommend it to anyone.
