Works just great on my Blue Yeti. I play a lot of games over skype calls with my friends and they can usually hear my breathing and the sound of the fan in the background. This filter helps decrease the access noise that hits the mic and also is easy to set up. Just a matter of loosening and tightening a screw with your fingers.
