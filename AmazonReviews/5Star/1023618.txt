Got this for my daughter, she loves it, we take it in the car, she puts it in her forts, she treats the thing like a binkey or something.  Its good and bright, nice to have 2 settings and nice to have to power options (AC and DC via batteries)  Another reason I got this one is it takes AA not AAA batteries, gives it that much more light time when on batteries.
