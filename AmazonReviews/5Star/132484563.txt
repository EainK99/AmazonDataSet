I ordered this for a friend's birthday and so far I love it.  I hooked it up in my bedroom to check it out and it lit up the floor, ceiling and bed with little squares of rotating colored light.  It has a sound motion setting, but the lights kind of flicker rather than constantly be illuminated, so I am wondering if that is how it is supposed to function.  However, when I flip the switch to on, the party is in full swing.  It is battery operated, it rotates and the LED's are in different colors.  I think I would have preferred white LED's, but overall am completely happy with this product.
