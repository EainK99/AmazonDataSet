This germicide spray is an absolutely great find! I have bought both used and new mouthpieces and nowadays it makes sense to be on the safe side and disinfect something you will put in your mouth.<br />I was worried it might damage my ebonite mouthpieces but it didn't so it is very gentle.<br />I can only recommend this product!
