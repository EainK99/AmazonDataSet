I had heard that these strings sounded good, but some people have had trouble with breakage with them. I put a set of these on my tenor uke and they sounded great. I'm very happy with them and after a month have had no problems with them breaking. They feel a little rough texture wise, but I got used to that pretty quickly. I put them on an acacia koa uke, which had always sounded a little muted, but now it has a very loud, bright and crisp tone. These strings really made my uke come alive. I like them so much I ordered a standard tuning set for my other uke.
