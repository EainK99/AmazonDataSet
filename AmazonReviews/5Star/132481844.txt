Let me start by stating that I have returned this trumpet.<br /><br />I played trumpet in high school and my kid for the first time just started band and wanted to be a trumpet player as well.  Not wanting to pay the unreal expensive school rental fees, I turned to Amazon and we ended up getting him a $119 blue trumpet that looks and sounds great!  Should carry him through Jr. high with no problems at all.<br /><br />So I got the idea that I'd relive my high school days and practice with him.  Enter this trumpet.  I did not take away any stars because I do not want to unfairly damage this company, but there was absolutely ZERO difference between this $300 trumpet and my kid's $120 trumpet with the exception of the weight.  This trumpet was slightly lighter as I'm sure the materials are different, but that is it.  Playing a C note together, the two trumpets were perfectly in pitch.<br /><br />Also, the different color variations to me just made it look dirty.  Silver here and there, rose and brass was just too much.<br /><br />None of the trumpets on Amazon under this $300 mark are anything near a professional quality, but I don't see this trumpet lasting any less time than the cheaper versions.  Just my opinion.
