It's cotton so it breathes and the dye stays put. The leather is supple yet strong and the buckle won't scratch your finish, I've got no problem hanging a heavy $1000 guitar by it. It's the typical strap length and I prefer it to nylon models.<br /><br />It's a unique strap for a unique thinking musician. I own almost 50 straps and I can recommend this one.
