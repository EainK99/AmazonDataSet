As mentioned by others, it isn't easy to get this on the Yeti, but with careful tugging around the edges I had it on in a couple of minutes. I did a test recording before and after of ambient sound. I have an air conditioner vent in the room that makes a constant background noise. The windscreen cut down on that sound by a tiny amount which is good. Since this is a windscreen and not a background-noise-eradicator, I didn't expect it to do any more than than. I also did a before and after test for plosives and it cut down on that a fair bit. I've paired it with a pop filter and they work well together.
