Let me just begin by saying that I'm in college, so I didn't have a ton of extra money to spend on a guitar. Also, this is my second guitar. My first guitar was a $120 Jasmine by Takamine NEX s34c cutaway, so compared to that, this $300 Fender is a great upgrade. I didn't buy my Fender from Amazon - I actually bought it at Guitar Center after taking my old Jasmine in for some adjustments (it was buzzing every time I played, which was driving me absolutely nuts) and realizing that the Jasmine wasn't worth fixing. After trying a couple Yahamas, this Fender as well as one other Fender, a Mitchell, and a Luna - all within the $200-350 range - I decided that I liked this Fender the best.<br /><br />Why? Well, first of all, it's gorgeous. Also, it feels like a really solid guitar, which makes it really comfortable to play, and it sounds great. Even though it has a slight cutaway, this Fender sounds more like a dreadnought to me, but maybe that's just because my Jasmine didn't project sound very well. The sound of this Fender is definitely deeper than my Jasmine's bright tone, which I love. Overall, this little Fender is a great guitar for a beginning or intermediate guitarist who has started learning guitar, decided to keep playing, and wants a guitar in the $250-300 price range to continue their journey as a guitarist. That's what I did, after all: I got the cheap Jasmine, used it to learn all the basic chords and a couple easy songs, took guitar classes at my college for a year, decided to stick with guitar, and upgraded to this Fender when the Jasmine started having truss rod problems.<br /><br />So, get this guitar if you wanna keep playing. And enjoy the journey.
