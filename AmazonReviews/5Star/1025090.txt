I have an Epiphone LP Custom that was having issues somewhere along the line.  Spent many hours trying to find it and fix it.  It was so much easier to just replace everything with this complete harness.  The only small issue is the connector from the three-position switch.  Won't fit down the tunnel - so I just unsoldered the connections, ran the wires up through and resoldered to the switch.  Hooked up the connector, soldered the pickups and WooHoo!!! Perfect. Exactly what I needed.
