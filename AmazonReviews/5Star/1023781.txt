I don't use this for a violin, but for cleaning a soldering iron tip. This is a very inexpensive way to get a block of the stuff. Rosin is tree sap, and contains abietic acid and other organic acids. It's used for cleaning the surface oxide from metal for electronic soldering, so that the molten solder can wet the metal. The acids in rosin are only corrosive when heated to melting, not at room temperature. So, the rosin residue can in general be left on the circuit after use without long-term corrosive effects. Plumbing solder using other forms of acid (which is called &#34;acid-core&#34; to distinguish it from rosin-core solder even though rosin is an acid too) remains corrosive at room temperature and must never be used on electronics.<br /><br />Rosin is generally held to be safe but does have some medical effect in testing (interestingly, it inhibits a molecule that breaks down testosterone) so be sure your work area is well ventilated.
