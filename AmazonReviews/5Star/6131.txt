Wish I had purchased this sooner.  The sound quality is excellent and this system can be used in many ways.  I use it twice a week for a class where I have to speak over very loud music.  My voice cuts right through the music and is very clear over the loudness.  It also works great as an interviewing system in conjunction with a DSLR.  It comes equipped with an accessory attachment to place on the flash hot shoe.  There are two adapters that come with this system that attache to the receiver's output: one is an XLR the other is a 1/8&#34; stereo jack that can be plugged directly into the microphone input of the camera.  Alternatively the XLR jack can be plugged into an outboard recorder that is equipped with XLR inputs.  These two coiled cords are provided in the package.  I use the coiled XLR cord for my class b/c my microphone input is an XLR (female) plug.  I am very pleased with the battery life, of both the sender and the receiver.  The receiver however has a much shorter battery  life, which is understandable b/c it had double duty of receiving amplifying and outputting.  I use rechargeable batteries so this is not an issue.  I recharge after each use.  If you think you can use a system like this, I recommend that you go ahead and do it.  You will not be disappointed with the performance long after you've forgotten the price.
