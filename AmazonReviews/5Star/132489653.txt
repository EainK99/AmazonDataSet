I can not say enough good things about this light. It absolutely is the single best purchase I made and for the money it makes very good sense. If you used 2 of these lights you could certainly get away from buying much more. The lights run very wild and unpredictable which makes them a blast when listening to all types of music. The light need to be mounted fairly high to get the best results, maybe starting at around 10 feet off the floor.
