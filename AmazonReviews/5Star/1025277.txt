i wanted to change out the cream tips on a couple of my SGs with black tips. The first tip I purchased was not a Gibson part and did not fit ( it might have worked on a Epiphone). It was a smaller diameter & threads didn't work.. Since then I have bought 2 of these Gibson tips and they are perfect. Buy Gibson for your Gibson!
