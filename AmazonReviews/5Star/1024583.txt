These are the only patch cables I'll use on my pedal boards. Between my guitar board and my bass one, I have easily purchased five three-packs of them over the years, and may need even more soon.<br /><br />I used to use a random assortment of whatever no-name cables I had acquired through the years, but after having a single cable fail somewhere in the middle of a twelve-pedal pedal board and having to take the whole thing apart to test which one had gone bad, I decided to throw out all the questionable ones and switch to a single brand. These have never let me down since!
