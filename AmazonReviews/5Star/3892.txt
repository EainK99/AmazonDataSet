You get what you pay for, and this is worth the money. This is a good first timer harmonica for adult beginners or children. If you already know you are going to take harmonica seriously I would get something better though. I had notharmonica experience before I bought this. I did not want to spend a lot in case I lost interest. This harmonica wore out on me in 2 weeks of very heavy usage. Since I have purchased the Blues Harp Special 20 a more expensive model I noticed this entry level Honer was out of tune on the 7-10. It was also harder to play and bend but to be honest I think it was a good move because when I got the more premium harmonica I could play it so much easier, I would have wanted a great harmonica to start with, this made me better because it was more challenging to play. It really made me get my breathing worked out. Overall a good value but serious players will want to step up rather quickly.
