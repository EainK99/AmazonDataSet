Very good quality pads. the front sticker looks a little cheap and one of mine came a little crooked but this is only cosmetic and has nothing to do with the actual product quality.<br /><br />I used it to decouple my speakers from the desk they sit in and worked great.<br /><br />A nice addition is the fact that the pads are sliced in a way that you can adjust the foam to tilt the speakers
