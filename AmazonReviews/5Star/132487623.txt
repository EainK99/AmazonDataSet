Some say this folder is not big enough. Let me start off by saying that there is a bigger version of this folder...... therefore if you stress that this folder too small, instead of leaving a bad review on a product that doesn't deserve such criticism, please go ahead and pick that one up.<br />Having that said, this folder deserves 5 starts in every category.<br /><br />Built: leather material, professional looking, sleek, slim.<br /><br />Storage: I have around 30 pages of printed music on the left pocket and 5 music scores (etudes/Pieces) on the right pocket. This folder fits them all and keeps the entire folder looking slim.<br /><br />Security: There are two rubber straps on the side, which will secures the folder to its maximum safety. You do not have to worry about your music being folded or slip out of the folder. Even when the folder is at its thickest point, the straps which is made of rubber, will stretch its tension to protect the music by securely tightening the folder.<br /><br />I'm a freelancer clarinetist and this folder fits perfectly into a backpack and my instrument case without any hassle. 100% satisfaction guaranteed!! :)
