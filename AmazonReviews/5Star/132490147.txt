Can't tell you how darn awesome this thing is!!  Made doing a wedding (DJ) so much easier and the thing folds up to hide behind my dj table, out of the way.  Took two trips from the truck instead of 5 (using a hand cart).  Highly recommend this to anyone that brings equipment to gigs- bands, djs, performers.. holds like 500+ lbs, and the wheels are very quiet and can handle bumps and hills.  I ordered the expandable platform for the bottom, and I just ordered the top shelf as well.  Amazing, tough, handy, and awesome!
