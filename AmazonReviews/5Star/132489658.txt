If pro recording artists trade in their racks for the simplicity of the StompBox Compressor...thats good enough for me!!!<br /><br />Compact design with enormus properties, LED work well even with passive bass...if you cant get your LEDs to light up on a PBass your pickus suck...Ive played with many passisves and as you begin to upgrade and the pick ups gain in quality the LEDs follow.<br /><br />If your looking for a Bass Compressor, stop wasting time and money, buy this pedal...shure your can go boutique and drop +$500 but i have yet to hear any boutique that can outdo the MXR M87<br /><br />Keep makin em MXR...I'll keep buyin em
