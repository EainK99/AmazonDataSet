With my years of experience in audio, I have to say that these monitors have much more value than their price. This product will not disappoint and will provide a very positive listening experience for both audio engineers and music lovers.  I am very happy with this purchase. I do recommend going for the CR4's instead of the CR3's. These will be good monitors for you if you want to record music, play games, or watch movies on your computer. Note that you will need either an AUX adapter or an audio interface of some sort in order to use these.
