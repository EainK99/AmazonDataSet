I gave this 5 stars because of the amazing value.  Here, in the early part of the 21st century, you can buy a decent microphone for under $30.  Where were these things 40 years ago when I began recording?!  This thing is no match for a high quality, and high priced, microphone but for $30 it's a great starter mic.  Its status as a starter mic may be the reason that some people are confused about the need for phantom power to turn on the electronics in this microphone.<br /><br />Phantom power is 48 volts DC applied to pins 2 and 3 of the microphone's 3 pin XLR  output connector.  Pin 1 is the ground.  It's called phantom power because it is applied to the audio wires in the microphone cable but, if the associated equipment is working properly, it is invisible to the audio circuits.  This is a very simplified explanation but it is correct.  The phantom power is needed to polarize the condenser and to turn on the microphone's internal electronics.  I think most of the confusion about this microphone's need for phantom power is caused by the fact that this mic is shipped with a cable which has an XLR connector on one end, for the mic, and an 1/8&#34; tip/ring/sleeve mini plug on the other end.  I've been a professional recording engineer for 40 years and I can tell you that phantom power is not usually supplied through a mini plug.  It can be done but it's not common.  This means you'll have to buy a regular microphone cable which has XLR connectors on both ends.  It also means you can't plug it directly into your video camera or any other device which can't supply phantom power.  Where does one find phantom power?  On virtually any audio mixer or computer audio interface which has a microphone input.<br /><br />If you've been doing the math, you're realizing that the cost of owning and using this microphone has been going up.  A microphone cable will cost around $20, a minimal mixer can be had for around $50, and computer audio interfaces start around $90.  If it's any consolation, almost every good microphone needs a proper cable and either a mixer or audio interface in order to work properly.  This mic, a cable, and a mixer can be purchased for around $100.  40 years ago, the mic and mixer couldn't be had for under $500 so cheer up.  Get this mic connected properly and it will delivery good results and very good value.<br /><br />You may be wondering why a veteran recording engineer with 70 microphones in his collection would purchase an entry level mic.  I bought it with the intention of opening it up. removing and discarding the electronics, and replacing them with high quality components from an on line company which sells microphone parts.  If you have the technical skills, and don't care about losing the warranty, this mic is a prime candidate for modification.  Parts which will fit in an MXL 2001 will fit in this mic, too.  However, do not attempt to modify this or any other microphone unless you know what you're doing!!<br /><br />I hope I've cleared up the confusion about phantom power.
