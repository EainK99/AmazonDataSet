I put this head on my PDP Platinum kit that I bought used.  It had an Aquarian Studio-X that I wasn't too happy with, so I thought I'd try an Emad2.  I've used an Emad originally on my Pearl Session Custom 22&#34; kick and it sounded great, but let me tell you....when I slapped this head on the 24&#34; kick, I was in heaven.  This head brought a nice fat attack and had a nice &#34;wet&#34; sound, which I prefer for a kick drum.  It was a world of a difference from the studio-x it had on it.  I ended up using the thinner of the two rings it comes with.
