I had purchased this a while back, and didnt get a chance to write a review-- but I must say its a great violin for a starter like myself and its really helped me advance in the classes. It's unlike my first violin that didn't sound as good. Having the extra strings is great- even though I havent had the need to use them yet and the instructer was pleased with the bow's construction compared to my first violins. I absolutely love it and will always treasure it as my officially first violin :) &#60;3
