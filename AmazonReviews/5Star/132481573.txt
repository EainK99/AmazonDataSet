I ordered this stand because I needed it for my Dean ML which would not have fit quite correctly (I believe) on the GS414B or GS415B thanks to the fact that on those models the body of the guitar rests on the two legs at the bottom of the stand.  With the GS412B the back of the body rests on the T-bar attached to the main arm of the stand.  The headstock fits nicely into the foam headstock holder and the automatic arms pop up perfectly to keep the guitar secure.  The T-bar is easily adjustable thanks to the automatic locking feature it has.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about this stand is that, although it works perfectly as intended, it would be nice if it could be extended to be just a bit taller.  My Dean is about 48 inches long in total, and 40 inches from the very end of the body to the nut, which is where the stand actually holds the guitar.  Now, compared to my Ibanez RG, which is 39 inches long total and 31 inches from the very end of the body to the nut, the Dean is clearly a much longer guitar.  I'm glad that it isn't any longer than it is though, because at the tallest setting this stand holds my Dean only about an inch and a half from the ground.  So while I'm sure this is basically the best option for an oddly shaped guitar like Deans, Warlocks, Gibson Vs, there's still a chance it may not work for you depending on how long your guitar is from the nut to the end of the body.  Also, this stand works on the assumption that your headstock is cut symmetrically on both sides like the default Dean headstock as opposed to a Fender Tele, ESP, or Jackson.  Don't even think of trying to put a Parker Fly in this thing.<br /><br />Anyway, I just got this stand and it seems to be well crafted and sturdy.  I'm using mine just for around the house, not for shows or anything.  If I need to update this review, I will.
