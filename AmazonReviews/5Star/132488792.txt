I'm not a guy who changes strings for every gig. Just the opposite; if they sound good and they're keeping their intonation up and down the neck, then why change them? These strings have been on my Strat for almost 2 years and they still sound great! I bend the heck out of these strings and try as I may, I can't break them.<br /><br />Try a set and discover the fantastic tone and durability of these Rene Martinez designed strings!
