I did a lot of poking around before I settled on the 2i2. At the time, I wasn't sure I needed real studio monitors. Once I came to the conclusion a pair of decent monitors were a good idea, the search became a lot easier. I've got the 2i2 hooked up to a set of Equator D5 monitors using XLR cables (also from Amazon), and they sound great.<br /><br />The drivers seem solid. I have very low latency when using this interface with Ableton Live and my Push controller. I have not experienced any stability issues. The Focusrite interface is an easy recommendation.
