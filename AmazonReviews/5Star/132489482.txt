I have a couple of very old violins, one that's over 400 years old and the &#34;new&#34; one which is only 200 years old.  I was worried about the wood drying out on them so I purchased these in-case humidifiers as recommended by many people on the internet.  My cases have humidity gauges and before I dropped this in my case the humidity gauges always pointed to the lowest end of the &#34;normal&#34; range.  Now, they're both smack in the middle.  So one per case did the trick for me.  (I live in the San Francisco bay area (not in the city) and it's not humid at all, but it  get's pretty warm in the summer and I practice pretty much daily, so I open the case at least once per day.)
