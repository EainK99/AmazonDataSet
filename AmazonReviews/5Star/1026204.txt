They're not Auralex, but they do help, and they do it for a 1/4 of the price. I'll be reviewing them for what they are &#34;Economic Acoustic Bass Traps.&#34;<br /><br />Packaging - These came packaged in a box, and not compressed like other reviewers said. I was very satisfied with how they were packaged.<br /><br />Look - They're well cut, look professional, and aesthetically great. This should by no means be the reason you buy them, but it's a nice touch to a studio.<br /><br />Sound Absorption - An easy way to tell these blocks do treat sound is to yell into them in a monotone pitch, then yell the same way into a wall, and you'll see the difference. I don't have a sound testing lab to get specific, but I can tell they make a difference.<br /><br />How to Adhere - To glue them to the walls, I had to use &#34;3M Spray Adhesive 90&#34;  because the general &#34;3M Spray Adhesive 77&#34; wasn't strong enough to hold it over time. Now let me tell you how to use the 90 Spray so you don't feel stupid like I did. You have to spray both the foam block, and the walls where you want to stick the block, if you only spray one, it will not work, it's in the instructions. You can get this spray at Home Depot, or a similar store.<br /><br />As a general rule, if you have the money, always get the best, if you don't, these will do.
