I was adjusting the nut on one of my VOX guitars, and maybe the TV was on (ok, it was), and maybe I got distracted while filing the low E-string slot (I did). It took quite a bit of digging to find the right size replacement nut, but this was it (also should work for VOX-22 and 55 series, but double check). This is also the size used on my Carvin V220; so I know where to go if I mess that nut up as well. Good buy, stable tuning, easy to work with.
