These strings are great, I really like the low G on my tenor uke. Very easy to put on, and good tone. If takes a little bit before they stay in tune, but that's normal. The string's tone(sound quality) does fade after much heavy playing, so if you play alot, I would recommend changing strings every couple of months(at least). That will ensure you have the best sound. Overall, I've been happy with them.
