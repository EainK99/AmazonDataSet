Great strings that make an old bass fun to play and also promote a way for a bassist to play in the baritone guitar range. I used these on an old SX jazz bass that I wanted to use to lay down a track for a recording I made. Not being a guitarist, I wanted to have another track without muddying up the low register bass line I put down. This fit the bill and then some! I will say that I tried the stings on 2 different basses and on both, the low E and high G are louder than the A and D strings. I was able to resolve this by lowering the pickup on the side that the G string came a crossed. These are very bright and sounds super, I love them!
