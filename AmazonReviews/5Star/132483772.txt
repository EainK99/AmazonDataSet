I have two of these - this one and the 6-string version for my (you guessed it) 6-string.<br />Of the various capos I've used, I've settled on this style for it's certain hold.  A TAD longer to switch, and I can't do it with one hand, so if speed is of the essence, you may want a spring style, but for quality and stability, this is it.
