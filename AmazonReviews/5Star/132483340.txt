I chose this shoulder rest for my 10 year-old after reading about how a competing - and more expensive - brand would break or slip off.  This is our second Everest shoulder rest (the previous one was for a smaller size violin).  It never slips off and my daughter says it is comfortable.  It is lightweight yet durable.  I highly recommend it for a child's violin.
