I bought this case because I have one just like it for my guitar, which has marks all over it after being banged around for 7 years.  I anticipate it will do the same for my banjo.  ONE ISSUE I FOUND: I bought this for the &#34;New 5-String Banjo 24 Bracket with Closed Solid Back By Jameson Guitars&#34;, and the form in the case is a bit large for the resonator of the banjo, but this is easily fixed when I place a towel or a rag in the empty space to prevent the banjo shifting too much.
