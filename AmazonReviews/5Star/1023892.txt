I purchased this for my 17 year old son, who has been a Legend of Zelda fan as long as I can remember, and he loves it! It's well made, and a decent size, just a little smaller than expected. It has a very pretty, clear sound, and seems like it was really easy to learn how to play. It had a music book that was included and he was able to pick up the songs with no problem.<br /><br />For the quality and price, this makes a great gift for any Zelda fanatic, whether they intend to use it for decorative purposes or learn how to play it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased review.
