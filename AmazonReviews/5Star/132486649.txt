I have been lusting after a Telecaster for years, but didn't want to buy a low-end model. I have played and loved a Danelectro for years and have really had no complaints, but I haven't touched it since getting this guitar (except to bring as a back-up to my gigs).<br /><br />The tone is crisp and immaculate. There is no feedback or hum coming from the pickups, as what happens with my bandmate's Tele. I play rocksteady and reggae music.<br /><br />In combination with using the series/parallel rotary switch, position two of the pickup switching (neck & bridge) is perfect for rhythm for nearly every style, and position one (bridge) gives a thinner, crunchier tone for lead/picking and early/skinhead reggae rhythm. I play it through a 40W Fender Hot Rod Deluxe with a 12&#34; Jensen speaker, and I couldn't be happier with this setup.<br /><br />The neck feels wonderful and playing this guitar takes less effort than others I have owned. I had to bang on them to get sounds I wanted, but this Telecaster replicates that with just a flick of my musical wrist.<br /><br />There are no aspects of this guitar that I find the least bit negative. I was really worried about purchasing a guitar online that I hadn't had the chance to play myself before placing my order, but this is the best decision I have ever made.
