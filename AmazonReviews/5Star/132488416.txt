These tripods arrived the very next day after I order them. I wasn't expecting them for at least a week. What a pleasant surprise. They were double boxed and arrived in perfect condition. I don't have big speakers to place on them (just 10\\" woofers) so I don't how they'll handle larger 15\\" woofer speakers but judging from the quality of the tripod, I'm pretty sure they'll work just fine for larger, heavier speakers. Good buy for such a low price.<br /><br />UPDATE: They work perfectly fine with 15\\"s. Tight fit and a little hard to take off but what's important is that they can carry the load.
