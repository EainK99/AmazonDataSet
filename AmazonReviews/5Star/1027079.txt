First - some background on me. I own a totally broken-in and awesome Clearaudio Maestro (best cartridge available IMHO for bdetween $1 and $2000!), as well as a ZYX Airy 3. I have also owned many other phono cartridges, from Denon (DL-110), Clearaudio (Concept MM), Audio Technica (150 MLX, 440 MLA and AT 33EV), a Benz ACE, and others. Back in the 70s and 80s I was exclusively a Pickering, Stanton, and Shure man. I listen mainly to classical music (all types, especially symphonic), but also jazz, soundtracks, and even easy-listening (instrumental). Now, to say just a few brief words about the AT-120 phono cartridge: IT BLEW ME AWAY. I can listen to it and almost NOT MISS the $1000 Clearaudio Maestro! It is an amazing achievement - and I would pay $500 for this cartridge! Want to hear how it sounds? I refer you to my ebay LP ads - they are the ones that start with #HEAR# in the title, so you should be able to search them out easily from among all the ebay vinyl listings. What I have done is post sound clips of the LPs so the prospective buyer can hear the album before buying. The cartridge I used for most of them is the AT120 - it was broken in for over 100 hours to sound like it does now - so go listen if you are curious! Words may fail, but your ears will tell you - this is a superb cartridge, and should be selling for HUNDREDS MORE, LoL. Mind you, my ebay audio clips that you will click on are mere mp3 files, so the AT120 will sound of course much better with your home system! So, LISTEN TO THE SOUND CLIPS = then you can BEGIN to appreciate the sound of this AT120 phono cartridge, and agree with all the positive evaluations/ratings. By all means BUY ONE soon before Audio Technica realizes their error! Happy listening!
