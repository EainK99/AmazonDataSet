It's a great mic for the price. Don't get it twisted it's a cheap mic but it's so cheap that it works. I had to mess with the levels on my hn4 but once I got it working I loved it. I use this mic for vacation videos. I wired up my wife and step daughter while we go out and I can't complain. Not everybody is a film maker in the wing. Some of us want to just record family having fun. It's not perfect but it is cheap. I have a feeling they repack this thing and resell it but it's a good mic. And I plan to keep ordering them because I can use a $.99 splitter and boom. Or plug one device into the two hn4 ports. I like this mic.
