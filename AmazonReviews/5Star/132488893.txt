I now have a couple of pairs of these and will not go a different route for any bass I plan to use live.  I have tried different types of so-called \\"strap locks\\" but many were simply an odd shaped thing that was supposed to make it less likely for your strap to fall off.  If you have every had your strap slip off during a gig or even practice you quickly realize no matter how securely the strap seems if you move it the right (or wrong) way they can slip off sending your expensive instrument plummeting to the ground.<br /><br />Get these, they're awesome!
