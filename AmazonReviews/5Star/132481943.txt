Allot of website forums will tell you some crazy ways to tune your instrument, using the Snark sn-6 tuner I've been getting great accuracy and haven't had an issue with it ever sense I bought it. The meter is easy to read and takes some time to get used to but I couldn't be happier with it! I will recommend this product to beginners of all ages, and professionals.
