VERY inexpensive solution for anyone wanting to try slide guitar without buying a new guitar. I threw it on a Simon & Patrick acoustic that I wasn't using for much else, and discovered that I prefer this setup to several commercial lap slide guitars and resonator guitars that I've tried in the $400-$1000 range.  Wonderful surprise. I was careful with string guages and tension considering I don't know that the Simon and Patrick bridge is built for the heavier gauges normally used for lap slide guitar.  Working great so far.
