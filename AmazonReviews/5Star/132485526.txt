I have had a problem with initial order, my box would not charge, and even though somehow it charged 2 days later, i already got a replacement order...<br /><br />My replaced item is what i was expecting and more:<br />1) BT - connects every time, good quality sound, and flawless operation (i would note though its not 50 feet range but close enough before it starts to cough). Also does not need a code to connect, just disconnect it with a button on a unit, and other user can connect to it - simple!!!.<br />2) sound is powerful, or i should say powerful enough for the size and the need (i took it to the beach, park, my patio, my house - great sound.<br />3) Battery - i have not experimented with 50h play time, but i would believe it, i have been playing mine for a month, hour here, hour there, and its still holding charge like nothing happened - battery life is amazing in my opinion and for my needs!<br /><br />I would recommend...but consider other options of this type of box: there are some with wheels, some smaller and larger depending on your needs...sometimes i feel like i would not mind having wheels on it...or some kinda of top handle where i can grab it with one hand and carry like a bag...
