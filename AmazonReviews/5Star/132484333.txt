My daughter has been playing flute for 4 years in middle school and high school. We looked at 10 different flutes on Amazon and chose this one. We bought it as a replacement for an off-brand silver-coated internet flute that had badly tarnished/peeled to a pinkish color in many places and that was falling apart with pads where my daughter had to push twice as hard to make them seal. The Hallelu HFL-200 Flute arrived in a week. My daughter was pleasantly surprised with how well the new flute looks and sounds. She is even able to play the lower-octave notes that she has never been able to play on her older flute. She did have to adjust to a pinkie-key that is in a slightly different place than on her old flute. We have had it for a month and she still loves it. Now, we will wait and see how well the Nickel-finish holds up against acidic skin oils and time. I did purchase a new cleaning kit, and a Square trade extra 2-year warranty against mechanical failures for $7 extra from Amazon, just in case there are any serious problems. Really glad we went with this flute instead of the $600 beginner/intermediate flute my local music store was trying to push on us. I plan to update my review, if/when we run into any problems.
