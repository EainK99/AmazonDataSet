I used the unit on Cycle Oregon to charge my phone and Garmin 810 GPS/Computer. I found the best strategy  was to charge my Anker® Astro2 8400mAh Portable Dual-Port External Battery on the ride. Then I could charge the phone and computer in camp. The battery was less sensitive to changes at varied sun shine levels. The phone would stop charging at low input. The Garmin would tend to turn on thinking it was attached to a computer. I concluded a good portable battery (8000 to 15,000mAh)is the best way to manage the TSSS charger.<br />Example:[[ASIN:B00DMWV3EU Anker 2nd Gen Astro2 9000mAh External Battery Charger Rapid-Recharge (3A Output) Dual-Port Shake-to-Wake Portable Highest-Energy-Efficiency Backup Power Pack)]]
