I am a hobbyist musician. My wife ordered it for my birthday. I was very happy to get it. The workmanship is really very good. The tune is so sweet. As the strings are made of nylon, the tuning holds for a short time at first which is not unusual, it happens to guitar also.But it get stable in two or three days. n a nutshell It is beautiful and I recommend it to everyone.
