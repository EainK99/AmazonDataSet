These are little gems. The scale is a tiny 21 inches (as opposed to 34 in standard scale). The neck cross section is similar to a Precision bass.  Because it uses polyurthane strings, it sounds bigger than life, Like a tiny go-cart being able to corner at 60 mph, the uBass is speedier than it's big brother. It does take a while for the strings to stretch to stability and you have to do it evenly because if the strings stretch unevenly, it can throw the 12 fret octive off.
