This tool works great!  I hadn't played my guitar in awhile (two jobs, little free time :-(  ), so I bought new strings to put on.  Even having to get used to using this tool for the first time, all went well and easy.  There were no issues for me with the peg puller as others had, it worked very well, all pegs lifted up smoothly without marring the bridge.<br /><br />I found this tool to be well made and solid. As others have stated the string cutter cuts sweet ... smooth and effortless, all strings even the low E. The tuning machine turner fit fine and turned well. All in all, a welcome addition to my guitar case. I play a Guild D50.
