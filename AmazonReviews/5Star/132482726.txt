For my son and daughter, who are just learning and goofing around, these are cheap strings so they are easy to replace if they break or can't tune. Nothing spectacular about them, but for beginners for the price, they can't be beat. I'll buy them again, especially since my son is prone, for some strange reason, to breaking (snapping them--I think he overtunes just to watch them snap), but it's not the fault of the strings. I've tuned and played on these, and I've not had any issues with them. They have a decent sound and feel and for the price, they are worth it.
