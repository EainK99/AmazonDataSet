Well made, handsome, great intonation, lovely sound. The tenor size is very comfortable to play. Some like the Low G tuning, some like the traditional G, which I currently prefer. No worries, because the strings are very easy to change on these Kamoas. I also  prefer the gear tuners the  tenor uses as opposed to the peg tuners. Again, personal preference. Customer service @ Larry's and Kamoa has been excellent. They are obviously proud of their ukes and have been quick to answer my questions via email or phone. Joe Bonnano (the Kamoa Guy) is very helpful & accessible. I now own two Kamoas (pineapple E series & this one). My experience dealing with Kamoa has made me trust this brand. I am a satisfied customer :)
