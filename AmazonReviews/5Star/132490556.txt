Well the color is better than I would expect, even with a fashionable look. The strings are rusty(and soft), which I replace right after receiving it. Generally it sounds Ok for the price, comes with very careful protection and everything it would need(except a cable!!!!) Plus it's a little small and light, but very nice when you're travelling around and just want something cheesy to start with. Love it!!
