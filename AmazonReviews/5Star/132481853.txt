The only other mute you should have is the tiny dime sized one you need for playing during a concert. This bad boy is the one you need to have on hand if you travel or live in a apartment or practice ad odd hours. It will make your beastly Viola Roar sound like a whispered hum. Just make sure they send the brass one, not the rubber one which will, i guarantee you 100% will not fit.
