I used this cable while touring all this summer for around 40 shows in my live rig.  I ran this one from my pedal board to my amp.  Stepped on at every show, fast set up and take down required so it took some abuse and still held up strong. Performed very well. I have been using Monster Jazz cable for years without a problem.  The Monster Jazz cable is VERY thick. I like the diameter of this Planet Waves cable much more.  I also have the Monster Rock cable. Slightly smaller diameter than the Jazz but still larger than the Planet Waves and feels much cheaper.  To how they sound against each other, I can't say. I haven't done a side by side caparison.<br /><br />Over all I think I'll be using Planet Waves more often for my main cable runs.
