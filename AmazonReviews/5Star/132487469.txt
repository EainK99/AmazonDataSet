made in u.s.a....remo quality, the cs despite the &#34;retro' stigma  is still what I prefer on my 24's. full, round focused tones, no annoying uncontrollable over-ring. Can easily be tuned and muted to solid punch or tight &#34;click.&#34; Look you're going to use some form of flalom patch anyway, right?... My only other choices in heads are plain,clear heads. Start wide open and adjust to your sound, don't start with a sound that you can't adjust out of.
