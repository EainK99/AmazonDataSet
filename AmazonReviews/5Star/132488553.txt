Why does anyone buy a American Fender anymore??  This axe is great out of the box.  I tuned it up and it plugged it right in and wow.....what a sound.  The pickups are hot and almost have a humbucking tone to them. I did eventually put fresh strings on it and I changed the saddles to a set of roller saddles that I had lying around. Honestly it didn't need them tho. The only fault I can find is the trem won't stay in tune but that's pretty typical of all Strats. I even watched some YouTube instructionals on trem setup and it still goes out of tune.  Whatever...I cranked it down and made it a hardtail. Problem solved. Beginner guitarist?  This guitar will last you a lifetime!  Expert guitarist?  This guitar will be a valued axe to put in your collection for gigging, recording...whatever.  Awesome!
