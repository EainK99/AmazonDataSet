This is the guitar you want to start learning on.  There is no need to get something more expensive when you are just starting out.  I started with a Hohner Dreadnought like this one about 10 years ago.  It played great, and it's tone actually improved quite a bit with age.  I was glad I didn't buy something more expensive because as I learned to play, I learned what type of sound and style of play I preferred.  I don't play Dreadnoughts anymore (though I can) because I prefer a less edgy tone.  (I now play a very nice vintage Martin 000).<br /><br />This guitar is perfect for learning on for a couple years.  By then you'll know what you like, and you'll have earned the right to splurge on something nicer.
