Bought this guitar for my girlfriend, she had a larger one from an uncle and her hands where too small to reach some notes. Needless to say this guitar fixed the problem. It looks great and it's a hybrid.<br /><br />My only disclaimer? The backside is made of plastic and not wood. Only the front is made of wood. But you know what? Nobody's looking at the back, so who cares.
