These stands are wicked cool. Sleek and a nice look. I love the fact that they are C-shaped which allows for you to put items under the speakers. More desk space! They are very heavy duty. They hold my M-Audio BX5a monitors with as much ease as Arnold Schwarzenegger holds a 35kg kettle bell in his delicate arms.
