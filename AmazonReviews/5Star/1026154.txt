I bought this guitar at a local shop because I was going to put it in layaway.  (My husband just charged it, so I have it now!)  I have been looking at it for months.  It was the same price as on Amazon.  It is just beautiful, much darker than the picture.  The action is perfect and the sound is sweet.  I am no expert, but it seems soft, but you can make it loud, too.  The shape and size are perfect, and very comfortable to me.  I got a gig back to protect it and I love the dark matte finish and the understated abalone details.  I HAVE to pick it up and play it daily; I cannot help myself.  I am very very happy with this guitar.
