I don't blow a huge ton of money on things like this, but of the various over-ear headphones I've bought, these are the best.<br /><br />I'm not a huge audio-snob (no offense to those who are) so I don't think I'd be able to explain to you how these sound compared to other headphones. I did notice though that voices, like speaking and talking voices, had somewhat of an odd sound to them. Vocals in music was perfectly fine, but when I was watching a Let's Play on youtube, it seemed like the guy's voice was being run through a filter... But I think these are more music-oriented headphones than ones used for sound in general.<br /><br />So if you aren't super particular about audio quality, and have a set headphone-budget of $20, these would be a great buy.<br />Oh, and it came with a 1/4&#34; adapter so I can use it for my keyboard (which was the reason for buying these in the first place).
