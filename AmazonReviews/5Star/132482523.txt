At first I was a little disappointed when i got it in the mail.  I'd been looking for a cheap ride with a good bell and good stick def, but that i could crash on as well.  While this cymbal is labeled as med heavy,  its more along the lines of medium, maybe just in between med, and med heavy.  Wuhan cymbals are usually thinner than other brands.  First i tried the traditional 20\\" wuhan medium ride and sent it back right away.  it was way too thin and had no stick def.  the bell was decent and had a GREAT crash but i needed some ping too.  After playing with the 21\\" cymbal for a couple weeks it has broken in a bit and it's sounding great.  Its got great stick def, a solid bell, and is even crashable.  It is a very loud and cutting.  very bright.  It is well worth the money for any level of player.  Wuhan cymbals are the BEST entry level cymbals.  And i only call them entry level because of the price.  the wuhan traditionals KILL any ZBTs or B8s .  They're made of the same material all the higher end cymbals are made of, b20 bronze, just made in china.  They also LOOK amazing with a brilliant finish and a very nice hand hammered look.  I own two traditional 16\\" crashes and they are just as good as my friends A customs.  The only problem with Wuhan is the consistency.  My 21\\" ride might be just what I'm looking for but yours may be a bit different for they're all handmade.  If you don't like it at first, play it a couple weeks, let it break in, and if you still don't like it GET AN EXCHANGE.  Try another one!  It might be that the specific cymbal you got didn't suit you but the next one will be perfect!  Give Wuhan a chance! you wont regret it!
