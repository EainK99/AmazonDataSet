OK, so if you own your own home and are trying to replicate RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL, or a Yankee Stadium Public Address system, YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE.<br /><br />But, for normal people, these are what you've dreamed about, while your significant other ranted that you'd get evicted, for noise disturbance.<br /><br />Now, I live in a concrete building, in Orlando and received 4 of these beasts, to replace my, once in style, tiny speakers, which were loud, but out of style. My center was replaced, less than a year ago.<br /><br />I also run a 1000 watt, front firing, powered sub along with it.<br /><br />Now, let me tell you, I worked at an airport, for 10 years, before retiring and heading south. So, I absolutely KNOW what loud is. And, let me tell you, these speakers fit the bill.<br /><br />So, I recommend these, whole heartedley. They're perfect for normal everyday use. But, if you're a goose, and don't match your RMS, OHMS IMPEDANCE AND WATTAGE, In correlation to your existing equipment, you are your own worse enemy.<br /><br />As for my system; It could blow the lid off of a Sherman Tank.
