Pardon my long review here, but it details the long and winding road that led me to buy a V-Amp.<br /><br />I've been playing heavy stuff for the better part of 20 years. From Testament and Pantera heavy chunky stuff, to brutal death metal, to my current project which could be classified as modern melodic doom metal (Saturnus, early Katatonia, Betray My Secrets, Cryptal Darkness, My Dying Bride, etc)<br /><br />I've always been on the quest for better amazing heavy but defined (and not cookie-cutter) tone. I'm super ultra particular about sound and tones in general. Definitely very much a techie and a gear guy.<br /><br />While in recording school in 1995 I was very lucky to come across a guy desperation-selling a truly one-of-a-kind custom shop neck-thru ESP with an EMG 81 in bridge only, and the original hardshell ESP case, both for $600. It had volume, tone, and the one EMG. It also had a Floyd Rose - I detest floating tremolos - so I had it \\"blocked\\" so it didn't move. A straight-up metal guitar with reverse headstock, and my first EMG 81. This was really my first true extreme metal guitar. My main guitar before the ESP was a prototype S-series Ibanez which was actually made for Satriani that I found for cheap, used at a local music store.<br /><br />Anyway. Soon after getting the ESP, I began experimenting with low tuning - down to B and lower with thick strings. At the time I had an enormous heavy rack full of equipment to \\"almost\\" achieve the sound I was looking for. I had an expensive tube preamp (ADA MP1) running into two or three other units in the 9-space - very heavy - rack. One notable was a 31-band EQ which almost allowed me to shape the tone into what I was looking for. Almost. From the MP1 and EQ I went into a 300W Crown power amp, into a full-range PA cabinet. Sounds crazy, right? Nope. Hell no. Tone. Tone.<br /><br />A solid-state power amp and an EQ cabinet???! For a guitar rig? WTF? Well. I found no joy whatsoever in the any of the guitar amps that others ranted about. The Marshalls. The Mesa-Boogies. Crates. Laneys. Combos. Half-stacks.<br /><br />No matter what the amp rig, it just didn't have the drive and crunch and definition and all around sound that I was aiming for. Guitar amplifiers - and trust me, I swear I tried them all at the time - didn't give me the tone to start to work with, and the controls (EQ and otherwise) certainly did not afford me enough flexibility to shape my tone. Even the Mesa Dual-Rec that a lot of guitar players seem to love just didn't cut it. Even a modified Dual Rec just didn't do it. Also, I was never a fan of the fact that there were so many variables with a guitar amp that could change the tone that I worked so hard to get. Humidity? Tubes on the way out? Different 6L6s? Tubes?<br /><br />Why spend all that time and money building a tone to have a tube amp head color the hell out of it? Guitar amps weren't working for me at all. Of course traditionalists SWORE that I needed a traditional rig for \\"real tone\\".<br /><br />Yeah. Well... I'm not a traditionalist.<br /><br />My tone was very drivey, but very clear and \\"sharp edged\\". ...However, it took a 9-space rack, and the tone was still a step or two away from what I was really going for. But a lot closer than what came out of those guitar amps.<br /><br />Got really sick of hauling around a giant rack full of equipment just to get my tone. Fortunately, right about then, the music store nearby that I spent so much of my time at just got a new pedal called the Metal Zone from Boss. My salesman suggested that I try it. I kinda rolled my eyes and plugged it in. It sounded like my MP1, but better. It had the drive and clarity I was looking for, and somehow this ~$100 pedal sounded better than my $500+ tube preamp. And it didn't weigh 252,000,000 pounds. With some EQ and a good noise gate, it would get me damn close to what I was trying to achieve.<br /><br />I got rid of the MP1 and my enormous EQ, and that friggin' huge heavyrack, and bought the Metal Zone. With the EQ and noise gate of the original Digitech Studio Quad that I ended up buying along the way, my quest for the ultimate tone was closer to concluding.<br /><br />ESP -> Metal Zone -> Studio Quad for EQ and gate -> Crown power amp -> PA cabinet was really crushing, and I shocked a lot of other metal guitar players with how it sounded... and how unconventional it was. People would walk around the setup as if it were an alien that just crashed to earth, trying to fathom what I had going on. A couple of guitar players that I played a show with ended up using my rig instead of theirs because of how good it sounded.<br /><br />I used that rig for a number of years, and was very happy with it. It was as close as I thought I'd ever get to the tone I had yearned for years prior.<br /><br />Then I hear about this \\"Pod\\" thing. Amp modeling something or other. No, it's not a pedal. No, it's not a rack unit. The hell is it, then? Someone ranted about how it sounded. I went back to the music store that I practically lived at, and tried it out. Being a gearhead, I tweaked it up to see what it'd do that my Metal Zone didn't. I was disappointed. Sure, it sounded cool, sure it was a little clearer, and more modern... but I didn't need chorus and reverb and delay and all sorts of crap that some shredder in leather boots and teased hair who tuned up to F would whack it over.<br /><br />Simple crushing clear tone with a ton of drive was all I was ever looking for. I just didn't get it with the Pod. Happy with what I had, I kept using the Metal Zone and EQ/gate into my solid state power amp and PA cabinet. That was the original Pod that I tried.<br /><br />In the very late 90s - early 2000s? I found out about the original Behringer V-Amp. Going \\"yeah yeah whatever I tried that Pod thing\\", I gave it a go anyway. It looked stupid, the V-Amp did. It was a fruity blue color, it felt like a toy, and \\"it's shaped sorta like a silly guitar?\\". Eh. This thing is gonna suck. I foraged through the settings and built my own tone on a settings basis, and was ready to give it a go.<br /><br />I plugged the ESP into it, and from there into a power amp and PA cabinet that they had in the store. I hit the signature low open power chord (it was B for me at the time)... chills.<br /><br />Holy F'ing S, it's my tone. IT'S MY TONE!!! THIS IS THE TONE I HAVE SPENT YEARS LOOKING FOR! It had the drive. It had the clarity. It's the tone!!!<br /><br />...how can a fixed three band EQ on this silly blue plastic thing do everything I need it to? WTF? This thing has a gate, too!??!<br /><br />It was like my birthday. I was amazed. For what I was after, it was perfect. And it weighed about what my Metal Zone pedal did. And I didn't need the Studio Quad. At all. It cost less than my Metal Zone did. Holy crap.<br /><br />I bought it. The Metal Zone never saw the light of day again. As a side note, the Metal Zone that I bought turned out to be a prototype (too) and it sold for a ridiculous amount on eBay. Who knew?<br /><br />Back to the V-Amp. I used it and used it and used it and used it. Recorded a couple of EPs with it. I had left it at my guitar player's place so he could jam through it, and the band broke up in the meanwhile. It ended up staying at his house when we parted ways. Whatever. The V-Amp 1 was pretty beaten up by that point, dirty, buttons didn't really work, the output jacks were iffy... whatever. He can have it.<br /><br />Bought a V-Amp 2 to replace it. Still had the drive - and that tone - that I needed. That's the important thing. Cabinet 15. Modern High Gain amp model. Compressor cranked. Reverb off. Tight. Heavy as F. More of the same. Amazing heavy tone. I used the V-Amp 2 for a couple of years.<br /><br />Equipment isn't cared for the best in my possession. The jacks and knobs on the V-Amp 2 ended up on the way out, and many of the buttons simply didn't work anymore. It got shelved, and immediately I started to seek a new V-Amp 2 to replace the one on the way out. I called B&H Photo and Video to order one as their website showed that they didn't have any in stock.<br /><br />He put me on hold, and came back to tell me that they didn't have the V-Amp 2 anymore, but they had the new V-Amp 3, which came with a recording interface, and that he could do it for like $5 more than what the V-Amp 2 was going for. Done. Sold. I ordered it.<br /><br />As I had a great digital recording interface already, I tossed the included USB one aside. I think I might have given it away. Tweaked up the V-Amp 3, and yep, there's my tone again.<br /><br />Along the way I ended up buying an ESP/LTD MHB400 baritone with EMG 81/85 pickups (native B tuning!!!) and sold the ESP custom. Amazing guitar, perfect EMG tone, and sustain for months.<br /><br />If you're looking for great extreme metal tone, have or get a guitar - any guitar - with an EMG 81 in the bridge, and BUY A V-AMP.<br /><br />Forget pedals. Forget those Zoom and DOD/Digitech/Boss, whoever multieffects units. Especially if you are doing direct input recording. The V-Amp is all you need. It's got the crushing tone you need. Do you really want to set 75 parameters? I'm a gear head and a techie, and even I don't.<br /><br />Yes, I occasionally throw some reverb onto my rhythm tone for leads. Maybe a tiny little bit of EQ tweak. But that's it.<br /><br />OK, so you want chorus and delay and other toys? It'll do it. It sounds good if that's your thing. I've played around with it. Used it for one guitar line on a track here and there. The other effects do sound good.<br /><br />It is a very straight forward and easy to use preamp that emulates guitar amps, if that's what you want it to do.<br /><br />More importantly, in my world and in my applications, it's the crushing tone I've always wanted, and for around $100. With gain to spare. And it weighs, what, a pound? 2?<br /><br />One thing of note, though - the durability sucks. It's not something you'd want to play out with if it's going to be on the floor. If you plan to switch patches on the fly, there is a pause in between doing so. If you're going to keep it, say, on top of an amp, and out of harm's way, and just use one tone - awesome.<br /><br />The jacks tend to get beaten up pretty easily. The buttons, too. But, uh, dude, it's a hundred bucks. People pay that for like... overdrive pedals that sound like a smashed bag of ass. It's a hundred... bucks.<br /><br />I mean, for around $100... I spent more than that on pot back when I was a stoner and a teenager, and that'd last me the weekend. The V-Amp will bring you more joy than a half ounce of bud. I promise.<br /><br />If you're looking for something more heavy duty, they make a couple of other versions of this V-Amp - rackmount, etc - but expect to pay more.<br /><br />Apparently there is a small pedal version of this that looks to be more durable, may be cheaper - but I can't guarantee that it'll do what this one will - or achieve the tone that I have. Maybe it will. Let me know...<br /><br />Anyhow...<br /><br />If you, like me now, just do (home) studio recording, and don't play out anymore - if this is going to stay on your desk, it's the ultimate heavy tone for next to nothing. It's practically free.<br /><br />Forget about putting a mic on an amp and finding the right axis to mic your cabinet, and the right room to set it up in, and the right this, and the right that... forget about it. A couple of minutes spent dialing this thing in, and wham, you're there.<br /><br />It's super-easy to use. Forget about the built-in presets.<br /><br />I need to stress this point again. If you are looking for crushing extreme metal tone, BUY THE V-AMP. Just do it. Forget the Pod. It's overpriced and it doesn't sound as good for heavy stuff.<br /><br />Sure, there are multieffects processors that I see on here that are $300, $400, $500... do know that in many cases, more expensive is just that. More expensive. Spending more doesn't necessarily (and rather infrequently) get you better tone.<br /><br />If you play metal - extreme metal - and want real deal heavy tone, here it is. Add to cart. Just do it.<br /><br />Nick<br />multiply.infinity on ReverbNation<br /><br />EDIT: I got a Pod XT used for around $100. The tone is way better than the V-Amp and the original Pod and way more flexible than both. With that said, my Pod XT has the Metal patch upgrade. Without it, it sounds like crap. If you go the Pod XT route, be absolutely certain that it has the Metal patch upgrade or you won't be happy.<br /><br />Want good tone cheap? Buy a V-Amp. For the price you can't go wrong.k a new V-Amp 2 to replace the one on the way out.
