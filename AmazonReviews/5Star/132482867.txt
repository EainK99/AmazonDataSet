I put these lights behind my TV stand/bookcase, and they look awesome! This kit comes with everything you need. The remote works well and has a lot of color options on it. The 3M tape on the back really does the trick and sticks nicely, but doesn't leave a nasty goo when you peel it back off.<br /><br />One issue I had was that this listing says that it includes an \\"L-Shape 90 degree Right Angle Female Connector\\" and at least in my package, this was NOT included. Oh well, still works well, and you can sort of bend these around corners anyway.
