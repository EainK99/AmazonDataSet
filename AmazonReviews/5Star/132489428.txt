My son's band gigs at least once a week, and since he's not old enough to drive, Dad does all the drum equipment transport.  While I'm sure this bag is not for the pro traveling across the country on tour, it's more than adequate for the regular working drummer driving to gigs.  It easily swallows all the hardware for a typical 4 or 5 piece kit, including mic stands, and it can hold the high-hat stand without disassembly .  It seems to be holding up very well even with heavy use, and the skids on the bottom are great for stairs.  I will update the review if any problems develop, but after a few months of heavy use, I'm giving it a &#34;double thumbs up&#34;.
