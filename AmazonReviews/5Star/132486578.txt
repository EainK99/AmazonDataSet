I received the Joyo JF-13 AC Tone pedal on the day promised by the shipper.  I set the pedal up and it sounded fantastic as so many others have found out. When I placed the pedal on my pedal board and plugged it into my power source I found that the unit didn't light up telling me I had power to it.  It works well with a 9V battery but that's not what I want or need having to replace the batteries all the time and not knowing when the unit is going to run out of battery power during a show was just unacceptable to me. So I'm returning it and I'm going to purchase another one to replace this pedal.  I'm really impressed by the way this pedal responds to touch and attack when using the magical voice control knob. I know it's not going to make my amp into a AC-30, but it sure is close with some tweaking of the 6 control knobs at your disposal. This pedal, for the price is better than some of the more expensive boutique pedals that I've purchased over the years I've been playing and sounds better than most of them too! Bottom line this pedal rocks!
