If you are on a budget and can not afford to go wireless just yet, or there are just other pieces of equipment much hire on the priority list. You cannot go wrong with this little jewel. The cord is quite long and has never present itself to be a problem. Most importantly though, the sound quality is excellent! I would highly recommend this microphone at twice the price.
