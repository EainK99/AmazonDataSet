Both the program and the mic are outstanding.  I was expecting a cheap quality mic, but it is a heavy duty, ultra sensitive mic with a long cord and is truly plug and play (USB).  The program is a powerhouse.  If you are familiar with DAWs, you will fly with it right away.  If you are new to DAWs, you will want to study the videos offered both by Mixcraft and by others on YouTube in order to appreciate all of the wonderful things possible with Mixcraft.  Warning:  this program is so much fun I find myself staying up too late at night -- just can't seem to put it to sleep:-).  It's great!
