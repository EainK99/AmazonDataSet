As a musician I can attest that these headphones provide amazing clarity and sound range.  All the sounds from the lowest bass to the highest trebles are very well represented.  I will say that if you like absurd amounts of bass you may consider a different pair of headphones, but if you like the all around music experience these are the way to go.<br />The sound quality is so good that sometimes when I’m listening to a song I’ve never heard before, I’ll hear a snare or something and turn around thinking someone is behind me because it sounds so real.
