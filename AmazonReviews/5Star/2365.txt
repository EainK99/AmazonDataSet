As a college student with a relatively small apartment with close neighbors, this product is a godsend. It produces quite a warm sound for such a small and well priced amplifier, and it even has a headphone jack which allows me to play very late at night without disturbing a soul. It is the perfect size for storage in a drawer or cabinet, and even comes with a small battery which you can use to play if you find yourself without an outlet or power. I have had this amp about 3 months now and it seems to be holding up very well with no degradation in sound quality, even though I have knocked it off my desk onto hardwood flooring at least 5 or 6 times which is really telling of the build quality! I would highly recommend this product to someone looking for a smaller amp or just someone looking for some great bang for your buck!
