Don't take this as gospel as I own two electric guitars. Years ago in my divorced period I screwed around with a guitar & a 15 watt amp. Somewhere I got a 20 or so foot cable and commenced to my noise making. All sorts of electric sounding pops and hums would start & stop. I figured that was the way amplifiers sounded. Period. My single coil pickups fighting with all the other plugged in things I thought.<br /><br /> I decided to get serious about practicing a few months ago And sitting there looking down at the floor at that old black and abused chord got me to thinking. So After perusing the internet I bought the Spectraflex cable. They even have colors. Not that that means anything but hell I am partial to the black & red. Well This cord keeps everything sounding velvety quiet be it double coil , single coil,  even with all manner of other things plugged in around the area.  I am vert happy with this cord & it looks very cool as well.
