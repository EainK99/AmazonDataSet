When I first started playing guitar, to strum chords, I used Fender thin picks, which always broke.  Eventually, I discovered Dunlop nylon picks, which have a grip feature and never break. That alone makes them highly desirable. Recently, as I have been playing bluegrass mandolin and guitar, I have switched to heavier picks; specifically, the Dunlop 1.5 mm.  These are fantastic.  What the expert teach is true; a heavy, stiff pick is the secret to playing faster solos. With a hard pick your wrist is flexible and relaxed whereas with a thin, softer pick your wrist tenses up and you can't be as agile in picking the notes in a solo. These Dunlop 1.5 mm picks are highly recommended.
