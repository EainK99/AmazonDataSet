This tuner works really well. The clip is designed for an acoustic guitar head. I guess that's the \\"G\\" in AW2GRE. The mic and the piezo both seem very accurate. You can adjust the reference frequency (\\"calibration\\" as the manual calls it). Smaller than you think which is nice. Clips on securely. Very swivel-y so can be positioned many ways. The light is great. Comes with battery. (Not sure of battery life, only had it a week or so, and I'm not using it every day). Manual says might harm finish if left on the guitar for long periods, but, acoustic guitars are best left in the case when not in use, so not a problem if you're using a case when not playing.
