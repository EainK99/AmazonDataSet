This is the best distortion pedal ever. Simple and effective. If you can't get awesome tone with this pedal - rock, metal, thrash, death, punk, whatever - with this pedal and a good tube amp there is something wrong with you or you need better gear. I consider it a solid preamp, don't expect to sound like Zakk Wylde without hot pickups, some solid tube crunch and a good reverb and chorus to match.
