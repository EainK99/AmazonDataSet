These guitars are wonderful! I've been playing 10 years and I've never owned a 12-string as easy to play as this one. The action is low and the strings that come on the guitar aren't that bad for factory strings. The pictures don't do this guitar justice at all. The spruce top is slightly darker than the pictures and the ash sides and back are stunning! Worth every penny!!!
