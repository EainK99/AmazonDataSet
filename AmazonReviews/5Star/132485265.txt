I wanted to buy a good digital piano for my daughter so she can practice at home. Also, when time permits, I could play for fun. As the experts say all the time, touch and tone are most important for any digital piano and my budget was to find a good compromise under a thousand dollars. There are many brands and models in this price range but Yamaha has the most brand reliability. Other brands I had considered were Kawai, Roland and Kurzweil. They're all good with their own pluses and minuses so it boiled down to the basics - touch and tone.<br /><br />The DGX 650 is a new model and replaces the older 640. This model has the PureCF sound engine and sounds very good (lots of samples for each key from a real Yamaha grand piano). As for touch, it's a weighted keyboard (not fully or heavily weighted) which Yamaha calls GHS (Graded Hammer Standard) - it's definitely weighted when you compare with entry level Casio keyboards but not quite Yamaha's GH. However, for the price range and the purpose (to use for practice from beginner to intermediate) it's plenty. As for sensitivity levels, I could not decipher from specifications but I think it's got atleast 3 levels. So, it is good enough.<br /><br />Now, there are plenty of styles and songs. So many in fact, that it might take a very long time to explore them all. You can do dual (split), layer, etc. A single button is dedicated to go right back to the Grand Piano voice so it is very helpful for my daughter who only wants to focus on the Piano unlike me who likes to play with different sounds and styles. So, this is first and foremost a digital piano and then all the extra bells and whistles! There are many more features which I'm sure I will forget (smart chord, learn to play, etc, etc) and I can't vouch for them since I haven't yet gotten to play with those.<br /><br />Recording via USB is supported to MIDI or WAV format. WAV is good but I wish it was MP3!! As for connectivity options, you have both USB to host and USB todevice. For techies, I have been told you can connect iPad using the USB connector to this piano and discover a world of options and use it for learning, playing music, etc., but again, I'm yet to try it out myself and don't know how well it works. There is a single headphone connector which my daughter uses to practice without disturbing anyone else. However, a cool feature is that you could activate the speakers also when connected to the headphones. Recording to Garage Band or other software using this feature is very, very useful since you can record your music along with the built in songs/styles (which we already paid for when we bought the DGX 650) and you can get MP3 (how's that for a workaround to get MP3?) !!<br /><br />When my daughter is ready for more Piano, I will buy a professionally tuned, used upright or baby grand Piano in good condition. The DGX 650 can always be there complementing the real Piano with all those songs/styles/features and when we want to play at midnight silently wearing headphones which we could never do on a real piano :)<br /><br />Last but not the least, don't be misled to believe that more expensive digital pianos are good furniture. Most of them are just compressed wood and if you're really looking for a good Piano which is also good furniture, nothing beats the real thing. I bought mine from my local Guitar Center and they always have hidden coupons which bring down their price by 15 or 20 percent (please ask them) which worked out cheaper than many online prices for me.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I don't work for Amazon, Guitar Center, Yamaha or any other retailer, manufacturer or music company. I'm also not a Piano, keyboard or music expert so please take that into account as you read my review.
