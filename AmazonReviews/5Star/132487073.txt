Loved my last pair of Shures so much, I decided  on another pair after trying other less expensive options.  None of them do such a good job of noise isolation as the Shures,  period.  And the sound quality is very nicely balanced, not too bright,  not too boomy,  just right.  And the replaceable cables make these the very best value hands down.  No buyers remorse here.
