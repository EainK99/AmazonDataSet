I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this Singing Bowl. It's unique in that it comes with a stuffed pillow to place it on. Not a lot of the others had this available. The striker is carved, made of wood and is gracefully curved to allow the hand to easily hold it.<br /><br />The bowl itself is just over 3 inches at the mouth. The pleasing tone was more noticeable for the first 5 seconds then slowly faded. It lasted in total for about 12 seconds.<br /><br />The pictures really don't do it justice. It's a soft gold color of metal that sits on a black pillow with gold trim. It's light and can be transported anywhere. If you want to take it with you, it'll fit in a purse or suitcase with ease. Or just save the small box that it came with and reuse it. It was very well packaged with a fitted non-styrofoam material that will keep it's form for quite a while.<br /><br />It came with instructions on how to use the Singing Bowl, a website for free download of meditation songs, and place where you can leave questions or feedback.<br /><br />All in all, it is a quality Singing Bowl.  My opinion is that it is an exceptional quality, especially for the price! I have to give this 5 stars.
