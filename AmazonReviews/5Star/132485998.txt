Lemme first state that I will probably never go back to using cheap headphones, ear buds, or lower quality audio devices after using these. This might be a bad thing financially, but damn these things are good.<br /><br />You can hear things that you never knew existed in music, movies, or just any audio in general.<br /><br />I make music as a hobby and when using VST's you can really get a good feel for the instruments, especially when adding effects like reverb or delay. Fine tuning is so much easier using the M50's.<br /><br />Seems generic but these offer a really tight, audible low end, with crisp highs and a clear mid-tone.<br /><br />As for comfort I can't complain. NO pressure points, NO fatigue after long usage, and fully adjustable to any head size.<br /><br />Style wise, I mean just look a them! So sexyyyyy<br /><br />The coiled cable is a bit of a pain sometimes but it can definitely wrap around anything making it more versatile.<br /><br />Overall, these headphones give a full blown experience every time I put them on. And continue to please use after use.<br /><br />I recommend these headphones to ANYONE and EVERYONE!
