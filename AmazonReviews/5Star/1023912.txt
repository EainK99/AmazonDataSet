This system is great.  We use it for travelling to taekwondo tournaments and it has not let us down yet!  Battery life is incredible, we went months (only using it on the weekends for about 30 minutes at a time) before having to charge it the first time!  We don't use some of the features, like the radio or microphone, but the sound quality of music is great for us.  Has enough bass and all that jazz, we play mortal kombat, michael jackson, system of a down, etc on it for our music mixes and they sound great even when the volume is turned all the way up.  We like our music loud to get the attention of the judges, and most the time we only have to put it about 1/2 volume to do the job.  The rolling handle makes it easy to lug along from ring to ring, although it seems a bit shakey like it's not secured in all the way; but it hasn't broken yet!  Construction of the unit overall is very sturdy.  We've taken this thing to several states, even flown on a plane with it as the carryon.  I highly recommend this item!
