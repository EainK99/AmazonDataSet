We just upgraded to the full size Giuliani Etude after my child spent that last two years with another Etude (fractional size 1/2). We tried a different budget instrument but were unhappy. So, we opted for another Etude. It is a great choice. Beautiful woods. (Ebony, Maple, Spruce). Includes a nice case and bow. The great thing about it is the full rich tone that does not sound like other instruments in this price range. It is stunningly rich and full, (not boxy) and will be an added bonus to your beginner or intermediate player. Give em the extra edge on the competition without breaking the bank. I had it restrung with Dominant Thomastik strings, and the local luthier raved about it's tone, and kept asking where I picked it up, and \\"how much\\"? The service at Kennedy is top notch as well. You can always find someone to talk to. Upgrading from your previous instrument is easy as well as they accept trade ins. Stop here!
