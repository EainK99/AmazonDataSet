Excellent well-priced starter record player. Bought it from Amazon, had it for 2+ years, and hasn't broken down yet. Easy to hook up even if you are clueless about such things. I've seen (in person) the more expensive models from this manufacturer - and they don't really look that much better or &#34;higher quality&#34;, so the basic model should work for most non-specialty folks.<br /><br />UPDATE: After 2 years, I decided to upgrade to the Audio Technical LP120, which allows me to play THREE speeds (33,45,78) instead of just two on the LP60. The LP120 is 3x the price of the LP60, but the sound isn't 3x as good out of the box (by &#34;sound&#34; I mean I usually only listen to pre-1950s records and classical music). So I maintain that the LP60 is a great starter record player for most folks.<br /><br />The LP120 is a much heavier, larger, professional-looking machine and is manual (whereas LP60 is fully automatic). LP120 allows you to switch headshells whereas the LP60 does not. Since I have some 1940s 78 rpm records (shellac not vinyl), I had to buy the LP120 to get the 78 speed, and buy a new headshell, cartridge and stylus for the wider grooves. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, just get the LP60. If you need to listen to old records of various eras, don't waste money on the LP60. Start off right away with the LP120 or an even more expensive model from Audio-Technica or other makers. This is just the tip of the ice-berg. You can spend infinitely more if you want, but I'm going to be happy with the LP120 for a while. My LP60 is going to a family member who is happy with the basic functionality and the almost-as-good-sound.
