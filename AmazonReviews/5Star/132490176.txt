This strainer has a lot going for it. First is the simple, but effective design. Second is the price: reasonable for a boutique or high-end throw. Of course it's also a direct drop in replacement for the older style of DW throw-offs and a perfect throw for new builds if you either build your own snare drums or have them custom built for you.<br /><br />I like this because of the Gladstone style strainer.  The essence of the design is where the engagement and disengagement of snares are via a sideways lever or bail. In my experience, throws based on that do not stick or bind.  There are many such type throws on the market, but none as solid or as smooth as this one.<br /><br />Another feature that I like is the easy-to-reach fine adjustment knob that is horizontal, and the fact that it employs a magnet to hold the throwoff bail in the engaged position. That feature also eliminates friction mechanisms that stick or bind.<br /><br />DW also sells this throw-off as part of a more complete kit with an interesting, three-position butt.
