It does exactly like it's supposed to. I wasn't sure if the measurements would be exact but it fits my guitar perfectly. The guitar I put it on is a Douglas Hadron FX from Rondo. I upgraded everything but the middle pickup was screwed into the wood so I couldn't adjust the height. I put this on and now it's just like the middle pickup in a pickguard.<br /><br />These are made out of 3-ply pickguard material so if it doesn't fit it could probably be modified to fit. It is shipped from china but it only took about 2 weeks to get to me in Florida. In the past I've waited over a month for things from china.<br /><br />You can pay more and get a metal ring but this works fine for me and I'm sure it will work fine for most others.
