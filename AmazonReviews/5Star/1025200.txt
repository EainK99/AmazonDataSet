I did a lot of research before buying this model and I am so far very pleased with my decision.<br /><br />This is an all digital unit so no Spinal Tap interference from truckers or airplanes.<br />Pros: Very simple set up, no searching through channels its all automatic. The bodypack is nice and durable unlike the cheap plastic of some brands. Also unlike some brands there is no six inch antenna hanging off it which can easily bend or break.<br /><br />The biggest pro with this model is the rechargeable lithium ion battery. I bought am extra to always have one charged. Anyone who has used other wireless units can tell you how they eat batteries.<br /><br />Cons: not rack mountable. I really did want a rackmount unit but sacrificed that option for the rechargeable battery. I'm happy with the decision. This will be attached to my rack via Velcro easily enough.<br /><br />The instrument cable it comes with isn't great. This is true of every wireless unit on the market. It's easy enough to find a much better cable online.<br /><br />Couple months later and I still couldn't be more satisfied. The battery lasts many, many hours and doesn't lose a charge while not in use. I did buy a spare battery to always have one charged and ready to go. I know laugh every time my guitarist (I play bass) has to stop rehearsal to change the batteries in his line 6 wireless. Often he can't get through one rehearsal while I can go a week on one charge.
