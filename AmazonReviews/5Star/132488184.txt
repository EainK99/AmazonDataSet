Not gonna lie, I wasn't sure about this product, as Hohner has always been my go to for my diatonics. As my first chromatic, I didn't wanna skimp and get a cheap harmonica, so I saw this was on sale for much less than standard retail, so I got it. Not gonna lie, I'm very happy with this chromatic harmonica. The tone is very nice and crisp. The only downside is that the lower registry may have a tendancy to buzz (especially lower 1-3 reeds). Solid construction, fantastic tone. The carrying case that comes with it doesn't seem that durable on the outside, but the inside is perfect for what it's protecting.<br /><br />Overall, yes, I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a 16 hole Chomonica, but I've yet to give the Hohner 280 a shot... But if this product's quality is as high as it seems out of the box, I may not ever need one.
