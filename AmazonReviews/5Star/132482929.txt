This base guitar and amp are a perfect fit for me and the set is complete. Put the wiring into place, plug the amp into an outlet and start playing. Of course, as a novice picker, my picking is not so great; but I have purchased good equipment and I will get better. Let's face it, Fender is an established name in the music world, and you cannot go wrong using their products.
