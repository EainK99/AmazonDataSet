This capo looks great. Feels great and works great on any fret on my guitar (Yamaha APX500II). This one is clearly designed to be used for a very long time. The heavy duty aluminum construction stands head and shoulders above the other plastic clip type capos. The spring is well tuned. It securely holds the strings on any fret so there is no buzzing yet is not so tight as to mess with the guitar's tuning when it Is removed.
