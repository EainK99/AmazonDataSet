I used this multi-color LED strip to light up the area under my awning on my motor home.  I also bought some extra 22g 4-strand RBG wire to go between the strip and the controller, which I placed about 8 ft. below.  Everything worked well.  This kit proved to be dependable, and the remote worked flawlessly.  At just $26.49 for the entire kit, it is an exceptional value.  I'm a happy camper.
