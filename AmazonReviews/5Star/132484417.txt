It's pretty amazing how easily this thing works. Unlike my other tuner which needs the room to be quiet so that it can hear my acoustic, this tuner clips on to the head stock and tunes in a noisy room (a must have with a house full of kids running around...haha). The tuner also can change settings between chromatic, guitar, bass, ukulele...Which is great because we just purchased a Ukulele and not used to the tuning yet. This tuner makes it easy.
