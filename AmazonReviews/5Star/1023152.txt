I usually don't leave reviews for products, but I'll leave a good word for these picks:<br />- The sharp points on these picks allow for precision and potentially faster picking; they have good attack.<br />- They seem to be more durable than my Ultex Sharp and Ernie Ball Heavy picks that ground down quickly (tremolo picking).<br /><br />As an aside, I found their smaller size to be a perfect fit for my smaller (6&#34;) hands .
