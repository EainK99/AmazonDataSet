I am finding myself loving all things Wampler and my pedal board is showing it proudly. 40 years, tons and tons of gear and I honestly have some of the best tones I have ever had using Wampler. Brian knows what he's doing and the quality is there. I use the Euphoria for more of a clean boost and it really does shine. My Hot Wired is for serious sustain and crunch.
