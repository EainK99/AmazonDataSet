I have had many headphones in the lifetime. I have beats studios and solos. I also have some Sony's and Bose. These headphones offer the best low and high range of all of them. Bose has them beat for over all sound quality, but they are also nearly 400 dollars. Beats do not come anywhere near close.<br />These headphones are very stylish,have AMAZING bass. I am a dubstep producer, and personally, i would only recommend these and the next model up, HDJ-1500, they are more stylish is all.these headphones are also extraordinarily comfortable.<br /><br />My only drawback is that they are not super sturdy. if not for the fact that they are not the sturdiest in the world, worth the money 3 times over. I personally have the red ones.
