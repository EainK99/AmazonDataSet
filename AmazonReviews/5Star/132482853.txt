I needed some stands for a permanent installation and there aren't many choices that articulate.  These fit the bill nicely.  Very sturdy construction.  I have no fear that the speakers would fall.  I'd just note that not all of the mount is not hidden behind the speaker.  If aesthetics is an issue, consider that fact.
