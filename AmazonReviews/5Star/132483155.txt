The only complaint I have about Dava picks is they are not easy to find...I had to buy mine off Amazon and pay freight (for picks!). I bought the original Dava pick in the '80's and have used them off and on, but when I recently saw the new line, with rubber grip, I had to try them. These are great picks and have improved my playing immensely. Even after playing for decades, I still had pick slippage and Dava has eliminated it. Buy one of these picks and try it...you will be a convert.
