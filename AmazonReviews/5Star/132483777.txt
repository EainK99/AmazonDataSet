This strap is absolutely 100% comfortable!  It fits right over my existing D-Rings on my existing bag.  The strap was well worth the price, and once I sling it across my chest, I hardly feel that it's there, especially since I'm carrying 10-15 pounds!  Note that if you do not sling it across your shoulder (a la seat belt style), it may slip off if you sling it on your shoulder vertically.  Slinging it the seat belt fashion takes care of that.
