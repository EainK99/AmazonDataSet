I bought this for a pool side 80th birthday event taking place over 3 days with 50 people.  Most of the time we streamed bluetooth music to it using a 25 dollar \\"Bluetooth Music Receiver\\" from mono price (PID 7364).  It worked great and was plenty loud at about 60% to max - the home was on a 10 acre plot and we couldn't crank it all the way without disturbing the neighbors.<br /><br />Later at night we routed a karaoke machine through it and had a blast.  With all the inputs we had multiple mics and group singing sessions.<br /><br />I'm really glad I bought this as it helped make the party a huge success.
