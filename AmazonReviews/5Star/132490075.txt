Bought this for my 2 year old. She was playing an air guitar so I thought she needed a real guitar. The price was great! Guitar came as described. The first night, all of the strings came out. No problem, we just put them back in. It comes with extra strings, too. For the price, this was a fun purchase for my future Taylor Swift!
