The iMBA-PS-06MF extension cable is perfect for that extra reach you need with headphones or a microphone that use the 3.5mm size jack.<br /><br />This is the male to female type extension, so it will accept the jack from your device on one end and plug in to the destination port on the other end.<br /><br />The cable is of good quality. The wiring is sturdy and well insulated. It is pliable, yet feels thick and substantial. The connections are of excellent quality, and it fits very well to the devices you are attaching, with a nice \\"click\\" connection.<br /><br />So far, the sound quality seems extremely good. I have heard no additional noise, no popping or other \\"cheap connection\\" interference. Great little cable at a great price. I wish it were available with a 90-degree male jack, but that is not a shortcoming of the product.
