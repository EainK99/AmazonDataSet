I started out with a pack of four of these lights and ended up buying twelve more. These lights are super bright, easy to set up, have power and data linking which means no need for a powerstrip, they are lightweight and easy to transport. I haven't had a single failure. The built in strobe setting is great, and these lights do a great job lighting up a stage, I would say that the maximum throw is about 30', but they lit up the back wall of the room I used them in which is well over 100' from the stage where they were mounted. These are awesome lights.
