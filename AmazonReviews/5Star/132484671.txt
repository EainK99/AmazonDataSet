I don't see any point in repeating what the other reviewers have already said about R-05's features and performance, so I'll just add that the build quality is also impressive. It has a very solid feel in the hand.<br /><br />And -- surprise surprise -- the manual is also excellent. Well organized, readable, and complete.<br /><br />I don't think you can go wrong with this puppy!
