This sturdy little guy does really well for my drums and my band's playing/recording purposes. I love the functionality. It isn't too complicated or unnecessary for the aspiring musician, but does the important stuff, like the mids, highs, and lows, and all of the drive and volume knobs and shenanigans work wonders. I am impressed, and would easily buy it again.
