I'm really enjoying this little box.  It was a bit out of tune as expected, but I used a small tapping hammer (like the [[ASIN:B00162SAQ2 Lyman Brass Tapper Hammer]]) to tune it.<br /><br />The vibrato holes work!  For some reason, that amazes me.<br /><br />And the smell is great -- it has the very distinctive smell of East Indian Rosewood.<br /><br />I liked it so much, I just ordered the spruce top version so I can compare the tone of the difference tonewoods.
