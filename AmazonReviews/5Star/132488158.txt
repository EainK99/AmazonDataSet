better specs than most other phones in even higher $ range.<br />very clean.  they don't color the sound.  superb tonal separation.  but on first test, the tonal placement was a touch odd, centering spacial placement of sound slightly behind the ear instead of mid-ear.<br />(have only ck'd to make sure they work, so have not tested with a variety of audio sources.  it may only be the piece of music i used to first ck them).<br />even so, they're a great match to my pro studio desktop monitors i use for recording.
