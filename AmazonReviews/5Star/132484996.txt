I never could afford an expensive leather guitar strap and have had to settle for what I could afford. When I saw this one on the web site, I thought, &#34;Yeah, the price is about right.&#34; - thinking that I was going to get another limp strap made from lower-quality leather. I was surprised. This Planet Waves strap is made from excellent quality leather, thick and sturdy. In fact, it is of better leather than one of my shoulder holsters (and I count on them for my life). Now I'm slightly miffed at myself for paying the same price for flimsy straps all this time. I recommend this guitar strap for anyone who owns a guitar of any style - beginner or pro.
