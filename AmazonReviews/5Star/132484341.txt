I use this stand to hold a calibrated condenser microphone to measure the frequency response and other characteristics of my audio system.  For the bass frequencies, the response measurements are then fed into another device which corrects the response.  The stand works perfectly for this use and I would think it would work for any application which requires firmly holding a microphone.  It seems like a lot of stand for the money.
