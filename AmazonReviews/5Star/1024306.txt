Our professional singing group, Colla Voce, from Columbia S,C was invited to sing in Prague and Kutna Hora in the Czech Republic.  I mounted this on my Nikon D-7100 and recorded the concerts. I did not use the extension piece as shown.<br /><br />I am a semi-professional recording engineer and usually use mics such as the AKG 414 for this type of recording.<br />Though not the same quality as the AKGs the Tascam did a great job for someone traveling with just a DSLR and a light weight tripod.<br />Tascam is the professional division of Teac.<br /><br />Highly recommended
