It's a bassoon reed, and it's medium-hard. I'm not a bassoonist; I bought test for my son. But he likes these more than most which is fine by me. The one issue he had with one of them is that the opening for the bocal was more square than round, but we fixed that with a couple of small rods and a little leverage.
