Put this on my '74 Alvarex 5052, it's a Japanese copy of the Gibson J-200.  The problem is that this guitar has a metal saddle on it, which won't work with an under-saddle transducer; after a little research, I decided to go with these pickups as I had heard good things and the company is the brainchild of Seymour Duncan and Rick Turner.  Sounds great right out of the box, very clean highs and pronounced low end, a touch muddy if I'm strumming with my thumb (as to be expected).  I cut the pickups off the input jack and ran them to a Fishman Matrix Infinity preamp I had, this wasn't difficult at all and gave me a gain boost as well as onboard tone and volume controls.  I would suggest ensuring the glue you use to attach the pickups to the soundboard isn't too runny or it becomes a pain, but otherwise it is a very simple process.  If you don't want to go the under-saddle route, or maybe you're looking for something to augment an under-saddle pickup, these pickups sound great and aren't very expensive.
