The Yamaha synthetic valve oil is the best thing on the market, hands down. I've been playing trumpet for 25 years, and have had this in my case since I found out about it 5 or 6 years ago. I was a long-time Al Cass FAST fan (with a little Blue Juice thrown in for good measure), but this oil is SO much better. Incredibly smooth action, and it doesn't break down nearly as quickly as conventional oil. I've gone weeks without re-applying. My purchase of this bottle was only the third bottle I've purchased.<br /><br />There are two weights of the Yamaha Synthetic: Regular and Lite. I've tried both, and definitely prefer the Regular. The Lite breaks down faster, though it worked well on French Horn. I assume it would also do well on a rotary valve trumpet. The Regular is the way to go for valved instruments, in my opinion, and would probably also be preferable for baritone/euph/tuba, though I don't pretend to have experience to back that up.
