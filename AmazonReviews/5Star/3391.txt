I got this Acoustic Guitar Kit for my daughter almost 5 years ago. She loved it then and she loves it now. She had a guitar teacher that said it was a good learning guitar. She still plays on it and it still looks fantastic. We have moved twice since then and it even traveled well. With 5 kids in the house now one would think maybe it would get wrecked but it hasn't. It is a very strong instrument and forgiving as well when it comes to being tubed. The bag is sturdy and I really think this is a fantastic guitar starter kit and I would buy another one if any of the kids I knew were interested.
