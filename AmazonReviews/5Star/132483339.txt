I am very pleased with this stand for my alto sax.  It is well made and works quite well at home... and then folds up well for travel.  It is well made and sturdy plus very easy to place the sax down when I need to do something else.  I recommend it especially for any sax player that commonly uses two woodwinds during gigs.
