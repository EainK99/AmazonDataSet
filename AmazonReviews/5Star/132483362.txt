Needed to &#34;mic&#34; a violin for our church service.  was using a condenser mic on a stand which worked ok, but the performer had to keep position.  Found this little gem and thought it was worth a shot for the price.  Very pleased with the results, works better then my condenser mic solution (mid priced mic) and much better for the performer.  Both the performer and the audience noticed improvement.  Amazing for the price.  If you are a perfectionist and can spend the extra $170, then go ahead with one of the others.  If you are on a tight budget plug the trigger on this little beauty.  It works as advertise, with a decent and pleasing sound and can't be beat for the price.
