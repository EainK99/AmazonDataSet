I was very impressed with the construction of this case. The interior is way better than what I have seen on other cases. The lining is more of a velvet style, not the short fur style as in many cases. The latches are very good quality too, strong and the case closes and seals very well. All edges and corners fit perfectly. As for the guitar fit, it's a snug, perfect fit for the Schecter Avenger line of guitars.
