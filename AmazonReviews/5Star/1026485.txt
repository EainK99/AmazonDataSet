Perfect in combination with the other parts from Reliable Hardware Company for the rolling cabinet I was building.  Screwed into 3/4 plywood and attached side anchors and recessed latch.  I bought a furniture dolly from Harbor Freight and cannibalized the wheels.<br /><br />The side anchors provided rigidness the cabinet needed.
