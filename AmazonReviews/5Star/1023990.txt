This is definitely a very finely crafted, exquisite instrument. When you open the case the beautiful craftsmanship of both the instrument and the entire outfit is quite evident. Very classy.  I am an adult beginner who has always wanted to learn but is just now getting the chance. I was able to pull it right out of the case, run the bow across the strings and make a pleasing sound come out of it, even with not having any idea what I'm doing. The violin came completely set up and ready to play, rosin on the bow and everything.  My mother, who currently plays violin in an orchestra and played in the Atlanta Youth Symphony as a teenager, was impressed when I showed this to her. She said that when she wanted to upgrade she was definitely going to keep Kennedy Violins in mind.  I received my instrument through their rental program, which is really great if you do not have all the funds up front or want to give the violin a try to see if it's for you before you spend a lot of money. This company was also one of the few that I found that would rent long distance.  I chose this particular model because I wanted one that I could grow with and not feel limited. The quality on this violin is such that any scratching or squeaking due to inexperience can be done away with relatively quickly with proper form & practice. It of course holds a tune very well. The thing that really helps about the instrument being so high quality as a beginner is that you're not constantly dealing with the technical issues that come from lesser quality violins. You can put those things out of your mind and just concentrate on actually learning the violin, which is immensely helpful. And being able to produce good sound so quickly gives you the encouragement to progress.  It's very clear that Kennedy Violins really puts their heart into their instruments, and they also do their best to take very good care of their customers. Highly recommended.
