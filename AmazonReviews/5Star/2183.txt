This is one of the two best plastic soprano recorders available, and is a much better value for the money than less expensive plastic sopranos. The only plastic soprano comparable to it is the 300 series Yamaha soprano. Personally, I prefer the range of tone color on the Yamaha, but this instrument also has a good range of tone color. The great advantage of this instrument over the Yamaha is that there are several pitches which tend to be problematic on all recorders-- even good wooden instruments-- especially the high C near the top of the instrument, and the G# below that-- and these pitches sound quite clearly and easily on this instrument. I would choose it over the Yamaha for any piece involving fast passage work in the top register.<br /><br />There are better wooden instruments, of course, but one has to pay at least $100 for anything better than this. I think it is a great fortune to be able to buy an instrument this good for between $20 and $30 (the price fluctuates quite a bit), and I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wants to learn to play the recorder, or to any experienced player who wants a plastic instrument as a backup.
