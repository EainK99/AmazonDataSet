This is a great classical guitar sling. Great quality. Doesn't scratch the guitar and it does exactly what's it's supposed to do. You cannot take your hands off the guitar or else it'll fall, but that is with every classical guitar strap. Just with the pressure you put on your guitar with your right forearm is enough to completely stabilize the guitar. No issues at all.
