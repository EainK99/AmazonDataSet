I've purchased three other Audio-Technica related headphone/earphone products prior to this one. The Audio Technica ATH-CK303M Earbuds - Silver (bought two of them, they're $23 right now with shipping) and Audio Technica ATH-M35 Closed-Back Dynamic Stereo Monitor Headphones ($69 now without shipping, went up by about $20 since I purchased them like a year ago.)<br /><br />Anyways, onto the review. To be honest, I can't tell a significant difference in music quality from the Audio Technica earbuds I purchased. (For earbuds under $25 their sound quality is very exceptional.) With that said it's only because I know I'm not using them to their full potential. They're professional studio monitor headphones and not specially designed for listening to music on music players (still does that job great though.)  The cord is pretty long but not too long and it's coiled so you can stretch it pretty far. They're really comfortable and you can adjust them to fit a pretty large head (also great for people with a lot of hair.) The thing that sets them apart from the earbuds is that they're professional studio monitor headphones and they're more durable so it's got a better longevity. Other than that, I'm not trying to hate, but if you aren't going to use these for studio monitoring, I probably wouldn't buy it. I'd just go with a cheaper pair of headphones/earphones instead, preferably from Audio Technica. I know they have beautiful potential but I can't tell much difference from the other products I bought from Audio Technica on my tablets or MP3 players. Buy hey, if I decide to do some studio monitoring, I know they'll come in handy :)
