It's definitely a great delay pedal. Has lots of delay modes and it's very easy to configure. Has 3 banks to store your favourites delays, and the taptempo button is very good when you're playing with a band. Worth the Money. The only negative point is that it comes only with batteries, not with an electric power supply. So, if you don't want to spend lots of money with batteries, you will have to buy the line 6 power supply too.
