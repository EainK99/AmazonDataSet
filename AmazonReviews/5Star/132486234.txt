No doubt about it, this Yeti Mic is simply BAD ASS! Most of the reviews has been good on Amazon, and Youtube. I actually bought the Blue Microphones Yeti USB Condenser Plug-and-Play Microphone with On Stage Boom Microphone Stand AND Pop Filter, and after I tried a few test recordings without the pop filter then with the pop filter I was GLAD I got the pop filter. I am probably going to get the Blue Microphones Radius Microphone Shock Mount pretty soon, along with the Auralex MudGuard Vocal Isolator Sound Dampening Foam, Charcoal, because I plan to do some voice overs for my Animations.<br /><br />I did have a bit of a hiccup when my computer running windows 7 would not recognize the MIC. So I went into the control panel - Device manager - Sound,Video and game controllers - Yeti Stereo Microphone ( which had a Question mark next to it) then right clicked on over that selected update driver Software and the problem was fixed.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Mic combo ( you will kick yourself in the face if you do not get the pop filter ) Not sure why some people complained about the bg noise the mic picks up, to those peeps I would say do some research, lower the gain setting, look at your setup, make the Yeti feel at home and it will do the job.
