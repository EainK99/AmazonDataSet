I was using a standard instrument stand before and was looking for a nice looking stand that will make sure my cello is safe, doesn't get scratched and fits the instrument well.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this one, my modern full size instrument fits perfectly, you can feel that even the motion of pulling the instrument out of the stand is totally safe because it's firm cushions holds the instrument very well.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone.
