my friend purchased these picks and after trying them out, i immediately placed an order. the variety and colors are great. however, when i first purchased them, either they got lost in the mail or there was an amazon/seller issue because a week after they should have been delivered, they had not arrived. i did not have a tracking number on the package. after sending a note to the seller, they quickly responded offering to either reship my package with a tracking number or reimbursing me entirely.<br />overall: great picks, great customer service, great buy.
