Although I'm a beginner and can't speak to the advanced properties of the keyboard, I can tell you that they keyboard has a lot of desirable features for a novice. The keys are graded soft touch, rather than fully weighted, but at this price range I don't believe you can find a weighted keyboard anyhow.<br /><br />While the keyboard is 76 rather than 88 keys, this should be more than enough for a beginning student.<br /><br />The keyboard can plugged into a computer using a standard USB printer cable. Note: No power cable is included and must be purchased separately. Also, there is a connection for a sustain peddle, but that is not included either.<br /><br />Also important for a beginner, the keyboard includes an adjustable metronome, which is very convenient. There is also a nice plastic stand built into the top of the keyboard to hold your music.<br /><br />So far this has been a great keyboard for me, no complaints. I had to send one back because it had 2 keys that made loud-ish clicks when depressed, but the replacement sent to me was perfect. Very much recommended.
