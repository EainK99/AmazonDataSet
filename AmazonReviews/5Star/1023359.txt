This bulb REMEMBERS the setting. Another company sells the exact same bulb as this one but that bulb does not remember the setting like this bulb. The bad thing about a bulb not remember the setting is that when you turn it on without using the remote, the light will constantly change colors without stopping. Imagine if you lost your remote control. The light will keep changing without stopping, which can be very annoying to some people.<br /><br />This bulb is different. Even if you turn it on without using the remote control that came with it, the light will still REMEMBER your last setting, meaning that the light will turn on to the color that you last set, without changing colors constantly. For example, if you set your light color to pink the last time before you turn it off, then when you turn it on this time, it will stay as pink instead of constantly changing to different colors without stopping. One more thing - this bulb is also bright.
