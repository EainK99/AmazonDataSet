Bought a new but damaged YTS-875EX Custom w/o case from a pawn shop on internet. Delivered by FEDEX Overnight...big mistake. Bell lip bent, and lower set keys all bent, even when the sax was well packaged in bubble wrap and double boxed. Had a repair man work on it to get the sax into playing shape. He did a great job! It looks and plays like a brand new horn. This speaks to the quality of the material used to make this sax. It's almost as good as my 1971 Selmer Mark VI Tenor which I bought new.  I feel that it's a bit brighter in sound and the intonation is right on.  The key layout is very comfortable and it screams with a G.Lawton 6 Star B or Guardala MBII mouthpiece. The dark lacquer is awesome. It comes with a G-3 neck but I feel it sounds better with a G-1GP neck. It's just a great sax and you can't go wrong getting one.
