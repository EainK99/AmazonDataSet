I purchased this item for my grand-daughter's 13th birthday.  She loved it. Great beginner violin. She had it out, strung, and was already learning to play &#34;recognizable&#34; music.  Our kids said it is well made, especially for a beginner.  It arrived on time...I am very pleased with this purchase.
