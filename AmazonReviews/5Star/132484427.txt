This is a great light.  The clip is strong.  The support is flexible and easily positioned and does not sag with time.  This is good as you will want to adjust the light so it's not in your eyes.  The light is bright enough to spread over three/four sheets of music stretched out on a music stand.  Been used for two outdoor concerts at night, about four hours of use, and have not needed to replace the batteries yet.  These white light LEDs are bright and efficient!  Use to use the &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; type two led lights on stocks, these are great but just don't cut it when you need multiple page illumination.
