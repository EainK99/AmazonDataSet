I don't know about you but i love to have some background noise. It makes it feel like your in the room with me. I do videos on youtube and i talk to my online friend on skype and dolby axon sometimes and he said it is a major improvement. it captures my sound so rich and perfect. But like any mic its good to get a pop filter. i thought i got the stand that goes above my head but a stand is good enough so dont be expecting that. other than that i would buy it again if it broke.
