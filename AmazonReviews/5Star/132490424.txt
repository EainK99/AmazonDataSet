this works for what i need it for; tapping out drums in fl studio.  basically the keys on a midi keyboard don't have that percussive feel to em, so when its time for a drum track, i pull this guy out.  i've found that i have to hit the ABC button to B before it will move to the right octave to be useful with fl studio.  that being said, it works right out of the box, even on my crappy $300 laptop
