Beautiful once installed.  The adhesive backing did not hold, I ultimately use packing tape to complete the installation.  The lighting adds a premium look to the kitchen.  The illumination is sufficient to do most activities in the kitchen without additional overhead lights.  I recommend using the spanning interconnects to route the led strings around corners.
