I bought this pedal because, the pedal that had come with the deumset that is at my church had broken and I was looking for an inexpensive pedal to get the job done. When I got the pedal and took it out the box the pedal was very heavy and strong, this pedal far superseded the playability of any pedal that I've played in the past. It is very smooth and makes doing doubles, and triplets on the bass drum very easy. I recommend this pedal to anyone who wants a strong, durable, and sturdy pedal that will get the job when ever you need it too.
