I scoured the internet to purchase what could be my last keyboard product I want to make sure i give a review that i would be happy to stumble upon. First off the genres of music i spend more time in are analog/dance/electronic/trance/techno/orchestral/symphonic/sound-track/hip-hop/classical genres. I have owned many many keyboards over the years and i will list some of my favorites not in any order... Korg Triton Extreme, Ensoniq ESQ-1, Juno 106, JX-8P, CS2x, Access Virus, JP-8000... I loved my triton extreme because it was a great self-contained workstation with fantastic convincing sound although piano sounds weren't always it strong-point. The UI was intuitive and amazing to use but i sold it 7+yrs ago. I believe this review is best suited to those interested in my genre of music or share a common fondness about the sounds of the above keyboards.<br /><br />I had recently purchased a Korg Krome online without even trying one in person and very wrongly assumed that it was going to just be a next gen Triton Extreme engine. I received it and initially it sounded \\"OK\\"... i mean the sounds seem to have allot of things going on with them FX-wise etc and initially sounded cool but i found shortly after the each sound's initial audition it sounded hollow to me like they were too digital and bloated with accessorry treatment to disguise the fact that the raw sound wasn't that great/inspirational. At first i just thought man i'm getting older and my ears aren't what they use to be. I let this go but i found myself un-inspired by the board and rarely turned the thing on. Later i dug up some of my old triton-extreme files and listened... I realized immediately that it wasn't my ears... The TE sounded amazing...<br /><br />I immediately wished i didn't get rid of the TE and i seriously wished i would have went in and demo'd the Krome and other boards before i bought it. So then I realized i needed to get rid of it and try to find something else as inspirational as my TE. So i did some research and i heard everyone screaming/praising/worshipping Kronos... So i said this is my next board the Kronos... So i went in to guitar center and started dabbling on the Kronos.... I wasn't impressed although pianos were very good to say the least which korg wasn't known for in the past... The engine sounded like my krome which makes sense but all 6 engines sounded like my Krome.. (How can you say u have 6 engines when they all have the same feel).<br /><br />I went thru hundreds of sounds(Programs and Combinations) and none of them felt very inspirational... I tried the board on different monitors too... In the end it seems to me Korg really went all out to integrate digital computer tech into the board and give you more of everything in a physically light-weight package, but in the end the sounds don't have the life i've heard in other boards...<br /><br />So i was like man this sucks... so i reluctantly moved over to the Motif XF and wow... it was amazing... there it was that thick, beefy sound that inspires... sounds that you can feel... So at that point i was really really thinking Motif XF was my next board. I had never even looked at Kurzweil because frankly they were higher priced and they had a stigma about not really giving any focus to my favorite dance genres... So i went home and i got on the internet because i couldn't believe i didn't like the Kronos... So i went to some top sites to find professional level sound setups for the Kronos in the Virtual analog area... I figured i must have messed up in my audition so let me go listen to the best sound setups out there in HD format... I found a HD youtube video with the Kronos doing all the classic synth sounds JX-8P, 106, JP-8000, and tons of others and again i wasn't nearly impressed... Remember i owned the JX-8P the 106 and the JP-8000 so when the Kronos was trying to do some of their trademark sounds it was a digital hollow joke. Hats off to Korg's marketing team for creating such a buzz about Kronos despite a weaker sound engine.<br /><br />So i was even more convinced of the Motif and very convinced that Korg is doing a great job marketing a great technology product that is actually weak in sound generation and people are buying it. While on the net i came across a HD analog sound setup created by art of sound for the Kurzweil PC3K... and i figured i would give it a listen, and i was like what the heck? Kurzweil seriously? It sounded amazing on the virtual analog... So i went on to research this thing and found out about the new KORE 64 expansion which i have now as well. I watched and listened to countless online content reviews/comparison's etc... and i started to believe i was really not giving Kurzweil its due credit and Kurzweil was becoming a HUGE dark horse for me.<br /><br />So i head back to guitar center and sit down to one that had the KORE in it as well.... and man i could not believe it. Every sound on this machine sounds like its a \\"REAL\\" instrument... even the electro sounds don't sound digitiallly generated they sound so real like there is actually a physical instrument out there that plays these sounds. The drum kits... HOLY FREAKING COW... I love studio processing and getting drums right with compression, eq etc is hard enough, but it is terrible when your starting out with weaker foundational sound like my Krome's kits. I would fight with those kits to try to get a convincing kick drum out of the thing and never could get a kick that sounded like a professionally produced kick... Enter the PC3K there are so many kits on here that sound amazing and so many of them need ABSOLUTELY NO ADDITIONAL TREATMENT to the sounds and are ready to record as is and i have never said that about any board... Everywhere i went on this board i was just blown away by the sound. I then researched Ray Kurzweil and now i know why the VAST architecture sounds so superior. The guy was a genius in not only sound by so many other things and his technology has carried over into so many areas (military etc...) Oh and i was blown away by the Program mode only initially.... i didn't till much later learn about the \\"Setup\\" mode which is the same as Korg's Combination mode(Layers of Programs). The PC3K's setups/combinations were drop dead knockouts and reveal the beast inside.<br /><br />Now to the downside... The user interface is very dated and i have to say i loved the touch interface on the TE and they clearly carried that to the Krome and the Kronos... You couldn't ask much more from an ease of use perspective on those Korg boards. The PC3K can sonically do almost anything better than those boards but the interface definitely takes a little bit to get use to after experiencing the larger touch-screens. I do think Kurzweil could learn a thing or two from Korg in this area. But i had to remember the real reason for my search... the sound... if i don't enjoy sitting down with an instrument and feeling inspired it doesn't matter how good the UI is... I didn't feel inspired by the Krome nor the Kronos... I was definitely inspired by the Motif and the PC3K.<br /><br />Needless to say i bough the PC3K6 and while i was also extremely impressed by the Motif XF the PC3K VA engine and the FX engine of the Kurzweil greatly tipped the balance to Kurzweil. I judge effects processors by how much they don't sound like effects, otherwise meaning how well they just become a natural part of the sound and i have never heard a board with such powerful on-board FX similar or equal to those of the best hardware lexicon units.<br /><br />The thing is beautiful... built like a tank... it is the same size as my Krome 61 but weighs nearly 3x the weight of the Krome (Which tells you something). I am blown away sonically from this board's sound as you can tell already. I also believe that re-sale tells you a ton about an instrument. Just to give some perspetive the Triton Extreme was released long ago and discontinued long ago.... however theirresale value has been amazing... I bought mine for $1200.00 new and today 7 to 8yrs later you still can't touch them for less than $900 to $1000. The Korg Krome i bought new for $999.00 just months ago and it dropped to an average optimistic resale value of about $700 in just a few months and the demand was very low. I couldn't pay someone to take it. A musical instruments resale value reflects its true value/contribution in the industry(Supply/Demand)<br /><br />I am now a true believer in Kurzweil and will find it darn hard to consider anything else because of their superiority in sonic engineering. That said i believe they are under-marketed and/or not as cleverly marketed as others to get the recognition that they need with the younger generations.<br /><br />Bottom line if you want a superior sonic machine with a world-class FX engine then you have found it and it also comes with a great sequencer song writing setup although not nearly as intuitive as other current instruments. I do wish they could learn from the Korg UI on combinations and sequencing/song setup and the FX routing UI and/or provide a computer interface to do this equally as intuitive.<br /><br />All of this said the board is so amazing i can't let a clunkier UI keep me from giving 5 stars...<br /><br />I hope this helps!<br /><br />Timy has carried over into so many areas (military etc...)
