The original performance of the cartridge has been restored.  What a great sound!<br /><br />The flexible suspension of the stylus cantilever had decomposed in the original, which had muddied-up the bass.  This is eventually going to happen regardless of how much wear you put on the diamond.<br /><br />With the brush down, counterweight set to 1.7 grams (resulting in 1.2 grams of actual stylus force); tracking is optimal.  This is in an old Technics S-shaped tonearm.  Anti-skate is set at 1.2 grams.  Better to have a little extra down-force than to have the stylus crashing to either side during a loud passage.  You want consistent contact.  It's like not having enough valve spring on a high performance camshaft.  You want adequate pressure to get the thing to follow the undulations accurately (e.g., on a cymbal crash).
