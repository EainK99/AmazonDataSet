I needed a mic for doing camtasia screen casts and the built in mic on my mac was not sounding too professional. I read the reviews on this mic and I decided to give it a chance. I needed a USB mic since the mac doesn't have a line in for a mic, this was a plus. The mic worked out of the box and has 4 settings for different vocal needs. I'm not a professional singer or anything like that but the difference in this mic vs my mac was great. I now find myself judging other people's audio on other screen casts that I watch. You won't be disappointed by purchasing this.
