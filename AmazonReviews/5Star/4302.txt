I've have been playing drums my whole life. And so it is not surprising then that for me is extremely important that the drums were of the highest quality. And as you know, snare drum, is a basic tool for every drummer. And I with all responsibility declare that this snare drum is made for the glory! I like the sound. I was very pleased that the tuning of the drum is easy to configure. And most importantly, on this snare drum, a real pleasure to play!
