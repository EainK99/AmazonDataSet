I really like this instrument. I have never owned nor played a dulcimer before, so this is the perfect price and size for me to learn on.<br />I changed the strings when I received it, and the sound improved immediately.<br />This is easy to tune to notes below middle c and that is what I needed.<br />I tuned it to open g tuning to make chords easier to form. Then I played some of my music in the key of g, using a d instead of d7 because I couldn't figure out how to form 7ths on this.<br />Other than that, it is exactly what I wanted.
