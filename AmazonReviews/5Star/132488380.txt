Disclosure: I was provided with a review sample by the manufacturer.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the size. I have uploaded two customer-supplied images at the top of this page to provide a comparison with my smartphone as a reference. Despite the size the clamp clipped onto two of my guitars (a Squier Jazz bass and an Epiphone Les Paul Junior). It easily fit both. In fact the clamp opens a full 1.75 inches, so this would probably work on a double bass. There is a soft, synthetic pad on each side of the clamp to protect your instrument. That is a nice touch, but I am not sure you would want to allow it to come into contact with an expensive instrument with a nitrocellulose finish. I would personally use a small piece of cloth between the clamp and instrument in those cases. For most instruments, though, it should work fine and not mar the finish.<br /><br />I was surprised that I could read the tiny display so clearly. To be honest the modes were difficult to read when the tuner is attached to the headstock, but the note value and the pointer are clearly visible (even to my 65 year old eyes). Since this tuner 'remembers' the last mode selected when you power it up the tiny mode lettering is not a real problem in my opinion. One feature that I love is the blue screen changes to green when you are dead on a note. That makes tuning quick and highly visual. The scale of -50 to +50 hundredths is a plus for folks who want to drop tune in non-standard way, but in those cases the screen will not change colors.<br /><br />This is definitely designed for stringed instruments because the modes, which you can access with quick presses of the button, are chromatic scale, guitar, guitar flat b, guitar flat bb (the latter two for open tuning and baritone guitars), bass, violin and ukelele. For guitars the note value and the string are displayed.<br /><br />I am fairly sure that this tuner would work with other instruments like a saxophone where you bring it to the correct pitch by adjusting the mouthpiece. I have not tested that, but will and will add to this review after I do. The reason I mention this is this tuner has a range from 27.5 to 4186 Hz, corresponding to A0 to C8. Those are the lowest to highest pitch on a standard piano, so it may not be restricted to just string instruments.<br /><br />Another nice feature is this ships complete. There is no need to purchase a battery because one ships with the unit. Access to the battery compartment is simple. I did have a little struggle inserting the battery, but that is more of a learning curve issue because once I figured it out that procedure turned out to be equally simple.<br /><br />Of course the ability to swivel the tuner to practically any angle is one of the design elements that set this apart from other tuners that clip onto headstocks. And the construction is definitely heavy duty and well thought out. This is easily the most convenient tuner I have ever used and one that I strongly recommend.ct pitch by adjusting the mouthpiece.
