I read many reviews saying that there was a buzzing and feedback from static in nearby objects, however that only happened with one specific lamp in my house. Although wind from outside was starting to pick up at one point, I simply put a sock over the head of the mic and it fixed it. Now the microphone picks me up clearly from across the room, without absorbing the sounds of the wind or fans around it.<br /><br />I really love this microphone, and can't wait to start recording my own stuff with it.
