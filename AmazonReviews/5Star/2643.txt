I LOVE this case.  It's smaller than my previous case, but has more room.  Has a strap for the chin rest so it it's just wedged in or floating around.  I have a 16 inch viola and I had an inch to spare.  The velcro adjuster snugged up perfectly.  There is room for several music books on the outside, and there is a larger area that can hold larger music if you need it to.  Places for pens, pencils, rosin, mutes, and the tuner.  This case is balanced.  So even after adding my books to one side, it doesn't tip over like my previous case was constantly doing.  Feels durable, with thicker zippers and comfortable grips.
