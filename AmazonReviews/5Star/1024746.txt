It is a great upgrade from the cheap stamped saddles that came with my otherwise very nice Stratocaster. The guitar tone has mellowed and is warmer and rounder to my ears.<br /><br />My 2009 MiM strat came with vintage type bridge and stamped steel saddles. It also came with very unremarkable ceramic pickups that hardly sounded like a Strat, so I put in a kit of Alnico V pickups from an American Standard Strat. I had the following problems:<br /><br />1) The guitar became shrill and with a repertoire of unpleasant overtones. The crunch of the alnico pickups was excacerbated by the thin saddles.<br /><br />2) The bridge springs resonated hardly whenever I played an open B note. I was thinking about putting some damping material in the cavity.<br /><br />3) I hated how the protruding allen screws fro mthe saddles where digging an unpleasant hole in the side of my right hand.<br /><br />4) On top of that, I was breaking strings very often as I use bending quite a lot.<br /><br />The black graphtech saddle kit singlehandledly resolved all of these problems. the guitar became warmer, but still with a bit of crunch. The springs stopped resonating, my right palm is much happier since the adjustment screws are now recessed and I stopped breaking strings all the time. Tuning stability was also improved as well as sustain.<br /><br />I like the way it looks because my guitar already had some black pieces like the pot knobs and the pickup covers. I do not like the plasticky texture, I wish it was piano finish like it looks in the ad photos.<br /><br />Iin the end, I can say this kit made my very middle of the pack strat into a totally different, nicer guitar to play and hear. I am very satisfied with that purchase.<br /><br />I understand that some people are not happy with the warmer sound, but there is also a solid stainless steel string saver saddle kit available for these cases that doesn't alter the natural bright sound from the standard bridge saddles (and sounds much nicer than the stamped ones).
