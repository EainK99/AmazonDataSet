This player is the route you want to go - especially if you're a new vinyl lover looking to get good quality sound out of your new vinyl collection.  I've tried several different turntables, and they all sound tinny and do not reproduce midrange very well (sounds &#34;warbly&#34;) - but this one actually sounds great!  While this player is admittedly on the budget end, you still can't beat it as far as overall EXCELLENT sound, and consistency of play is considered.  Now granted, an all-in-one unit is maybe more aesthetically cooperative than this set-up, but I strongly recommend the following if you really really REALLY want to experience a fantastic vinyl sound system for a reasonable price (all these items considered, you're looking at a $350 investment) : (1) You'll need an external speaker (I recommend the Klipsch G-17 Air - currently priced at about $255 as of this writing) and (2) a 3.5mm Stereo to 2RCA Male to Female Adapter Cable adapter (just copy and paste exactly that and search it, you'll find it).  The speaker, the adapter and this ION Profile Player is all you need. You'll be more pleased with this set up than with any all-in-one system you can find. I promise you that. Enjoy!!
