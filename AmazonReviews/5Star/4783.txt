Great for an upgrade from a basic gig bag. Not quite as cumbersome as a normal hardshell case. I like the funky pattern on this one. It is probably an inch of padding/ but the padding is much sturdier than your basic gig bag. I like the handle on top of the bag. All of my sopranos fit - some a little tighter than others (depends on their dimensions). The internal padding blocks are quasi-adjustable too so you can get a precise exact fit. I really like this bag and wish I had purchased these before. Definitely recommended.
