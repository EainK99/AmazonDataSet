I bought this product for my son who is taking percussion lessons and is in a school band. He needed an instrument to practice on. I ordered this particular set because of the reviews. The positive reviews are right on. It has a great sound. They are loud, but that can be reduced with different mallets. The whole family loves playing with it. It's compact. Can take it anywhere. Great carrying case for protection. Glad I got this instrument for practice. It's an incredible price.
