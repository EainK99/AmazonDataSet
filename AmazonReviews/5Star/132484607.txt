Selecting a mouthpiece is a personal thing. I had lost my Bobby Shew  lead mouthpiece and I ordered the Jazz as a replacement. Later I found the lead and was thinking the I had ordered the wrong piece until I played it. It is wonderful!<br />I have better control of my intonation, pitch and high notes. In a word great.
