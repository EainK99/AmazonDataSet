these are absolutely fantastic cases. i own two of the 4U size, each housing about $8k of gear. i've flown with them long haul, and toured with them being rattled around in the back of a truck across europe. i can only say they're tough, and that i feel comfortable entrusting my gear to the airlines (insofar as that is ever possible) with them. ps, it doesn't hurt that they look totally pro. :-)
