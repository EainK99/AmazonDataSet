These work great on my Agile 828 by Rondo Music. If you have an 8 string Agile these are the right size.<br />Or If you have a 2.5&#34; and above nut length this is the ONLY size that will fit. Do NOT get a size large. XL is what you need<br /><br />Don't waste your time with Jimmy clips unless you're using them below a Tune-O-Matic Bridge. For muting the strings up by the headstock, this is your best option
