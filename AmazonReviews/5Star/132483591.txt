This is a well build speaker...for the price you are getting a quality product...is a great speaker for a small room or as a combo or filler speaker...this brand is hard to find and unavailable pretty much everywhere I look...just waiting till they are back on stock to get my second one...I use this with my Youth Ministry to play music at our youth night also at home connected to my tv to get incredible sound...I also use it in my back yard with my portable movie equipment...I bought this not planning to as I needed a 10 for a filler for an event as a rear speaker in the church...I did a great job and excellent sound at mid volume...I clips at the very high end of the volume...I would recommend this product to add to your set in combination to another Deura 10 or to a system with multiple speakers...and like I said to play music or instrument in a small room...
