I A/B'd this against an older traditional cup mute (the old white and red ones from decades past) and it sounded identical to it.  Yeah!  I love the fact that you can remove the cup off of it and turn it into a straight mute.  Again, I A/B'd the straight mute against the old paper/cardboard white & red one and it sounded identical.  This allows me to carry one less mute in my bag!  Very nice!
