Does not work well with a 12VDC power adaptor (these things normally introduce too much noise), but it works great with a 9V battery, or with an external 12VDC (i. e. a large battery).  Perfect if you want to mix a few (4) stereo audio streams, for example from two or more musical instruments.  The unit seems very well built.
