This is a nice distraction after hectic day. This fully lights up a wall about 14 feet away from source and the pattern(s) is easy to see. In dim room light this is a nice &#34;Wallpaper&#34; but in the dark it's very entertaining (hypnotic maybe?). If I light an incense stick, I feel like I'm back in the old &#34;club days&#34;.
