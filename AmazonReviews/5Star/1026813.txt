I own 4 mono cases (2 M80-ADs an M80-AC and a Uke case) and I love them all.  The case is extremely well padded with a great support for the bridge.  The backpack straps are comfortable, I walk over a mile each way to my guitar lessons with no issue.  There is plenty of extra storage and they are definitely as water resistant as they advertise.
