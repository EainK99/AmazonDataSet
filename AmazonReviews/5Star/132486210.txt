I enjoy listening to music and by that I mean listening to all types. Ranging from Alternative rock to classical music. I have yet to hear headphones better than this one. I was on a low budget but I had to get these because of great reviews. I did not like Dr. Dre Beats because I found them to be very similar to standard headphones you could get anywhere. With the Audio Technica, I was very impressed. The bass is very impressive and not so heavy, although you could set your equalizer to bass boost and get that effect. I get a fuller range of sounds of lows, mids, and highs that blow away most of the headphones I have tried. I am an audiophile and if you like to listen to clean sound these are the headphones for you. They are somewhat lightweight and feel very comfortable on the ears and over the head. I would not necessarily use them to walk around and excerise with them but I would definitely use them while I am studying or when I am relaxing on my bed. One of the best features of these headphones is the sound quality and the fact no one else will be disrupted by your music because the sound is sealed in by the headphones. You get to enjoy the music all to yourself. It is as if the makers of this headset where thinking about building a headset made just for you.<br /><br />I am also a musician and use these for my amplifier when I play my electric guitar. Mind you that I mostly play jazz and I am extremely picky with my sound quality.<br /><br />By far the best headset I have ever used. I don't plan on looking anywhere else for a better headphones.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my post. Enjoy these phones as soon as you unpack it. They are worth every penny.
