All my friends work at guitar center and sam ash. They all raved to me about this pack cause you really do basically get the extra crash for free and they sound killer. the brilliant finish gives them a nice crisp overtone and they sound absolutely NOTHING like the B8's (or the ZBT's!) which are really just trash can lids for kids to bang on. These I use in my studio for professional recordings of bands here in NYC and they sound great recorded as well. Do yourself a favor and save $500 and just buy these!!!!!!!!!
