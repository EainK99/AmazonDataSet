Mine came in transparent, fluorescent greenish-yellow color...love it. Made of sturdy, hard plastic. The universal shape fits on my acoustic and electric guitar pegs. This saves so much time and effort when re-stringing, I don't know why I didn't get one years ago. Essential for anyone who changes strings often.
