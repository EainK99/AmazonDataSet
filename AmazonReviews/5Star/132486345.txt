I'm truly a music lover. I can't count the hours iv sat back and listened to album after album. I got these headphones back in 2013, and I'm really satisfied with the sound quality.  First off balance is key, and audio technica is always so professional at creating headphones with that natural sound, while really displaying all sound very balanced ,and equal as they should be with not too much bass ,but enough to know it's there ,and still quite enjoy it. They also fit very comfortably,so soft and nice and very adjustable. Only prob is don't wear em if your going to be sweating, just makes sense ,cause it can cause your ears to get hot, and that can be very uncomfortable and unpleasant,but that's what portable speakers are for. Also since winter is nearing, these will make for perfect ear warmers lol,but yea to me they would only be uncomfortable if i was in the hot sun. Overall i really love em,and they are worth the price,and beat any pair that are 200 and up. I mean,how much better can the sound actually get? I'm satisfied. If music be the food of love,jam on - micky
