*Understand the difference between the Mega Tri-Par Profile, and this item: the Mega Tri-Par Profile PLUS*<br /><br />I have 6 of the Mega Tri-Par Profiles and now 4 of these Mega Tri-Par PLUS uplights. They work well together! However, educate yourself and be informed that this 4-pack of uplights is the NEW for 2015 version of the ever popular Mega Tri-Par Profile lay-flat LED uplight. This matters because:<br /><br />A) These new lights are quad-LEDs (RGB+UV) instead of just the tri-LED's. (RGB)<br />B) These new lights are 4w each, 20w per fixture, the older one is 3w each, 15w per fixture. These are indeed brighter.<br />C) These new lights have different DMX values, so you'll need to independently program them to integrate them into an existing Mega Tri-Par DMX setup.<br />D) YES, these can basically be used as a blacklight, especially if you have all four with just the UV LED on. Indeed it's a blacklight, just not an overly powerful one.<br />E) That added UV LED matters because it allows you more vibrant colors, like hot pink and lime green; those colors don't really work with Tri-LED lights.<br />F) Everything else, the basic design, lay-flat design, size - is identical to the prior lights. (These do take a tiny bit more power..but not an issue)<br /><br />Awesome uplights, very bright. Strobe mode works well, many colors available. From 4-10 DMX channels for programming. Easy linking, get enough and they make pretty much any room look like The Bellagio. You can buy the wireless DMX receivers, the ones that require power, and you're all set because this light has power out - so the light itself can power the wireless DMX receiver. Awesome.<br /><br />Random feature: The menu buttons on the back of these requires you to hold it for about 2 seconds before it reacts; this is great because you know, if you own the other Mega Tri-Pars, that sometimes just a slight bump to a button while moving it and the settings change. Was never a big deal, but annoying. Well, not any more. Seems like nothing, but trust me - it's a nice little feature.le feature.
