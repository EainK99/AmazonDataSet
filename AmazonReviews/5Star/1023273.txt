As a music teacher who is not a fan of  toy musical instruments because of their lack of good intonation and tone quality, I was very pleased to find that this xylophone is the rare exception. It has great tonal qualities and good, solid intonation. At a recent Suzuki summer institute several teachers were shown these instruments and all commented on their quality. We then proceeded to play on the xylophones, harmonizing and having as much fun, or more possibly, than I would envision students having. Parents wanting to introduce their children to a first musical instrument before the commitment of lessons would find this to be an excellent choice. I received this product as a gift and the above is my honest and unbiased opinion.
