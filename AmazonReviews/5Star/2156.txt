Love these and they sound awesome.  I bought two to use with the Monoprice 110951 PA system and the worked great. No background noise was heard through them, just the person singing or talking. Loved that you can turn them off and on, a big plus.  My son-in-law made a nice comment about them and informed me that these are top quality mics and wish he had some like that for his karaoke set up.
