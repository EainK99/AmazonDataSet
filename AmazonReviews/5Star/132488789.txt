This is not an amazing neck for the price, it is an amazing neck period. drilling the different holes in it took a while, but was definitely worth it. the fretboard is so smooth and the whole neck has a great finish. it could be sold for so much more, yet it is a measly little 32 dollars. if your looking for a new guitar neck because of any reason, building a guitar, broken neck, or you want a new neck to replace yours just because, this is the one to buy.
