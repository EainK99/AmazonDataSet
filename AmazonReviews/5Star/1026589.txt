I agree with all the great reviews here.  I play through a PA system at church and the Godin XTSA is superior in sound given its unique electronics with the combined humbucker and the RMC acoustic transducer pick ups.  Each pickup is awesome on it's own but where it really shines is dialing in a combination of the two.  It gives plenty of power and has a wonderful sounding high end that cuts through so you can really hear it over the bass and keyboards.  I can get a beautiful acoustic sound and a great heavy fat sound as well.  I run it through my effects - delay, reverb, chorus, and phaser and it really sounds great .  I cannot say enough good things about this guitar - especially if you are going to run it through a PA, want acoustic and electric without switching constantly, and are going to be playing with other instruments in a loud confined setting.  I have a 66 Fender Jazzmaster and a Gibson SG and the Godin is my primary performace guitar now.
