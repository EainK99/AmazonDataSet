Let me start with what little gripes I have:<br /><br />The uke came in two boxes -- kind of a Russian doll situation where you open one box only to find a slightly smaller box.  The one on the inside said &#34;fragile&#34; while the one on the outside was mostly blank.  The uke was thankfully not damaged in the shipping process, but this struck me as a bit nonsensical and created some anxiety during the unboxing process.<br /><br />As others have noted, the factory strings are complete garbage.  They were satisfying to play at first, simply because I was so excited to start playing, but I quickly replaced them with some nylgut Aquila Concert strings and the sound quality jumped tremendously.<br /><br />Other than that, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product.  This is my first uke, but I'm no stranger to stringed instruments and I can tell that it's very finely crafted.  It feels great, sounds amazing, and with the plethora of tutorials available on Youtube, I can already jam all day with various chord progressions and strumming patterns after just a few short hours of practice.  Despite a different tuning, guitar skills translate nicely as many chord shapes and scale patterns are quite similar.  I imagine this would make the perfect instrument for a beginner.<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying this, just do it. Trust me.<br /><br />Also, I've yet to plug it in to my amp just yet.  I will update this review eventually.
