I've been playing for a little over a year now (it's never too late to start!), and I really like these books. The Suzuki method is easy and painless and the songs are pleasant to hear and play. I love the option of getting the CD with the book--listening to the songs helps a great deal. There's not as many pieces in volume 3 as there was in volume 2 (7 as opposed to 12) but they progress in complexity at a reasonable rate. I'm looking forward to learning from this book and the rest of the series.
