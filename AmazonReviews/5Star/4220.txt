Just received, using in a 2002 Infiniti I35. Works EXCELLENT, paired right away with my droid mini and sound quality in the car is very good. I did adjust the volume on my phone to between half and 3/4 volume to keep the music from sounding blown out and that seems to be the trick for finding the good sound. I think it sounds as crisp as a CD. As for the phone, I made a few test calls and people could hear me just fine. Said it sounded like I was yelling, which I was becuase I wasn't sure how good the mic would pick up my voice. But it picked up VERY well...again I have my phone volume adjusted to between half and 3/4 volume for great sound. If anything changes I will jump in and adjust the review, but after a couple hours use I'm a very happy customer.
