We bought this cello case for our daughter, after having purchased the Tonareli violin case for our other daughter a year ago.  I have seen cello hard cases that cost much more but looked much flimsier.  After buying a brand new cello, we wanted to make sure it would be protected well, and this case definitely does that.  It also has many convenient handles so you have options when toting it around.  The only negatives about this would be that my daughter says it has noisy wheels, and the finish has become nicked kind of easily when bumped.  Over all, I have a very good impression of the Tonareli products and believe them to be a great product for the money.
