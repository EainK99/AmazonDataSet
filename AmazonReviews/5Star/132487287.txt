I use this for a reference when we play, to get the right BPM for songs.  We play many different songs, and I wanted to make sure we're close to the appropriate speed when playing, after we had played a couple songs either too fast or too slow on occasion.<br /><br />Went through and matched up BPM to all our songs, made notes, and at a gig, set this to the BPM from my notes, and play it for a few seconds for guitar player and myself to hear.<br /><br />Works great!
