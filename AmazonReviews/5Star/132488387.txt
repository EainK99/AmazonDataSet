I originally was trying to order the Remo Pinstripes, but after waiting for 1 1/2 months for Amazon to send it to me, and then saying it would be at least another month (they never even contacted me on this until I contacted them), I finally decided to try the Evans equivalent. The sound is great, they look nice, and the durability should be there for awhile. Not to mention, I received these in less than two days, which is what I generally expect from Amazon.
