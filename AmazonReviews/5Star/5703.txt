I took a chance on this, as I'd not heard of Griffin stands, and it was so much cheaper than a Pearl or DW remote hat. I cheecked the company out online, and found that they are a small business based in Texas. Like most remote hi-hats, it's a  bit stiff in feel compared to my regular hats. I do find that it's loosening as I use it more.<br /><br />This stand is built like a tank too - very solid construction. I am definitely going to purchase more items from Griffin.
