Just got it working, sounds great. I think it's going to be a pretty great turntable, but one bit of advice for other people that have never used a belt drive before: at first I thought the motor was a lemon because I couldn't get it moving, but I finally realized I had the belt on the wrong post. The instructions do not indicate that there are two possible posts to wrap the belt around, so it obviously doesn't indicate which is the correct one. You want to wrap the belt on the GOLD post that's slightly higher. I suspect the guy that ordered two that didn't work was likely falling victim to this same snag.
