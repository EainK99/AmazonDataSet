I play tenors in my marching band at high school. I love them because of the fact that they are durable, long-lasting, and are the perfect length for reach and size to get the punch and the tone out of a tenor drum. I love to cross over and sometimes they are a bit too long to do that but I still love them 100%. I have a passion for marching snare and love the feel of them and the fact that they are a whitish color means you don't HAVE to tape them for the visual effect.<br /><br />You did it again, Vic Firth. No surprise.
