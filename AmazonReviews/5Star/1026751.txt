I play 2 Carol Brass and 1 Yamaha trumpets. Carol Brass recommends Ultra-Pure. The &#34;regular&#34; weight is better for everyday use. I use the &#34;light&#34; weight oil for breaking in valves (Carol Brass needs at least 2 weeks of daily cleaning) because it has considerably less viscosity (it is almost as runny as water). The light weight oil does not last as long in my valve casings.<br /><br />If you buy directly from Ultrapure they give you an empty small bottle and 4 tips, which are nice but not absolutely necessary, because the big bottles do come with fold-over caps for dripping (as opposed to pouring) oil.<br /><br />The president of Ultrapure (who also plays and teaches trumpet) assures me via email that TSA (airport security) will allow Ultrapure oil to be shipped because it is not flammable. However I have had trouble with various kinds of fluids in checked luggage on airlines, especially at PDX (Portland international airport), the nearest major airport to where the Ultrapure company is located. Perhaps a large decal emphasizing the safety of valve oil would help security personnel.
