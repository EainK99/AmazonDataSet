The product serves its purpose as a tuner/metronome exceedingly well. It's larger than the Yamaha tuner I typically use, but that's probably due to the fact that it's got a speaker and all the functions associated with the metronome. It's a little bigger than I expected (something like 3&#34;x4&#34;), and might be a tad vulnerable to being crushed in a backpack, so I might recommend something smaller (maybe something without a built-in metronome) for a student keeping it in their backpack who just needs a quick tune before rehearsal. I have mine at home for practicing intonation and timing, and it's pretty excellent.
