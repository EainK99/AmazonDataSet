I have had these tubes for over a month and my Boogie sounds killer.  They were packaged well and got here quickly.  I am not well versed in electronics so I have no way of testing them other than to say they work.  They were far less expensive than GrooveTubes or Sovtek.  Only time will tell about the quality.  Five star rating is tentative.  I am well pleased for now.  I am not as pleased with Amazon's search engine.  They were a pain to find on the Amazon website.
