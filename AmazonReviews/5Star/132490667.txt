I strung these on my Spectorcore bass and their pronouncement was immediate. They fulfilled every audible point that's to be expected i.e. excellent clarity, long sustain, and superb harmonics. The Boomers rank among and alongside the best strings on the market. I have yet to measure their consistency or duration of tone when leaving them on for long periods of time. That should be understandable considering that I'm not the kind of player that changes strings often.
