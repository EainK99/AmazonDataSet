This is a really nice turntable, great for the audiophile smooth playing solid built and for the price this was a no regrets purchase. If I crank the volume up full I can barely hear a hum This turntable is paired with my Yaqin 100B Integrated tube amp. Incredible sounds!!! Also nice it's fully manual with a tube amp this works well since you can't leave a tube amp alone.
