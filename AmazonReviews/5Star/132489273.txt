We had these red and green lazers that I bought on a whim for a party my friends throw annually at Burning Man. considering we are surrounded by world class lazers and progear and lighting techs, I was not expecting the tons of rave reviews and compliments we recieved on our extremely modest set up. It was truly mind blowing how great they look, how far they project, how well they hold up. Would buy again.
