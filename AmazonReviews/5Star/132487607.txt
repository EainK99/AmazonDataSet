Do not allow the fact the headphones are light trick you this are great. They fit well and sound even better the bass is amazing and for me that's great (bass player). Also the twist off adaptor is a great design and quility. I also watch tv and listen to music with so very multi-purpus so if you need some good headphones buy these i've payed more for phones that could not tuch these in anyway but don't go jogging or anything with these becasuse you will only hear music. Sorry for typeos and spelling
