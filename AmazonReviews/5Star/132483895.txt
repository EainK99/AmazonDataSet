For the Price this is a stout Gig bag. I was very surprised.  It's about as well built as my fender bag that cost more than twice as much. I took a gamble and I bought it to fit my Randy Rhoads V. The model has 22 Frets and it fits Snuggly in this bag, but just barely. I doubt it will fit something larger. As stated in other reviews the logo is a little Cheesey, but If that bothers you at this price, cut it off or put a band patch over it. This Bag is good enough to throw on and ride a bicycle, which is what I needed it for. I am very satisfied and would recommend to anybody looking for something to carry around a Randy Rhoads V.
