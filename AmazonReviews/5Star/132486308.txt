9 year old, 6 year old play the drums into the night. The set is an adult set, but as the kids grow up I chose the full size version instead. I got a video how to set it up. The included instructions are black and white and no good. Drums are awesome - high quality. When played at night they are a little loud, but who likes neighbors anyways?
