I play Bari sax in a big band, after a 3 hour rehearsal I do not feel the stree on my neck & shoulders like I use to with a traditional neck strap. I'm a big guy (6'4&#34;) and I do have to say that the jazzlab sax holder is a little small for me, but the fact that I do not have any pain, I can deal with that.Standing or sitting you do not feel the weight of the horn. I will recommend the jazzlab saxholder to my students.
