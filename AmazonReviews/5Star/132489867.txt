I purchased this item because I am currently overseas with the US Army and didnt want to take with me, or send, any of my guitars from home to this tour. This guitar definitely works for the purpose I ordered it for. For the price of this guitar, I was pleased with what I am getting out of it. It sure isnt a $300 or $500 guitar, but it is extremely light, and will still allow you to get the sound you are looking for. Great cheap starter guitar, or in my case, travel guitar that you are not worried about beating up. Service was excellent, they delievered all the way over here within 10 days (which is not very common.) I would definitely purchase from these guys again. Thanks.
