i have already put this to use holding various laptops and even a small Alesis midi controller keyboard. The non slip pad is an excellent and surprisingly useful extra. Feels much more solid and secure than placing my laptop on a music stand, and it's nice to know this would work well as a music stand too in a pinch!
