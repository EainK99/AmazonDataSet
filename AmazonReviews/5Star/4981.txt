I have tried out a few different Bluetooth sets but this one is my favorite. This one is very comfortable in my ears, most sets make my ears hurt or thy just fall out . This pair come with three different sizes and the earpiece has a T-light ear tip to help hold it in place. These are sweat proof, multi pairing and have a great sound. These were easy to pair. There is a LED indicator on the earpiece along with the volume, next/previous track and on/off button. The microphone is also on the earpiece. These have an equalizer adjustment on them that is a nice feature too. They are black and nice looking and I could go quite far from my phone and still had good sound quality. I was given this product for a fair and honest review.
