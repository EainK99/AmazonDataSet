I am very pleased with this ligature.  The reviews here at Amazon were most helpful for my selection.  The one saying it made more difference than a several thousand dollar clarinet upgrade surely caught my eye.  I've paired it with a Vandoren 5RV Lyre, Profile 88 mouthpiece that was recommended by an outstanding source, and I am extremely pleased with my tone after starting to play again after a many year  absence.
