I wanted an Ocarina with a great sound and a small price - no mean feet! Shipping is fast, but be wary of time lost through customs!<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that it holds it's tune through the low and high. It is light, and sized well for hands large and small. Cleaning it presents no huge problem - just remember to \\"google\\" instructions.<br /><br />The pages that come with the ocarina feature basic instructions and tablatures. The songs are varied, though I cannot discern any order to which they are arranged.<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend this for those learning the Ocarina.
