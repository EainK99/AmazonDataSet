I'm a filmmaker and wanted this for doing some audio mixing right away from my editing software, but After I ordered this, I started digging a little bit more over the internet and started to think that this was very complicated to set-up and I started to think that compatibility would be a huge isssue. When it shipped, I plugged the AC power and the USB cable, turn it on, opened Adobe Premiere CC and Audition CC, went to Preferences and activated Control Surface and worked instantly! Remember to press the second button to activate the NC-C mode. It's awesome because I can do so much for so little amount of money spent on it. I would buy it again if I had to, and I totally recommended.
