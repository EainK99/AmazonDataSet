For the price, you'd be hard pressed to find better.  Perhaps my ears are totally average, but I don't have any issues with the buds falling out.  The volume is better than the prior headphones I used, so that is good.  These have also lasted awhile now without losing much battery duration, which again was an issue with my prior set.
