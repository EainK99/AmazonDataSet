I was surprised with the quality of the sound and the distance that it works at.  I'm not a fan of hidden antennas but this one surprised me.  I have 3 of these sitting on top of each other and they are operating at a distance of about 150 feet.  They are in a church and that's a hard place to deal with.  I've used the predecessors to this (PG58 & PGX58's) and have been pleased.  I usually only prefer the SM58 head but these PG58 heads are just as good.  I have to say that these new ones did not let me down.  If I had one problem witth these, I would have sent the rest of them on the wayside and told you to stay away also.  So trust me, these units do work just fine and with excellent sound quality.  Get them while you can at great prices on ebay and Amazon.
