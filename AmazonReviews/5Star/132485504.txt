Very happy with this Reverse Jaguar. Have been playing a standard 34&#34; Jaguar the past year that has been great but has a lot of bells and whistles that tend to lead to buzz, hum, or just too many options. This trimmed down Jaguar is just right as well as the medium scale is a lot more comfortable, lighter than the standard Jaguar, and the frets are just the right size, not too small like a short scale and not too side like a regular scale. The neck is a beautiful thickness, feel, weight, really really nice fretboard. Very difficult to put a strap on on the inner strap peg because it is like a half inch from the neck. Very weird placement. But when you finally get one on and you have to find one that can get on, thicker leather ones will not ever get in there, then it seems to hold the strap in place a bit, which is a bonus. No buzz, no hum, nicely set up and decent strings right out of the box, the bag is great. Probably will get it set up soon just because I changed the strings and a good idea, the intonation up top is a bit off here and there but not bad, but the action is set very low and very comfortable. Great great great! Very happy. Thank you, Fender!
