I have used the Blue Snowball for a couple years and was happy with it. However, I upgraded to the Yeti and it blew my socks off. The fact that you can adjust sound pattern, gain, volume and it has headphone output makes it a winner. Yes, I have used Rode mics and other brands, but this is the best in my opinion, especially at this low price point. In fact, good value even if it was twice the price.
