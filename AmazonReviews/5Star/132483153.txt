I've had these headphones for a year and can tell you they are some great headphones. They cost ~$45 when I got them, now they cost $58 at the time of this writing. I also have the cheaper Panasonic RP-HTX7's which I will use as a comparison. I got those for slightly under $30 on Amazon.<br /><br />I recommend these headphones for someone who will be using these at home for their computer, electronic musical instruments, or studio recording. These are not good for plugging into iPods/iPhones/mobile devices because they<br />1. have an 11 foot (~3 meter) cord<br />2. don't block outside sound very well<br />3. are not exactly a fashion statement.<br /><br />THE GOOD -<br /><br />Sound. I use these headphones plugged into my computer and electronic drum set. They sound great for music, gaming, drumming, and everything else. These are the kind of headphones that will have you noticing all the little details in your music, especially if plugged into a good quality source. The bass is great, Unlike the Panasonics' bass. It's tight and controlled with some good impact and presence especially when EQ'ed. The same could not be said about the Panasonics. They have really weak bass response to begin with, and it sounds very muddy and crappy when turned up. These headphones also have a nice wide sound stage (Where is seems the sound is coming from). Wider is better, you don't want the sound to seem likes it's happening 'inside your head.'<br /><br />Construction. These are sturdy headphones. After a year of abuse (including being dropped and stepped on), these have not had a single problem. The cable is nice and thick, the plastic is tough, and the headband is made of metal on the inside. You can expect this good build quality on all Audio Technica products. They Panasonics, on the other hand, are pretty flaky. The driver on the inside the the 'phones came loose and I had to take it apart and glue it back.<br /><br />They come with a 1/8 to 1/4 inch jack adapter. Handy.<br /><br />THE BAD - (noticeably shorter!)<br /><br />Sound Isolation. They don't block out external noises or keep your music in very well. When I took these on a road trip (bad idea), everyone in the car could here my music. The Panasonic headphones isolate much better than these.<br /><br />Comfort. These headphones leave my ears hurting after an hour of use. They press down on my ears because the earpads are not thick enough. I've tried getting 3rd party pads (Auray Deluxe Velour Earpads), and they helped a little but didn't really cut it so I sent them back. The Panasonics also take the lead here, I can wear those for hours without feeling anything.<br /><br />One thing to note, they have a pretty flat frequency response (how much low range, mid range, and high range there is. Flat means they are all balanced, which is a little more of a boring sound. With bass and treble turned up, it makes the sound seem more 'alive'). So if your device doesn't have a good EQ, like iOS devices, you might want to consider something else.<br /><br />The point I'm trying to make in this review is that these headphones are not for you if you are going to be moving around or travelling. If you are, you should get some portable headphones. These headphones are intended for people who are going to be sitting/standing still, and are great for those applications.<br /><br />Last paragraph--time for me to completely contradict myself (sort of). The price has risen about 15 dollars since I got them a year ago, so at this pricepoint you might want to look into something else if it aligns to your needs better. However, they're still great headphones even if not as good a value as one year ago.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
