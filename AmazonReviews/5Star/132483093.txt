If you bend strings... this is a must have. Normally when you bend, most nuts not being perfect, hang up or bind the strings return from a bend. This little devise alleviates this binding! I have it on tree guitars. You can buy guitars with this already on, OR, you can get them here and put them on with a little effort and knowledge! I love mine and use the all the time!
