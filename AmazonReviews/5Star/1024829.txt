I have a cheap Bridgecraft &#34;P bass&#34; style bass guitar that I got for free and the only thing it needed was replacement of a tuning peg that had a slight wobble to it that was causing some buzzing in the string. I found these tuning pegs that looked similar and super cheap and they are almost an exact match. I reused the screws from the original peg since those already fit the holes perfectly. The only issue was that one of the four holes in the tuning peg mounting bracket didn't line up with the existing holes so I just screwed it into the headstock making a new hole. For the price, not to mention prime shipping, this was a cheap easy fix and now I've ft three spares. They were exactly what I needed and I would imagine they would work for any fender/squire bass or any knock offs like my Bridgecraft.
