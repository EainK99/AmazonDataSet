I've had MDR-V6's for over 14 years for DJ'ing purposes and set out on a misson to find a suitable replacement as I was starting to look like a hobo when playing gigs. All the pleather had almost completly worn off the headband, the earpads had been replaced 3 times, the cable going to each earpad was a lil crimped and every night I was left with black flecks all over my shirts/face .. however still working like a dream (yes they sound SOOO much better after a few hundred hours burn-in).<br /><br />So after buying (and subsequently selling) oodles of pairs of \\"modern\\" earphones I literally could not find anything sub $200 that could touch them for both studio and live work - they literally tick EVERY box, including portability and when I saw them on Amazon for $77 I just bit the bullet (again)... and my old friends return.<br /><br />.... SOME of the headphones I tested against:<br /><br />HD25 - these are a million times more comfortable for long hours, soundwise however on-par IMHO.<br />Audio Technica ATH-50's - Felt like comparing a Galaxy -S to an Iphone 4, Mid / top end was horrible.<br />Marshall Majors - In a NON-A/B test the Marshalls actually sounded Decent, and I bought a pair on a whim - A/B tested at home and sold them a week later<br />Marshsall Studio's - Sounded Nice until I did a comparison.<br />Pioneer HDJ500's - Probably the biggest TURD in the bunch, these felt like I had actual pieces of vinyl stuck to my ears and were wayyyy too big<br />TMA-1's - decent except for the size was huge on my tiny head and have quite an exaggerated bass end.<br /><br />In fact the only headphones that really shined in comparison were the Superlux 661's for $30, which almost sound identical and I probably would have bought a pair except they didn't fit my head properly and the pads felt yukkie !!<br /><br />Some people will complain about the cables being non-replacable, well in this department sony got it right, becuase the cable will never NEED to be replaced itsseriously tough and been through the wars, however I'm going to modify mine with a shorter straight cable for DJ use !<br /><br />I would go so far as to say the only headphone that I would consider using if these ever get stolen/eaten/run over by a car would be the MDR-1 which have almost exactly the same sound characteristics and are a better looking headphone - but for $230 more !!
