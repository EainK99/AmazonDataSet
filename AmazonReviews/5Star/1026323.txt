*I received this product at a discounted rate solely for the purpose of trying and reviewing this product. All unbiased opinions are my own.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I was very pleased with this iPhone and Apple Watch stand. With &#34;Aircraft grade Aluminum&#34;, this product is a lot stronger than the other plastic stands on the market that I have tried. It even comes with a slot for the Apple Watch charger, so that you can charge both your iPhone and Watch on this stand at night. Every point that comes in contact with your devices is covered in padding, so that you can ensure that your devices will not get scratched. On the stand, the iPhone is placed at a nice angle for watching on demand TV, and the stand is wide enough to fit an iPhone 4 with a thin case, so it will definitely fit newer iPhone models.<br /><br />Overall, this iPhone and Apple Watch stand has definitely earned its 5-star rating from me. If it didn't for you, then try contacting customer service because this product comes with a 3 year warranty!
