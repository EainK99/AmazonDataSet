I have had this item for a month and use it several times a week for lectures as I am struggling with a vocal cord that is not working well.  It has worked perfectly each time and without any fiddling or feedback.  I set it up - plug it in - grab the mic and talk.  SImple as that.  I can speak in a normal or even soft voice and be heard in a lecture hall meant for 100+.  Has been a godsend for me!
