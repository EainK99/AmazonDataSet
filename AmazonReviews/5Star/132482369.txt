This is a perfect size accordion to learn to play on or have something small and portable to play. It's good quality and well made and will last a long time if treated like an accordion and cared for. The only problem I see is the price. It's just too expensive. I have had one of these for a year now and it's great, no problems and still as new. I have progressed quite quickly and wish to sell this one now to a good home.
