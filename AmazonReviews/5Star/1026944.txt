I have this behind my head, and I am able to bend it forward so that I can comfortably look up at anything I am watching.  GREAT.  If I had one wish for this, I would wish it had a foot longer of a gooseneck.<br /><br />But this is what I had hoped it would be!  One thing:  remember to HAND TIGHTEN the alignment screw, before you ratchet the base tight.  I saw a review complaining about wobble, and I'm sure it was because the screw wasn't hand tightened first.
