I received a pair of these free when I purchased a turntable about 10 years ago.  I found them comfortable with good sound and used them at least weekly for the last ten years while doing my radio show.  When my old pair broke a few weeks back, I immediately looked for an exact replacement and was happy to see the same item number still available.  The new item is slightly different.  Instead of a straight quarterphone jack, these have an L shaped jack.  The included quarterphone converter screws on over the sony jack so it doesn't pull off or become easily detached.  I like that a lot.  My original had only a quarterphone jack.  The cups seem slightly smaller and deeper than my original pair but the sound is fine and outside noise is well dampened.  I have used them for several weeks and I am very happy with these.<br /><br />Two caveats for new owners.  After 10 years my old pair began to lose the thin black coating on the cups leaving black spots of plastic on me.  Also, be careful to close up the extenders when transporting or storing.  They are just plastic and could be easily broken if abused.  However I was not very careful with my first pair and they still lasted 10 years.
