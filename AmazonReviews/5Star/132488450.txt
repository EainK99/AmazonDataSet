I've been playing trumpet four about 15 years and have had the chance to use a variety of mutes.  The Wallace Studio Trumpet Practice Mute is one of the finest mutes I have used yet!  My objective in purchasing the Walace mute, was to move away from the Yamaha Silent Brass System.  The silent brass system provided to much resistance, requires batteries, and wires were all over the place.  The Wallace mute was freeblowing, had a great weight and feel, seemed very durable and well made, offered adjustment settings on the resistance, and really reduced the volume (ie, the main objective right?).  I'd say the Wallace mute aforementioned will reduce the volume of your horn to that of the Silent brass system.  In the retrospect, I can't see how you could justify the purchase of Silent Brass when a mute like Wallace's exists.  This mute sold for approximately $65.00.  A quick search shows Silent Brass retails around $100-$125 today.  Why pay extra for a bunch of wires, a plug on the end of your horn, and a clunky console when you could get a mute a fine as Wallaces?  Hope this review helps my fellow trumpet players.  Cheers,
