This amp will not disappoint you with sound, I am a DJ and just set this up with the seismic 15's in place of duel 15 Vegas and the sound quality is awesome with no lack of power.<br />I will continue to by seismic brand equipment , another local DJ helped me set this up and was amazed . I have used peavey also and love this amp much better.
