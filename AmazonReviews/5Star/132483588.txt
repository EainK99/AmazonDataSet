In computer technology, cheaper is often better.  When it comes to USB-MIDI adapters, my unpleasant experiences have taught me that this is NOT the case.  Cheap cables invariably cause problems ranging from not working at all, to high latency, to mysterious dropping of information (particularly SysEx messages, which the cheap cables always seem to drop even if they otherwise work).<br /><br />This adapter costs more, but it actually works correctly.  You won't spend hours trying to pin down mysterious behavior only to determine that, once again, it's a dodgy cable.  You'll just have a proper MIDI connection to your equipment.<br /><br />In terms of compatibility, I am using this on Mac OS X 10.8.5 with no problem--the Roland driver installed properly and works fine.  This model also works with an iPad, but you'll need an extra connector.  For the older dock connector iPads, it's the Apple Camera Connection kit; I'm not sure what the analogous device is for the newer Lightning connector models.  Roland does suggest using the cable with a powered USB hub instead of directly connected to the iPad.  I've not experimented with this enough to know if it's a big issue or just a concern with battery usage (as the iPad would power the Roland adapter in a direct connection).
