Fantastic tuner.  I bought one of the PolyTunes when they first came out and was blown away by the ease of checking the tuning of all six strings with a single strum, and how easy it was go from there to the identified out-of-tune strings and easily tune them individually.<br /><br />The PolyTune 2 supposedly provides increased accuracy, and also offers a strobe-like function, which allows for even greater tuning precision for users accustomed to that approach.  I tested its accuracy using my Peterson Strobe Tuner - a very accurate tuner - and the found the Polytune 2 to be right on target across the board.  Finally, while the red/green lights of the original Polytune and regular Polytune 2 are plenty bright in their own right, I really like the blue/white combination even better.  Best pedal tuner(s) I've ever owned (for the record, I was a dedicated Boss TU 2/3 guy for many years until I came across the PolyTune line but today my second choice after the Polytune would be the Korg Pitchblack line).
