This is my first real headphone purchase, and I'm thrilled with it!  Audio quality is phenomenal - very true reproduction of whatever you're listening to.  I was surprised that the red parts of the headphone are plastic and not aluminum, but construction feels solid.  They're also a little smaller than I had expected.
