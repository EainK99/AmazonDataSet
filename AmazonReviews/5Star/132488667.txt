Relatively easy to put together...need clamps though.  Give yourself time to build this project, between gluing sanding and finishing, it is going to take a few days, so give yourself time.  And get a sanding block, it will help with the edges because you want them well rounded specially around where the contact is made on the legs.  I stained a line across where the sound partition is so that I know where to hit.
