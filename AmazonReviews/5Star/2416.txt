I purchased the khaki model two months ago (same bag, different color). In that time I have taken it to eight jams and on over thirty gigs and the bag has held up wonderfully. This one is perfect for female drummers (and more than a few show up at jams in my local area). That statement is based on the color. The design is for any drummer, and especially we jazz drummers who do not need a bag full of spare sticks.<br /><br />It holds just enough. The interior is lined, and the pockets are divided into a pair that have clear plastic on the back that is good for sticks, mallets and brushes, and a mesh pair of pockets in front of those for items like drum keys, additional sticks, mallets and brushes, and other small odds and ends. I have mine populated with two pairs of sticks and a pair of mallets in the clear plastic pockets, and a pair of brushes on one side and a drum key on the other in the mesh pockets.<br /><br />A big plus is you can hang this off a floor tom without affecting that drum's resonance. I own some high end, leather bags and while those look cool, they have a noticeable affect on how my floor tom sounds. this one does not.<br /><br />Every seam is nicely stitched and the nylon zipper is smooth. The fabric itself is either synthetic or cloth that has been treated because there is a slight chemical odor when I first opened mine. That goes away after a few hours, and the fabric is water resistant because of either the composition or the treatment (I am not sure which, but I view it as a major plus either way.) There are also reinforcement points that appear to make this a sturdy and long lasting bag.
