Dano type lipsticks. THese are the same size but they are not the same mounting style. The Danos have mounting from the back. With these you will have to drill holes in the top for the screws to go down into the brass pickup mounting flange. If you don't want to mark up your vintage Dano don't get these. Other than that they are great sounding - jangly, clear, low volume. I wired mine in series to get more power when using two.
