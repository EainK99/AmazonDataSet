I have the Cannabis Rex in three different amps, a Fender Blues Deluxe, a Fender Deluxe Reverb, and a Mesa Express Plus 5:25. Sound is a matter of taste but, for me, it's simply the perfect guitar speaker. Everyone says CR's need to be broken in. It's true that they get better with age; but they also immediately improved every amp I put them in. The Cannabis Rex tamed highs in the Blues Deluxe and the Mesa, and gave the Deluxe a great deal more headroom. They are smooth across the frequency range.
