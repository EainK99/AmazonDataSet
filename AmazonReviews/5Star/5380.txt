Great freaking mics. After testing these, I was in awe that all 3 together were $35. These things are crystal-clear and any muddiness can easily be fixed with a little EQing. I recommend these to anyone with any type of budget, high or low. These honestly cancel out more sound than a lot of other name-brand mics I've used playing shows. Just, wow.
