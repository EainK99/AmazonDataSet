This sticker has been on all of my son's violins and has greatly helped him with playing.  The various colors indicate where you place your fingers for playing of notes and it's very accurate.  His teacher liked it so much, she recommends it to her other students.  It's much better than the strip of tape which was initially put on his first violin.  That left a sticky residue and shifted.  Don't waste time with tape, buy Don't Fret and you won't!
