loving it so far. got mine used in mint condition from guitar center for $40. I think the sellers here are asking a little much for a used piece of equipment. it is very basic with two channels (left, right) and two knobs. one for lo contour (low frequencies) and another for process (mids and highs). getting some white noise generated by mine but that could be a lack of a power conditioner.<br /><br />update:<br />furman power conditioner cleaned up the noise, the maximizer is still going strong 3 months after purchase. love how it makes my DJ rig (2 600w harbinger mains with a Rockville 2400w stereo sub) sound.
