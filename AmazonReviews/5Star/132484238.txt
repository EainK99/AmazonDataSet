I love my new baby uke. The ukulele came in the expected shipping time and everything came in good condition. I was mostly surprised at the tone quality ( mostly because it came with Aquila strings!) It had a nice echo vibration sound. The feel of the neck and playing it felt very comfortable. I had a Soprano uke first, and it was alright. This is a major quality upgrade. I would definitely buy more of these as a gift for friends.
