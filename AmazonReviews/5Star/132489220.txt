This mando ships with the strings on and the bridge off.  It only took a few minutes to setup and intonate the bridge, and then I was floored by the sweet tone!<br /><br />I couldn't find any flaws in the build, the finish, or even the setup.  The bridge was well fit to the arched top, the action was nice, and the neck relief seemed perfect.<br /><br />I'm really impressed by the looks, the build quality, the playability, and the tone.<br /><br />As an amateur instrument builder myself (a couple of ukes and guitars), I had to poke around inside too.  Nicely X-braced top, and very clean work inside -- no glue slop or rough work.<br /><br />The box included the mando, a fairly nice hard-shell case, and an Allen wrench for the truss rod.
