You'll usually have good luck with Yamaha equipment, and this board has been no exception. I like to use small boards both in my home studio and playing live, and the MG102C has worked well for both.<br /><br />I got this board to replace a simple Behringer board that I liked a lot, and I like this one just as much if not more. It's solid and travels well.
