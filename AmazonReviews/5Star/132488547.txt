So good I've bought a couple more as back-ups. For the price you can't beat it.  Speaking of-the beating karaoke mics take these have held up very well!  And you get two mics so you can double the pleasure. I experimented with a lot of inexpenisve mics that were junk-certainly feel lucky to have scored with this Nady.  Still using the first set I bought 8 months ago.
