I bought this for my seven year old grandson.  Overall the set works<br />very well, the only objections I wish the stool was more adjustable, as<br />he grows we feel we will have to purchase a different stool long before<br />replacing the drum set to a larger size, also the cymbals keep needing<br />adjustment but for the price of the set we feel this is a very minor thing.
