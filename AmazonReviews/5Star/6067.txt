The best rosin so far , at least for this season. I have many different rosins (kolstein, jade, carlsson ) and I have tried many others. Nyman is similar to Carlsson, but is softer, more effective and it sounds a bit more mellow. Kolstein is quite good also but a little bit more powdery. Jade is very hard and I never quite understood its qualities. The absolute worse I ever tried (and threw away after 2 days) is Pop''s , it's good for nothing.
