From the moment I plugged this keyboard in, I was amazed at how many features were at my finger tips. I began by operating Ableton Live and using a combination of both the midi keyboard and the switches for music composition. Instantly, I was inspired. The Launchkey Mini made it so easy to sequence my playlists and effects. The launch key mini was also used on my online podcast to sequence effects, music playlists, and segways into the podcast. On top of using the Launchkey Mini on Ableton, I was easily able to use the Launchkey Mini on Pro-Tools' midi function.<br />As a composer, engineer, and educator I believe that the Launchkey Mini is a vital multi-tool for today and tomorrows DAW.
