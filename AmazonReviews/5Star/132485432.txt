This is my fisrt cello and I am a beginner. My teacher told me that it is fine manufactured and excellent sound. The cello arrived in perfect conditions. The bow is not so good so I bought a Pernambuco wood bow. Perfection pegs allow an easier tune. The case is light and good quality. I am very happy with my first cello.
