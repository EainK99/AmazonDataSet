This light comes with everything you'll need to go. You can use the included batteries to go mobile, or use the wall plug and USB cable if you're going stationary with it. The light is massively bright and makes anything easier to read. The gooseneck is flexible and holds the light in position well if you are leaning it forward. Trying to mount this to the side of your stand, however, won't yield the results you want as the light will keep drifting down. The clip is just the right size for a music stand or desk clip, but can also be used as a base if you want to just stand it on a table or desk. The on/off control is a touch button on top of the light that responds well with a light touch.<br /><br />If you are looking for an unobtrusive way to light your music or reading material, this is an excellent choice. It's very lightweight and the LEDs really light up the immediate area under them. The price makes this an excellent choice.
