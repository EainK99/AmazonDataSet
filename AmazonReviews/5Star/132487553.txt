I have a family member who like musical instruments and I remembered the Hugh Tracey Kalimba from my youth.  I loved the show Wait a Minim and played the album over and over.  A friend gave me a Kalimba in the 70s and I thought it would make a good gift in 2013.  I was pleased that it was still on offer and by all accounts the recipient was delighted to receive it.
