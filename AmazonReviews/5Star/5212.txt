I can't believe people are knocking off stars for color, when does anything you order online look 100% the same?<br />SEE PIC!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Amazing sound quality from pickups (Fantastic metal/gain). I can't stress this enough, sounds the same as other $600 guitars I've owned.<br />2. Solid Construction (no 'cheap' feel to it at all).<br />3. I even like the factory nickel plated strings, I bought new string when I got the guitar thinking they would be bad.<br />4. PRICE! $99 with free shipping???? How could anyone rate this less than 5 stars?<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. In some very very minor areas around the guitar body, there are light imperfections<br />2. Yes, the color of mine was a dark natural/cherry black color (not full black like others have claimed).<br /><br />Hope this helps out!
