This product is great. It makes the front of my new Martin acoustic look better than the day it came home. It smells nice; a bit fruity. I have not tried it on the satin back/sides because I don't want them to get glossy but I cannot say if it would or would not do that. But this is far better than the Gibson spray for my particular guitar.
