So this one was an unknown to me, but at the price point I got a really amazing guitar and hardshell case. The finish is really cool, a tobacco color, satin finish give this one some real personality. The rosette, body and neck are all bound in maple! The tuners, Grover open, old style and tune super smooth. I have to say, I'm very pleased, this one is a real winner!
