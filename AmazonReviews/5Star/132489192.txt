This is a very solid stand with a well-designed base that is easily able to resist a little bump from any direction without going over even with my HW custom Jos.Monke horn. IF you want to be very attentive and place the valve section above one of the legs it is at its strongest. The little white top you see at the tip of the cone is of a hard rubber that protects against accidental dinging or scratching, nice addition to protect your investment.<br />The degree of tilt required to knock the horn over is unlikely to be achieved with an inadvertent bump or missed grab.<br />Best trumpet stand I've ever used. Lets always be careful and buy good products for our babies.
