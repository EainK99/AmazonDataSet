Really happy with my DR-2d, all the advertised features work without any caveats, it's a nice design, easy to use, relatively compact, good sound, good feature set. The main thing I would improve is the battery life, but then it takes only 2 AAs so it's no problem to carry a spare set or two if necessary, or just use the DC in jack for non-mobile recording.<br /><br />The little rubber feet on the back are a nice touch as they give a firm grip on a desktop when connecting to a PC.<br /><br />The only issue I have is I have to turn the gain right up for very quiet recordings (e.g. clock ticks) and this produces noise in the recoding, not really a failing of this unit though, I think I just need to source a good external mic for really quiet recordings.
