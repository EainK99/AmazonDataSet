I have had a EMG DG-20 (David Gilmour set up) in a strat for many years now and have always loved it. However, it was old and required some new parts. Instead of replacing parts, I decided instead to completely update the guitar with EMG's new solder less wiring, new EXG and SPC tone controls and I thought that it would be interesting to try EMG's new pickups, the X series.<br /><br />The SAX pickups sound great. They have more headroom than the original SA pickups and I think they sound warmer. The clarity and response of these pickups are amazing. This updated pickup with it's new preamp cuts right through the mix and doesn't get muddy.<br /><br />The deal and service that I received were fantastic! Five Stars!<br /><br />Thanks!!!
