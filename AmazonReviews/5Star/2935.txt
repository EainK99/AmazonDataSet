This Ampeg is perfect for me. I play it through a SRW little Henry 4X8 speaker cabinet. I use it for both guitar and bass. For guitar I use a DOD distortion and a TC reverb unit. For bass, I just plug it in and don't have to make any adjustments at all. This little amp sounds just as good as the $1000.00 80lb Ampeg SVT head I played back in the 80's.
