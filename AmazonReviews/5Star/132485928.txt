I uses the device for a TV that does not have a volume control for the headphone jack.  The device is small and fits perfectly behind my TV. It uses very little power. The box and the transformer that plugs into the outlet are cool to the touch, so I can leave it running.  The sound is as good as it is straight from the TV (stereo).
