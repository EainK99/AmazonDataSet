Hard to get excited about a power strip, but this is one fine no-nonsense item that delivers on noise reduction, makes all the rest I own feel like dog toys.  This thing is a metal-cased brick that will not brick your electronics.  Would complain the power lead is too long, but am sure that helps more folks than it hinders.
