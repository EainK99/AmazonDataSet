This is a really great drum... well made, high quality skins and wood, and a great buy.  I love the sound...it seems brighter and more focused than my mango wood naal, very noticeably in the low tones, which have incredible sustain.<br />For thousands of years Dholak drums have been the drum set of the old world, with the bass on one side and snare on the other, and are the father of the modern Tabla set, the Cuban Bata and the Dominican Tambura. They are easy to play in most dance styles, even rap (no joke, check Youtube...) and though mastery requires specially developed skills, don't feel that, as a westerner, one wouldn't know where to start...if you play drumset you will take to this drum with ease, and they are so much fun to play!<br />I got mine at the blemished price, but there was nothing really noticeable, and it arrived a week before the earliest delivery date. Many thanks to SG Musicals for a great drum and great buy!
