I bought this for about $280 6 months ago and it was the best mixer for the money. But at nearly $200 more now, there may be other options out there for you. However, this is a very excellent, no frills mixer.<br /><br />Well built product. Hamster switch (or Reverse Mode Mixing) was a big draw for me for scratching and being able to change the slope of the fade is nice when I'm mixing.<br /><br />I love the simplicity of it. I'm just having fun with DJing and if you're looking for something that's going to last you at a good price, this is it.
