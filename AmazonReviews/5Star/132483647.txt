I have been a professional musician for many years. I have used tuner pedals and I even have a built-in tuner on my amp's pedal board. I think this tuner is better than all of them! It easily transfers to any guitar or bass (or any instrument that has a neck)...simply clip it on and pick the string in question. It works great and the LED screen can be seen easily on even the darkest stage. I have bought several of these items. Great deal for the price! Highly recommended.
