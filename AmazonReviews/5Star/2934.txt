I own a Traynor YCV40WR amp. It is a 2009 model. Let me tell you this is a wonderful amp to own. I have owned Fender pre CBS 1964 and 1965 amps which are super amps to own. If you close your eyes and did not know you were playing through this amp on the clean channel you would think I was playing through a Fender amp. What a sound!!!. When you use the foot pedal you have two channels of gain that can sound like a Vox amp or Marshall amp. You can really mix up the different sounds. I play MiA 2014 Strat with custom shop fat fifty pickups. WHAT A SOUND! This has the Vintage 30 speaker. This is half the price of a Fender super sonic 60 watt amp with the same speaker and the Traynor can go toe to toe with this amp and tone tone tone! Try one out. You will buy it!!! Money well spent&#62; Alsp Traynor makes an amp cover that is super.The Red Wine really catches your eyes. The music group RUSH uses these amps.If that tells you anything.<br /><br />Steve
