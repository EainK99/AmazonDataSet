The most underrated yet the most productive and quality headphones you can mind in the market today. Considering this one is only worth $77.95, it is very cheap but worth. Worth way better than Beats which are no lesser than $199, which is pretty idiotic because of the price and the hype about it is very laughable. Beats are too overpriced overrated honestly because Beats are nothing but a trend thing and that's why you see people walking around with those. Beats doesn't even come close to the sound quality and comfort to Sony MDR-7506. These headphones were actually first released in the early 90s and I remember we used to have these at my old house when I was a little kid but back then I was little and stupid so I had no idea about. We ended up giving these phenomenal headphones to my dad's friend's family....I know sad story but I'm glad I found these headphones again and I'm happy that I was reunited with this spectacular piece of technology once again. Imho, the best headphones on the planet and I highly recommend this one to anyone who's unsure about buying a quality pair of headphones. Trust me you'll love it.
