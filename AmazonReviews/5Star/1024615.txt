Good quality for a great price,  you have a variety of sticks that you can order with this stick bag.  .  The bag holds 8 pair of sticks comfortably with two extra pockets,  one smaller inside, and another larger one outside.  Will come in handy carrying all my sticks and equipment.  I pared it up with a Kaces snare drum back pack.  Nice be able to not have so many loose items to carry around.
