They are great headphones for more than just drumming. My uses: Live shows, practicing, home audio use on the computer, mowing the lawn/weed waking, etc. The build is good except I did have my first pair break and cut my head. They broke were the adjustable metal slider meets the plastic ear cut part. The plastic split. However Vic Firth sent me one in replacement. I am very happy with these. And the audio quality is exceptional for the cost!
