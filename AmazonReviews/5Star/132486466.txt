For the price, this bag is outstanding! Easily could charge much more. The build quality is excellent protection, my MOKU select soprano fits like a glove, and the padding has to be 20mm, cause it's thick with a shoulder strap and nice sized front pocket:) Very pleased with this case! Highly recommended if you can get one, you won't be sorry:) Happy Strumming, Aloha and Mahalo
