unless you are playing 78s this turntable does everything you need it to do, and without a dedicated receiver. Pop this into the auxiliary input on your iPod dock and it's ready to go. For the price this turntable sounds phenomenal and is a no brainer, even playing through my inexpensive speaker dock. If you are recording your records, this will go straight into your computer as well with a 3.5mm cord. No need for the more expensive USB unit.
