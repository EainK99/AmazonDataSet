This is the best choice for active Pickups on a bass,<br /><br />I tried a ton of the VHF and UHF wireless systems and I could not find one that didn't either cut the frequency response on the lower end or have a weird annoying hiss when you played an open string, or cutout 5 feet from the transmitter. I tried the Audio Technica ATW-1101/G and I was blown away about the response, and the sound from the low end, it sounded as good as having a direct line and I could walk over a 100' away without issue, probably further but I did not see the reason.<br /><br />The only concern is the battery life on the receiver, I have not had it long to see if it is just the batteries I have or that I keep forgetting to turn the receiver off. I am estimating that there is about 8 hours of continuous use without an issue.<br /><br />Seems to handle active pickups without an issue as well, no interference and crystal clear sound.
