This is very pretty and does make a nice soft sound.My 2 yr old nephew likes to shake it and shake it. It doesn't get on my nerves like a whistle or those other loud instruments for kids do .It's easy for them to hold and is durable so it won't break if they do drop it. My 3 month old grand son is amazed by it. he starts to smile when he hears it. It is made out of wood but you don't have to worry about splinters. It is so smooth.I was playing with it to, there is many different  ways to shake it ,to make different sounds. Me and the kids love this item.I DID RECEIVE THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT  PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW
