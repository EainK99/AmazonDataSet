It's a poorly-kept secret that the key to metal distortion tones is found in tweaking the midranges.  When it comes building a good metal distortion pedal, however, the Joyo Pocket Metal proves that, sometimes, less is more.  There is a crowded field of competent metal pedals out there, including the venerable Boss Metal Zone and MXR Fullbore Metal.  But while the assortment of midrange knobs on those pedals theoretically makes the \\"perfect tone\\" possible, it also leaves you constantly bumping and tweaking with knobs, which always seem \\"just a bit off\\".<br /><br />Fortunately, the Joyo Pocket Metal is a pedal that rocks as soon as you plug it in.  There is no tone control for bass/treble - this has been replaced by a single \\"Mid\\" control.  Still, you get quite a bit of versatility ranging from scooped (muffled, thumpy) mids, to boosted (punchy, clear) mids.<br /><br />The Pocket Metal has gotten considerably less hype than many of its excellent Joyo counterparts, but I think it deserves more praise.  Having been recently disappointed by the low output of the Joyo Hot Plexi, I was pleased to find that the Pocket Metal is plenty loud.  You also won't miss having an independent bass control - it has plenty of low end.  Actually, the Mid knob can do quite a bit to emphasize or de-emphasize the \\"thump\\" effect of the low end, as well.<br /><br />I also was quite happy with how the pedal responds to higher notes and lead guitar playing.  While it isn't quite as melodic as many high-gain overdrive pedals, the individual notes are well defined and can sustain quite a bit with the \\"Dist\\" knob turned up.  Also, while the pedal produces some noise, it's quieter than I expected it to be given the level of gain.<br /><br />The build quality is what is - probably better suited for home players and recording than a live setting.  But at this price point, you get no compromise in tone quality or simplicity.  I'm not a huge metal player, but this just became my go-to pedal for all things metal.ings metal.
