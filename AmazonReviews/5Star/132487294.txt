This little cart has been everything I expected it to be.  We have a flea market booth and so we have a lot of stuff we move around from time to time.  I have used this cart as a platform to move boxes, and as a dolly to move bigger stuff like chests of drawers.  It has performed very well for me in both capacities.  It isn't good for moving very heavy objects, but I didn't expect it to be.
