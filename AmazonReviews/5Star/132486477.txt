I've had this for a few months now (I finally replaced my &#34;out of the box-all in one&#34; player) and this turntable as been perfect. Its a great size and does exactly what you need it to do; play your records. The auto-play and stop features are great for anyone who doesn't have a steady hand and the dust cover keeps the turntable and needle free from dust. As for speakers, I'm using an older set from an old HP desk computer (complete with sub) and it sounds great. For someone looking for something a little more put together than say one of those briefcase type of players, or just appreciates their music a little more than the average cat, this player is great.
