OK my first review and I had to redo this review to get to my point. First...buy this amp you wont regret it. Everything said of its capabilities is true, I did like you are now doing, extensive research to buy the best amp for your needs at a reasonable price. Your quest has ended. My biggest issue or should I say concern was the reliability and yea you've read the horrors of the amp blowing fuses. This is where Peavey fell short with this amp, and this is the only problem I have with it was the design of where the fuse is. I will say yup I blew a fuse, 2 months in I pulled the jack out while the amp was on and poof. What I tell you later will confirm this was the reason for the blown fuse. I put in my own external fuse block in the back and soldered 2 wires to each side of the blown fuse on the circuit board. That's all I did...stupidly simple if you can to simple soldering with resin solder for delicate electronics. Radio Shack had all I needed including the soldering iron, I didn't own one. Forget this warranty crap every time you blow a fuse, put one in your self in the back of the unit. Plenty of places to find how to do this...I sent pics on various site showing the procedure. This amp is definitely worth this small simple upgrade that you can do yourself. Mine works flawlessly now and yes I took the jack out while on and sure enough it blew a fuse after the second attempt. Just unscrewed the fuse holder to replace..easy.<br /><br />Buy this amp it really a great amp to learned your creative capabilities on.........<br /><br />OH YEA !! can get loud and sounds AWESOME!!! Be the rock star!!!BUY IT!!!
