One of the best value guitars you'll ever see.  The tone is fantastic, the hardware is high quality, and the finish is gorgeous.  I have the Faded Cherry model, and in person, the colors are slightly darker, definitely more orange than yellow.  It's waaaaay sexier than the photos online.  The push-pull pots are awesome; you get seven tones to choose from instead of three.  And the Epi pickups sound great, as usual, though nobody would judge if you wanted to toss some 57 Classics in there.<br /><br />This is the be-all and end-all for value, clean tone, and versatility (this baby takes dirt very well, just not too much).  HIGHLY recommended for jazz, blues, classic rock, CCM, and anything else that demands some deep, dark, warm, sexy clean tones.
