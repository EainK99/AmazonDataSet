I was browing for a booster and find this here. Already owned a MI Audio Tube zone overdrive and I know that this little moster can't fail and it didn't. Awesome, the sound just explode when you press the pedal, the controls are very responsive and the construction it's sturdy. Little size so it use little space from your pedalboard. ONE THING! The pictures in the item are not accurate, I was surprise when I recieve the latest model with the two switches for TB and Buff, and the tree modes for boosts. Another hit from Michael Ibrahim!!!!!
