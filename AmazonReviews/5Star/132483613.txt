This case is a perfect combination of a soft and hard. It's soft enough that my son doesn't hurt anyone on the bus when he accidently bangs off them, but hard on the inside to protect the sax!  Also, I read a review that suggested that if you have an &#34;old&#34; sax that it may not fit. Well, my son has a used 1976 alto sax and it fits perfectly. My son's favorite part of the case is the sheet music pocket and the compartment inside the case with a door so his extra reeds are not flying all around!
