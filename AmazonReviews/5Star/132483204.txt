I go back to the mid 70's with turntable's. Without a doubt the BEST bargain I have ever purchased a far as audio gear. The sound quality is clear and clean. It comes with everything. Just hook it up and plug it in and you are ready to go. The vinyl sounds sooo much better than any CD can.Vinyl has a warmth that no CD could ever capture. Buy it then enjoy !
