I just received this xylophone and absolutely love it! This stood out for me because it reminds me of xylophones from when I was a child, versus what I've seen recently which involves a lot of plastic and they seem to be bulkier now. This one is all wood and small, so it's the perfect size for my toddler, and I am sure I will end up tossing it in my bag when we travel and need to bring along toys. I would recommend this product as a great gift for a little one. Could make a cute stocking stuffer too for the holidays because of the size.<br /><br /> I did receive this product as a promotion for my honest and unbiased review, but regardless it's a great product and I stand by my recommendation.
