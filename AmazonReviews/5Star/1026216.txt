This is an awesome ukulele for a cheap price! My dad bought it for me (this is his account) and I absolutely love it. There was some buzzing when playing it initially, and it went out of tune fairly easily, but, with time, it stopped doing that. I think with any new ukulele, those problems are probable. It is a great starter ukulele. It is very durable as well. My two year old sister has come into my room more than a few times and threw it around, but it has yet to take any damage! This is the first instrument I have ever actually learned, and I'm so glad that I used this ukulele to do it!
