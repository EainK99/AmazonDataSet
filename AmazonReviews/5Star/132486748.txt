Having watched the price of analog synthesizers soar from fairly reasonable in the 1990's to absolutely ridiculous in the last decade, it's a nice surprise to see KORG re-release their famous MS-20 synthesizer at a price that nearly anybody can save up for.<br /><br />While all of the knobs and patch possibility's may seem a bit daunting at first, with a little help of the online tutorials on youtube (Thank You Marc Doty!) and a few weeks, the user will be able to create most any sound you could want for your music. Imagine the satisfaction when somebody ask for a particular type of sound, and you can create it in a few seconds. Especially if you are working in a band or studio setting and a quick and dirty analog synth bass or lead sound may be needed; you will be able to program it fairly quickly once you learn where everything is located and what it's functionality is.<br /><br />The keyboard feels nice and springy with a nice new bed of fresh rubber pads underneath each key, it's a feeling you are not going to find on an original vintage synthesizer from the late 1970's. The large knobs provide a very solid feel, and although the smaller knobs may not feel quite as solid as the large knobs, they work perfectly well for providing you what you need to coax the sound you want out of the machine.<br /><br />In addition to the synthesizer, you receive an AC adapter with a changeable plug input for plugging into any outlet no matter where you may be in the world, and several manuals for helping you create new sounds and learn the controls. You will even receive a reprint of the original 1978 manual complete with quirky Japanese cartoon illustrations throughout.<br /><br />Although the price of the re-release in Japan is only around $400, even at $600 this is money well spent. Five years ago, finding a 2-VCO analog mono synth for under $600 was absolutely unheard of, much less a re-release of a classic machine such as this one. The original was used early on by many groups with synth-based sound such as 'The Human League', 'OMD', and 'Severed Heads'. So you will be able to get those warm and classic tones without too much difficulty. I highly recommend this instrument to both beginners and advanced players. This is money very well spent!
