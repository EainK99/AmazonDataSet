I was hesitant about buying a guitar online...It's nice to feel it, touch it etc...still would be...but there it is.  I went to the Andreasinc site... Wow, they sell everything, must be some crazy big outfit shooting out the products in every direction but the decription and price had my attention.  I thought I'd give it a test, call them, and see if I get a human and if the human was a real human or a 1-800 rental script reading human.  I left a message on a Friday afternoon...dude calls me back after hours, like 7:00 and the dude is Andreas himself...\\"wanted to get back to you before the weekend\\".  Super nice guy and I asked him about the guitars and how he operates his online store.  He says (rough quote) \\"I've played for a long time myself and sure I've got nicer guitars, but we don't sell junk, everything we sell is solid and playable\\".  And the guitar is just that and more.  Nothing but compliments on how it looks and sounds.  I have some experience playing slide guitar but no dobro experience*...but my ear has been around long enough to say it really sounds sweet.  Maybe someday I'll say I need to spend a grand or whatever to get some other sound I think I \\"need\\" or the look of some exotic, probably illegally harvested, wood etc...maybe when I take up gigging again, and maybe when the gigs pay, yeah, and maybe someday I'll have lunch with Steve Earle and we'll do a little jamming over some good coffee, and the I'll get home and find that Mile Davis \\"Live at the Blackhawk album, that went missing about 25 years ago...until then I'll be coaxing sweet licks out this guitar, and waiting to see what this guitar can't do...Hmm, wonder if that will happen before I have lunch with Steve.<br /><br />*What I learned in the process: I had confusion/overlap of terms.  The kind of full sized, regularly shaped guitar that I wanted was a \\"square neck dobro\\", this is what is seen in bluegrass and with one of the masters, Jerry Douglas.  The same guitar that I got from Andreasinc can be had with a regular, not-squared neck.  This would be what is seen in the blues style. They are both, resonator guitars, both resophonic, this refers to the shiny, round thing with the alumninum cone inside that renders the sound and punch of these instruments.  There are other slide played instruments, lapsteel and pedal steel (others i'm sure) related but they don't look like \\"regular\\" guitars.  Another thing to be aware of is neck width....this one is what I'd called standard.  Compared to some other models I've seen after getting a little more educated where the neck is a little bit wider.  Maybe it's just a style thing, maybe it accommodates single string stuff better but so far I've not had any trouble picking out single strings.
