Works GREAT. Note, it does have the 3 pin mic hook up. I thought it had a 1/4 jack, but that would be the iRig (duh to me). But this thing is a gem!  I love it. I run my WHOLE studio into recording apps through this thing! Takes a 9v batt (included) but I have not actually turned this thing on, due to it already being powered by my main pre amp. So that being said, depending on how your going to hook it up, you may not ever even use a battery. It is very nice that it has phantom power for my condenser mic. This thing rocks!!!
