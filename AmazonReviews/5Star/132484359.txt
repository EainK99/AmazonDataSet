Including the microphones and several of their excellent headsets, I own a few Sennheiser products.<br /><br />The Sennheiser EW 112P G3-G omni-directional EW system was perfection right out of the box.  The microphones are Very intuitive and easy to use, and the results were superior to anything I've used before.<br /><br />Great sound, and exceptional battery life.  I used the omni-directional EW system system for a video shoot that lasted 5 hours.  The mics are very small, fit unobtrusively on the subject's shirt lapel and was virtually invisible in the video.  The battery's life is great, they were still fully charged when the shoot was finished. There was no interference and I didn't need to switch to another channel.  Audio recording was crystal clear. In fact, this is the first time I was able to use the audio without any post production sound processing.<br /><br />Amazon's shipping was quick and the package arrived nicely packaged.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
