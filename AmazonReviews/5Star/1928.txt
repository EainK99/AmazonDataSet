I am always looking for unique items that will WOW my grandchildren when they come to visit. This Magic Ball light is fun; it fills a room or tent with light and the automatic sound activation has my Grandchildren singing their hearts out, then giggling and laughing. Priceless!<br /><br />This has been thoroughly tested and approved by all of my grandchildren over the last couple of months and never seems to lose its appeal. It would make a nice inexpensive gift for any child for their room.<br /><br />1. RoHS, CE certified<br /><br />2. This is made of heavy plastic and has a 5 inch diameter and is 5 1/8th inches tall, it has a clear dome and colored LED lights shoot from the dome in addition to a ring of LED lights around the bottom which in combination create a two dimensional light show.<br /><br />3. The bottom is made with 2 indented screw holes and an indentation for the cord so it is easy to hang on the wall or ceiling, or just plug it in and set it on a stand.<br /><br />4. There are a total of 51 LED lights in Red, Green and Blue that rotate and fill the room with lights, for its price and size this is a very nice little light with a big light show that my Grandchildren love.<br /><br />5. There is also automated sound activation that changes the light show to match the music or at my house the songs my grandchildren sing to get the lights to speed up and change. This sound activation is not as sensitive as some lights I have tried and doesn’t pick up every nuance however it is a wonderful feature and I love hearing my three year old singing. The giggling and laughing Priceless.<br /><br />6. There are two things that I would change on this, the cord is only 35 inches long and there is no on/off switch or sound activation switch. I have it plugged into a surge protector with a switch on it so it is not constantly being plugged in and unplugged.<br /><br />Received a free sample for evaluation and unbiased review.
