This was my first mod ever. I have some soldering experience. I have to admit it took me almost three hours to complete the job. I would install one component and then test it. The hardest part was the two IC sockets. It's quite challenging to de-solder it. After all was done I was a happy camper. Now the sound...every statement on this will make your CE-3 int a boutique chorus is actually true. I wasn't expecting that. The bottom end is preserved when chorus is engaged. No volume drop. No more metallic sound. It pretty much a new pedal. I highly recommend it.
