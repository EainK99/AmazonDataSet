Exactly what we needed! We gave this to our son for his 3rd birthday. He loved it! So much better than many of the kid targeted products out there. Those were too busy, had too many bells and whistles to distract him from, and were poor quality (we tried two others before settling on this one). Although this is not targeted at kids specifically (all the older kids and adults love it too), my son loves it! It is just simple enough to keep his attention, and has many features he will grow into. Much better quality than the kid products, with a great sound!
