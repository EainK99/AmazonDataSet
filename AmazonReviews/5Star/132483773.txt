If you're looking at these strings, you're probably not a professional violinist. That's fine, neither am I. I'm just a guy who likes to play the fiddle, and I don't want to spend an arm and a leg on it.<br /><br />I found these medium tension D'Addario Prelude 4/4 violin strings to be entirely decent for my purposes. I'm sure there are better strings out there, but these sound pretty good to my ear, and at the current price of less than $14 for a set (less than $3.50/string), the price is hard to beat. If you want another budget string set for a head-to-head comparison, consider the [[ASIN:B0046IPXFY Shar Overture Premium Violin String Set - 4/4 Size - Medium Gauge]] at $14.25 shipped (currently $9.99 plus $4.25 for shipping from Shar). Some people feel that the D'Addario Prelude strings have a brighter sound than the Shar Overture strings, so it's mostly a matter of personal preference -- for my part, I prefer Prelude.
