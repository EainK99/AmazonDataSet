One of the best overdrive pedals... period. And for the price, it's a great value too.  I actually avoided it for the longest time because of all the hype but once I tried it, the sound won me over immediately.  I realized it's a classic for a reason.<br /><br />The TS9DX is a classic TS9 but with an extra knob giving you 4 modes.  Honestly, the classic TS9 mode is the only one I use but for $20 extra it's nice having the flexibility.  And some people even like the higher gain modes.<br /><br />Just be aware this is an overdrive not a distortion pedal.  It flavors your sound without overdoing it.  If you're looking for a distortion, I'd recommend an OCD pedal.  Even though this isn't a distortion, it still rocks.  Pearl Jam used TS9's.<br /><br />I've tried lots of overdrives (Boss, MXR, Electro-Harmonix and Danelectro) and this is my favorite one.  That said, you never know what will sound best in your setup but you should at least try one before you decide.
