This thing is really worth the money.  It has a great tone and control and operation is easy.  I wanted this with separate circuits for voice and dobro.  However, the manufacturing date code is 2009.  I couldn't log onto the company website, but don't care.  A great amp for a great price!  You won't go wrong.
