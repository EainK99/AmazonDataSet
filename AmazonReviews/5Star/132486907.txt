I bought this bowl for a friend of mine who is Buddhist, not knowing for sure what i was going to get.  I figured the note the bowl played didnt matter too much when giving a gift so I left it to the universe to choose.  Boy am I pleased! The bowl looks just as in the picture, and generates a pure and perfect F, for the heart chakra - again, perfect!  The bag is stunning, i even considered keeping it for myself, but figured for a traveling musician this is the perfect way to transport a meditation bowl.  My friend loves it, and was very moved when I him  the bowl.  I will definitely be buying more bowls from this seller in the near future...for ME this time though!!!  The only thing is i wish they would list the note of the bowl, which would aid in future purchasing decisions.
