This guitar polishing cloth does an amazing job of cleaning and polishing.  I've neglected my eight month old guitar, and was afraid I might grind dust particles into the surface if I used a regular cotton dust cloth.  This product is advertised as \\"micro fibers\\" which \\"scoop, lift and trap dirt\\" rather than just pushing grime around on the surface of the instrument.<br /><br />I don't understand the science behind it, but it works.  No scratches.  The cloth is thirteen inches square, has rounded corners and a closely stitched trim of soft, velvet-like material.  It's thick, but fits under the guitar strings to slide over the fret board.  The entire surface of the guitar can be reached with this super-soft cloth.  Even the strings and frets are noticeably shinier after one use.<br /><br />The cloth is machine washable.
