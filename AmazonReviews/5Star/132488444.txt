I have a really light weight Gibson SG, that is very bright and upper-midrange focused, with a very taut bass response (very woody like plucking a cello or viola or something). I wanted more low end and roundness to the midrange without sacrificing the treble response, or losing string to string clarity. This pickup in the neck did it! The DP103 seems to emphasize the lower midrange, correcting (in my ear at least), the overbearing upper midrange spike this guitar had with the original Gibson 490R. It added a nice round bottom end, not loose, or boomy, still tight, but more of it. The midrange is very pleasant, round and warm, and the treble is there, plenty without being piercing or harsh. This pickup also allows me to adjust it closer to the strings for better output without loss of sustain. Very nice! They respond well to picking dynamics, and produce good harmonics. The dp103 sounds good clean or overdriven. Previously, with the 490r, I struggled to get a clean tone I was fond of. The guitar sounded somewhat \\"plinky/chirpy\\" now it has more resonance and sustain. All I can say is it sounds great. I got out my LP and went back and forth, and now, the SG doesn't let me down!<br /><br />Be sure to follow the direction for wiring closely, or it will sound crappy to be sure. I read a review on the DP223 (the bridge version of this pickup) where the author, reviewing both pickups, states that there was no bottom end, no roundness. That is definitely not my experience with the neck pickup anyway. He may have miss wired his. These are 4-conductor, and if miss wired, say, out of phase, they will be bright, thin and lack bass response. I never set my amp's bass settings higher than 4, and it had plenty of bass response.<br /><br />Considering the price of hand wound pickups, or Gibson factory pickups for that matter, these are a screaming deal! I've also tried some \\"high quality\\" import pickups that cost about 1/3 less in price than the Dimarzio's, but the tone wasn't there. Better tone equals better value.e. Better tone equals better value.
