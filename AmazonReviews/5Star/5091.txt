Excellent beginner's bayan.  I have almost the exact same model at home here in the US.  It has a very powerful bass, and a good wide range in the treble.  The sound can fill a sanctuary - that's for sure!<br /><br />Note that this is a 100-button Stradella bass, which is a little odd - there is no diminished 7th row.  However, this simplifies the instrument for someone that wants to try a bayan without spending a huge amount of money on an instrument with all the rows, switched, and WEIGHT associated with the &#34;professional&#34; versions.<br /><br />I love this instrument.  It was a perfect starter for me, and I'm sure it will be for you, too.
