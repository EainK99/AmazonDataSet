I love this pedal. I've always loved the spring reverb that my amp does but I've wanted this pedal since i first heard about it since it can make some pretty out there reverb tones. I tried for months to find a unit in a store to try out but eventually I decided to buy the pedal with out having tried it out.<br /><br />The versitility of the pedal is great, I've been able to get anything from strange rhythmic slap back delay kind of sounds, strange surf spring reverb and some ambient washed out reverb as well. Now this isn't your standard reverb pedal. It uses a great deal of stacked up reverbs to make the cascades of sounds you will hear.<br /><br />I was really struck by the amount of control the device gives you. It has 6 knobs that allow you to control all kinds of parameters.<br /><br />I copied the explanation of the controls from the EQD website<br /><br />&#34;Length: Controls the decay length of the reverb.<br /><br />Diffuse: Adjusts the spread of the reverb. Sharper with more attack counter clockwise, more ambient and washy as you turn it clockwise.<br /><br />Dampen: Clockwise for brighter tones, counter clockwise for darker tones.<br /><br />Drag: This digital reverb is made up of a bunch of short delays, this separates the delay lines creating a stuttering, pingy effect. This is the coolest control on the Afterneath, we highly advise slowly turning this while you let notes ring out for a cool warped speed effect. More delay as you turn it counter clockwise, more reverb as you turn it clockwise.<br /><br />Reflect: Controls the regeneration of the reverb, turn clockwise for more wash and echos, counterclockwise for less. This will self oscillate if turned up high.<br /><br />Mix: Blends the wet signal into the dry. Though it does not actually go full wet, it will gradually lower the clean level as you turn it clockwise and give the appearance of full wet.&#34;<br /><br />I'm really glad I bought this pedal and love using it every chance I get. If your in the mood for an out there reverb pedal than this is the one for you!
