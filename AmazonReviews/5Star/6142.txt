I bought this pedal for my Keyboard so I could play the pedal part of the songs.  I was learning to play the piano and this pedal helped me learn to play better. It was easy to set up.  Would recommend this pedal to anyone that is learning the piano and wants to get a keyboard because it is cheaper, just remember the pedal.
