I have used every guitar string known to man and I can say these are the best on my guitar!!Have beed playing for 40 plus years and the strings have a nice bright edge to them plus they last a long time!!I tune these down to D and they are still tight yet they bend well for the blues!!!My guitar style is I can play anything,finger style,flat pick, hybrid,crosspick and these strings hold up to any type of playing..Pearse uses bell bronze and these strings are much brighter then his 80/20!!!All other srrings the opposite is true!!<br />If you want a slightly warmer tone then use his 80/20!!Oh I tune down because It's hard to hit those high notes!!  I play a couple of hand made Somogyi guitars and he sends his guitars out with John Pearse strings only!!!  I also use his light and med and they sound just great!! I use light and med on my 12 string both tuned to pitch and pearse gives the guitar that nice high harpsacordal<br />high pitched sound, kinda like McGuinns 12 string rick but better!!!!Pearse strings are the best and never had a failure!!!
