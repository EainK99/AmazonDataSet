I'm no expert, but these are nice headphone.  I've had tons of headphones over the years and these are a standout product for me so far.  Very sturdy and very loud.  The bass is also quite good for the price.  Some might say they have too much base, but for me they are perfect.  I like the cord as well.  They are somewhat noise canceling given they are closed headphones. Overall, I really can't complain at all.
