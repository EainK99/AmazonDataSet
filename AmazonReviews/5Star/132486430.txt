I am a Dj with two powered 6 1/2 inch Roland Cube monitor speakers.  These speakers rock for about 60% of the rooms I play in, plus they are small and portable.<br /><br />The bass is extremely good on the Rolands, believe it or not, but not good enough for the larger rooms.  More air needs to be moved to hit these people in the chest!  Believe me, you only need one if you are a DJ, Unless you do alot of performing outside.<br /><br />I run from the two xlr, or 1/4, outputs on my mixer to the xlr/1/4\\" inputs on the Aftershock, and use the non powered outputs on the Aftershock to my powered speakers.  I turn the bass down a to 25% on the Rolands and let the Aftershock do all the bass work.  No crossover is needed.  The SA Aftershock BASS does all filtering for you.  I haven't tried using the satelite outputs yet.<br /><br />Nobody can believe the sound you get from this setup!  I put casters on the Aftershock and roll, almost my entire setup on it.<br /><br />I think it needs some directions for different kinds of setups you can do with it.  The options are to many for me to figure out without trial and error
