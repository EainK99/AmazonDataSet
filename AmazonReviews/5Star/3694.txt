The Best budget Audio amplifier and most feature rich device. It is not only a Amplifier but also a USB External Sound card as well as a Hands-Free device and also a sound multiplier as you can connect two audio devices with it. It has impressive range and can handle headphone upto 600 Ohm impedance. It dramatically improves the quality of my Audio Technica ATH-M50X, when using with Android Phones or IPOD Classic which can't provide the output performance of the headphone.<br />When connected to your Computer via USB, it works as a external sound card. You can download the Creative Sound Blaster E series Control panel software (both Mac and Windows) to configure the output as per your test. It is far better than any integrated budget laptop sound cards. But with any other OS like Android or iOS, it is just an amplifier.
