I originally purchased these because of all the positive feedback and comparisons I had seen in the comments, and because I was in a dire need for high quality headphones that would last.    However, I got kind of worried after reading all the other comments on how they're not really for bass (like beats), or audiophiles in general--so when I received them I had the bias that I'd probably be sending them back.    After curing them over a couple of days I realized that would not be the case.  Typically I love to be overwhelmed by bass. But the fact that these aren't so bass heavy is what makes them golden...but don't get me wrong, the subs in these are fantastic.    Everything is so equally balanced as it should be, that I feel like the intricacies of all the different parts in a song (that normally are overlooked) can really stand out. I also don't have to turn up the volume super high to get the effect I want from music. So the fact that these don't hurt my ears is a huge plus. Oh, they also can be worn comfortably for long periods of time.    Get these if you enjoy music the way it was meant to be, enjoy subtleties, want headphones that are comfortable.  The only problem is that I only want to listen to music through these. Its painful to find music while wearing these, and then when you try to show a friend through their s**** laptop speakers, it doesn't come out the same..and you're like \\"I promise this music is delicious!\\"    Oh and also the music I mainly listen to are varying subgrenres of electronic music: such as trap (the good kind that's found in the deepest depths of youtube), moombah, dubstep, chill wave, noise, future garage etc.  These headphones work vary well for all of those genres.
