I have a 41&#34; Martin that has a nice hard case. I bought this for a 38&#34; inexpensive guitar to take to guitar lessons. Both acoustic. First I tried the 38&#34; guitar in the bag and it had plenty of room. The real test was trying the 38&#34; in the bag (not that I'll use it with this guitar) - it fit just fine too - perfect actually, not too tight, just exactly right. It's a nice canvas bag and I'm very pleased for the price. Thank you!
