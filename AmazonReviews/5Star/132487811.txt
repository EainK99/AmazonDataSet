I used to lug my mandolin around to gigs and festivals in its hard case, but no more. This bag is sttractive and has plenty of storage. I've stuffed the three pockets on the front with spare strings, a patch cable, metronome, tuner, pencils, picks -- there is room for everything and it stays well organized. The backpack straps free up my hands to carry my music stand and music books, and the water bottle pouch is a nice touch. The padding is sufficient for most purposes -- I switch back to the hard case when I fly with it but otherwise my mando lives in this bag!
