As a semi-professional musician, I have experimented with so many different bass strings and now I have finally found my match.  DR Dragon skins provide all that I need from my strings ... just my ideal combination of deep lows, punchy mids, and bright, without harshness, highs.  They feel soft and fast under my fingers.  I am now DR Dragon Skins' biggest fan and  since Amazon is offering the lowest price I have  found on the web, I'll be stocking up.
