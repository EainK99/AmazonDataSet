I absolutely love the color of this instrument. Even more beautiful than the picture. The sound is wonderful. I have never owned a uke before this one, but I expected less depth. This gives off warm notes that convey feeling. Very happy and impressed! It stays tuned better each time I use it. Even the box it arrived in was cute. Happy I bought this model!
