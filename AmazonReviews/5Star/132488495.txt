As the instructions indicate, it is a good thing to check to see whether the battery is properly seated before proceeding with installation and use. Having done that, I applied this little gem both to my cajon and bongos, plugged into a mixer and, viola!, great sound. It's also very easy to switch from one instrument to another via the suction cup. No problem! This pickup is well worth the money.<br />Chuck
