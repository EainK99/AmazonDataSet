I definitely recommend this drum pad for any fellow marching percussionists. This pad is extremely durable and it plays just like an actual marching snare drum. It goes easy on the sticks and is very good. It fits perfectly on a snare drum for marching. If this is your first pad I believe you won't need a replacement for some time because it is very easy to clean, just put it under water. I recommend this pad for every marching percussionist out there.
