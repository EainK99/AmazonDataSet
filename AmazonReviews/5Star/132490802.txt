I am mostly a folk musician, practice at home, and do a few gigs around town. Standing up is fine for a song or two, but longer than that it is nice to have a comfortable place to sit. It is also great to have a comfortable chair to practice in/on.<br />This &#34;throne&#34; really fits the bill.<br />I am a mechanical moron and am usually intimidated by the message &#34;needs some assembly.&#34; Not a problem; simple instructions and everything fit together easily, very little sweat on my part. Nicely adjustable for height, and the footrest is superb (barstools are a nice substitute, but they never seem to get the footrest part right for me). Easily portable too.<br />Only one complaint. I wish the back were more adjustable. There is only one position, and I would have preferred to be abl to move it back some. Other than that, though, I am very satisfied.
