I use this to record a small group Bible study in a room. It picks up the audio from everyone very well, sometimes too much as it can pick up background noise and I have to filter the recording with GarageBand. I use it in conjunction with the Shure X2U XLR to USB adapter plugged into a MacBook Pro Retina 15&#34;.
