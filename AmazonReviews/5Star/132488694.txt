i seldom write reviews (although i should, as i use the crowd's wisdom often, so i should contribute to it a bit), so the product has to be really great and useful for me to jump into this.<br />and this simple stand makes the cut.<br />it holds my ipad 3 in any position, and has already provoked the envy of several of my friends, who are ordering them right away.<br />i'll be using it at an art gallery and show, but there are a million uses: holding up a restaurant's menu at the entrance, slideshowing a real estate presentation, etc...<br />and all for a very solid and sturdy product at a very reasonable price. you only understand what goes into construction of something as 'simple' as this, when you start putting it in every imaginable position.<br />good job, pyle!
