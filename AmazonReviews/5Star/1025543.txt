If you're wondering YES THIS WORKS THE BLUE YETI FLAWLESSLY. With no modification this works out of box with the blue yeti. The yeti adapter is inside the normal mic holder, unscrew it, screw it into the yeti, and boom. I did have to modify the mount because my desk is NOT flat. That is NOT a fault of the product, but if your desk isn't flat and squared off no mount will really work. I'm using a modified mount to extend the grip length, but still using this boom, for $12 its AMAZING. $12 and some elbow grease got me a $99 mount. Even with a $99 mount I would have had to modify the clamp on point as my desk is not suitable for these things. The stand doesn't sag any even with the heavy yeti, and with my set-up now I am 100% hands free with no microphone blocking. When it's out of use I can just fold it up and be done with it.<br /><br />The ONLY issue I've noticed is if you want the Yeti to sit sideways its a BIT heavy so it sags a tiny bit, but it is do-able sideways. Overall the build quality is very nice, much nicer than I expected for the price. I'm loving it.
