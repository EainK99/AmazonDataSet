This is a fantastic guitar for anyone who is concerned about comfort and playability.  The neck plays incredibly smooth and pitch bends feel effortless anywhere on the neck.  The body is also very comfortable when playing sitting or standing.  I never feel like there is anything getting in the way of my right arm.  Great guitar for shredding.<br />  The tone of this guitar is amazing too.  It sounds very thick and full but very tight at the same time.  Also very bright but without sounding tinny or too treble heavy.  Sounds very good both clean and distorted and the combination of five-way pickup switch for the humbuckers, piezo pickup, and toggle switch that let's you combine the piezo and the humbuckers gives this guitar a very good variety of tones.  And piezo pickup sounds almost exactly like an actually acoustic guitar.  So i highly recommend this guitar to any professional guitarist looking for a guitar that's versatile and very easy to play.
