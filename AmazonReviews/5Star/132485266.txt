I needed this stand to hold an instruction manual for courses I teach.  It is perfect.  Lightweight, easy to carry with a perfect carrying case.  I actually took it on a trip last week as a carryon bag.  The stand is just sturdy enough to hold one heavy manual.  I wouldn't suggest anything heavier.  It was super easy to assemble, no tools required.<br />I highly recommend it.
