I switched to these reeds after becoming dissatisfied with Vandoren V12s.  With the Vandorens I found that only a couple of the reeds per box were workable.  Most of the Gonzalez FOF reeds were extremely playable from the start and produce a nice rich sound. I have been playing on the Gonzalez FOF reeds for the last ten years and have been extremely happy with them.
