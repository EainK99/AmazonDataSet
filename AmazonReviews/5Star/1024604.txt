I am a beginning player and not a violin expert but I know quality when I see it. This violin comes with everything that you need to begin playing immediately. The violin is already strung with quality strings and the bridge is in place. The chromatic tuner does an adequate job once you get the hang of using it. The chin rest isn't the highest quality that I've used, however, it's included and works fine. My only complaint revolves around the rosin. The included rosin was very, very hard to get started and I ended up replacing it with a $4.99 version at Guitar Center which worked immediately and helped produce a beautiful sound. The case is fairly sturdy and has room for both bows, (2 cakes of) rosin, the extra bridge, and the tuner with some space left over. The instruction book and DVD is helpful and I feel that I'll use it more as time progresses. The violin itself is gorgeous and well made; producing a clear, sweet tone when played. I highly recommend this purchase for a beginning or even intermediate player. The only 'extras' I purchased were a practice mute and fretless finger guide which I do recommend.
