I didnt even know that $20 earbuds were a thing. I always thought that they were like $50-100, but I guess not. I have been using this particular set of earbuds for 2 weeks now and I am liking it so far. The sound quality is great, as the bass, mids and highs are all balanced. The cables are well built, and they dont feel like they are going to break when you yank it out of your phone. The noise isolation works to an extent, but for the most part it is really good. Overall, these earbuds are amazing for $20.
