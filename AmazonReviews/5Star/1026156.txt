The included music program is very light, but it has a neat feature to listen via microphone/computer, and find the frequency of the note you're playing, and tell you whether it's the correct note or not.<br /><br />The power supply, and headphones are fine. Headphones are not high quality, but comfortable and fine for a MIDI keyboard.  The low octave range on the keyboard is limiting, but this is great for learning treble and bass clef, and how to play before investing in a higher quality keyboard.
