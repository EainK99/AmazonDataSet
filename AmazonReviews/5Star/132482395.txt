My sister and I wanted to learn how to play an instrument. We didn't have any time to be too serious about learning it, so violin and piano are out of the choices. Guitar is too much big for my sister and I'm not a guitar fan (because of the chords, I have small hands T.T) so this was a great decision in our part.<br /><br />It's very easy to learn as much as it is challenging. It creates beautiful music too! So for all beginners, this is a must learn/buy instrument! (Did we mention that includes very quality string? Well it is. It's awesome.)
