So far it seems great! I got it as a temp stand to maybe hold for a couple days. Pretty much while I record by the computer, or just play in my favorite guitar chair. I will say I was a little worried about how it would be on a nitro finish. I have a 2007 Thin Skin Fender Jaguar and didn't want anything happening to the amazing blue finish. So I opted for the route of extreme caution. I had an old black t-shirt laying around that didn't fit anymore and very strategically cut it up and created pads on three parts. The first was at the top where the guitar makes contact with the stand. The little piece there unscrews and I hot glued a custom cut piece of shirt there. The second part is where the guitar makes contact with the bottom foam part. There I created little roll ups of t-shirt where the guitar makes contact with the bottom foam part of the stand. I have read horror stories of these, or any stands for that matter reeking havoc on thin skin beauties. For $12.50 you really can't complain though, and with the t-shirt upgrades this thing is just what I needed. I am not sure the effects (maybe none) of leaving a guitar with an unsupported neck are. Which is why I stated that this will be a couple day stand at most, other than that I make sure she hangs on the wall. :) Oh and the project took about 15 min at most.
