An extremely satisfying pedal at a great price.<br /><br />I use it with a Strat through a 15w Fender Super Champ XD tube amp and get very good results on many settings of the pedal; so it's not one of those pedals with just one or two sweet spots. Sweet spots are plentiful with the East River Drive.<br /><br />I've tried lots of overdrive pedals, and this one is definitely a winner. For example, I have a Maxon OD808 and tested the East River Drive against it. They deliver similar, but not identical, results--if you like the Maxon, you'll like this pedal. Sometimes I find myself preferring the ERD. That's hard to admit since the Maxon cost me about $150.<br /><br />Note that this pedal will not, by itself, give you high-gain or metal distortion, though it can be used to boost an already overdriven amp into distortion mayhem.<br /><br />I get even better results with this pedal when I put an Electro-Harmonix LPB-1 (Linear Power Booster--a clean boost) in front of it in the pedal chain and set the LPB-1 for a modest volume increase. I cannot shower enough praise on the LPB-1. It currently sells for about $40 and improves your sound when combined with any other pedal (especially overdrive/distortion pedals) or on its own. However, you do NOT need a clean boost (or any boost) to get great sounds out of the ERD, but a boost helps when you're using single-coil pickups.<br /><br />Aesthetically, the Green River Drive is ultra cool. Its image of NYC is suprisingly detailed and stylish for such an inexpensive pedal. The green and black combination is a hit. (Don't even pretend a pedal's looks don't matter!)<br /><br />It comes with an installed 9v battery but not with an adaptor. But it accepts typical 9v adaptors.<br /><br />The box is all-metal, so tough that it can be used as a weapon!<br /><br />If I lost this pedal, I would buy another right away with no hesitation at all.but not with an adaptor.<br /><br />The box is all-metal, so tough that it can be used as a weapon!<br /><br />If I lost this pedal, I would buy another right away with no hesitation at all.
