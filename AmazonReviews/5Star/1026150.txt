This microphone is perfect! It is exactly what I've been looking for. The sound quality is stellar and a huge improvement from my last microphone-which had wonderful sound quality, but just can't compare to this bad boy. So far I have made over 100 recordings on the Yeti, and each has come out great. I like that you can adjust the gain so I can sit farther away from the microphone if I want, or if my dogs are making noise in the background I can get up close without worrying about picking up their weird noises. I generally keep it on one of the pattern settings, but I like that I can change settings if I want to try something new, like conduct an interview.
