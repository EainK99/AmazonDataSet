This light is great. I purchased it to use at night when I read before I go to bed, and to clip onto my laptop when I am working in dim-lit places to light up the keyboard. It works perfectly for those uses. It clips to my headboard and the light it gives off to read at night is great. Now I don't have to get up and turn off my lights before I go to sleep! It also comes with a charger and carrying case which is a great plus. The lights are really bright but not blinding, therefore offering any type of lighting you may need. I highly recommend this product.
