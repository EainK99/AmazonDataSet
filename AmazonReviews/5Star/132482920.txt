I toyed around with the different options and I think I came to the same conclusion that most other people have, that there is no reason to waste a lot of money on LED lighting. These very exactly what they need to do, are very cool to the touch, energy-efficient, and can adapt to almost any situation. I just finished buying these once again. The only thing that I would change is as some other people have described, they are not as &#34;soft white&#34; as advertised.
