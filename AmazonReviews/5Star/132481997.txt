If you want true Marshall sound then this amp is for you. I ordered this amp because I wanted something portable with great tone and I got it sooner than expected. If you think 40 watts is not enough, let me tell you, this thing kicks butt! I use my Boss GT10 with the 4 cable system into the EFX send and return. The cleans are sparkling and the distortions are incredible. It has more power and gain than anyone would ever need. Check out the vids on youtube for more info. I wish I had one like this years ago.
