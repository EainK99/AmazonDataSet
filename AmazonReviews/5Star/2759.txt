When I started playing back in elementary school, I used Rico reeds.  Played a progression of quality through junior high, high school (jazz, concert, marching), then into college playing with a band.<br /><br />Fell out of playing. Had a resurgence a few years back, got to using Vandoren.  D'Addario wasn't a familiar name to me.<br /><br />Turns out, in my ignorance, D'Addario has been a long time player in the reed industry, and purchased Rico a little while back.  These are the newest expression of Rico Reserve.<br /><br />Quality is strong. Consistent.  Each one plays well.  Provides good experience, tone, and sound.<br /><br />I definitely recommend trying these out.
