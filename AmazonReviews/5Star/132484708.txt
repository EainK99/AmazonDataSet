This ocarina is so gorgeous and it sounds wonderful. I myself have had two of them in the past (although they're both broken now) and they were incredibly easy to learn and to play. The artistry on these ocarinas are so creative and beautifly painted that I can't help but love them. I would definitely reccommend them.
