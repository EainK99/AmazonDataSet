im an intermediate level bluegrasser. When I bought a nice old fiddle, i purchased 8 pairs of strings and spent a whole day putting strings on, listening and comparing. This was the winner, and so its the only type of strings for my fiddle. Highly recommended for bluegrass. They last 6 months with a lot of playing, a year if not played much.
