We purchased this for our daughter for her 10th birthday...she loves to sing, and is pretty good, too, so we wanted to encourage her in that gift! :)  It is a HIT!!  It's very easy to use - one thing I like is that you can use NORMAL CDs with it - not just the CD+G - which was something that was important to us.  So far, it has had very good sound - clear, not muffled.  We also like that you can hook up two microphones - since she has a little sister, we decided it might be a good idea to get an extra mic. ;)  We like that you can control the volume of the mic, but wish there were two separate volume controls - one for each mic.  Other than that....it's been a wonderful purchase, and we are very happy!  It has gotten a LOT of use...as a parent, can I say sometimes maybe a little too much? ;) haha
