I love this amp! I started playing electric guitar in 1987, then started electric bass in 1989. I've always been a Peavey fan, but there was something about this amp that initially had more appeal (not really sure what it was). I was skeptical, but the price was right, and at the time a free foot pedal came as part of the promotion. Okay, sold! I gave it a try. I initially had some of the issues I've heard others complain about (about the sound being kind of flat), but then started figuring out how to dial in what I really wanted. There are some of the user presets that I hate, some of which actually sound like they might damage the amp, but it's easy enough to replace or change them (of course you can reset factory presets very easy). The bottom line is this amp is very flexible and can accommodate an incredibly wide genre of music. If you have the FBV Express MkII footswitch you can connect to the internet for program updates (via your computer and a USB cable). With the footswitch, you can also use your computer to add additional options in customizing your sounds. I've enjoyed this amp and recommend it highly.
