This is the only electronic metronome I could find with my must-have features:<br />- good volume control<br />- can be powered with a wall plug (using a 9v power supply not included with the metronome)<br />- stands up sturdily on its own<br /><br />The construction is fine, solidly-put-together plastic. The click/ding sounds are fine -- electronic-sounding wood block and bell sounds. The volume control is the real deal, from silent (just lights) to quite loud. The lights across the top mimic the swing of a metronome surprisingly effectively. The dial for speed control is great, easy to turn. I'd avoid dropping this on the floor, though; if it hits dial-first, I'd expect damage to the dial.<br /><br />This isn't the smallest electronic metronome, at about 1&#34; x 5 3/8&#34; x 2 1/4&#34;, but it's small enough to fit in the accessory pouch inside my cello case. The tall/narrow format doesn't take a lot of space on top of the piano, which is nice.<br /><br />After using it about 1/2 hour/day for a month, it's going strong on the original battery.<br /><br />I can't think of a thing I'd change.
