I've relegated my receiver and CD-player to the closet, and use my computer for all my sound/music needs.  I use the TCC TC-716 6-Way Stereo Source Selector to manage my various inputs and outputs: my speakers, headphones, guitar amp, and computer sound.  It's a great gadget, but it also attenuates the volume, and my computer's on-board sound doesn't have any to spare.  The speakers, being powered, aren't bothered by the slight drop, but I needed something to boost the sound for headphone listening.  This did the job.<br /><br />I only need one of the channels, so it's overkill for my use, but it seemed like a good product with good reviews and it wasn't any more expensive than  decent-quality single-channel amps.  If anything, it's cheaper.  I've tested all 4 channels and they work.  I don't experience any hum or interference from using it, nor do I experience any static or any other issues when listening to my headphones, or when adjusting the volume knob.  It's velcro'ed in place, and neither it nor the cables move, so I can't talk about if that would cause crackling/static, or if they would come loose.  A cursory wiggle of the box and wires did not disturb the sound quality.<br /><br />It does what I needed without any problems.  I've only had it two months and a few days, but so far, so good.
