I was looking for an amplifier that was battery powered, but had different sounds.  The NanoVypyr didn't dissapoint.  This amplifier has a ton of different models and the battery life is way long.  We also plugged a microphone in the 1/4\\" input to do announcing.<br /><br />This amp rocks!<br /><br />Thanks,
