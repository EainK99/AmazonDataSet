I had read some reviews about this cover and many people were frustrated that it didn't fit their amp.  All I can say is that they must have ordered the wrong one for their amp because it fits great on mine.  In fact, I installed an additional handle on the side of my amp so that it was easier to lift with two hands, and the cover even slips over the additional handle with no problem.  I also like the velcro strap that runs under the amp to hold the cover in place.
