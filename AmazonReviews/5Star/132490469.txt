This banjo was my gift to my three year old grandson who is obsessed with musical instruments.... It was the highlight of his<br />birthday.... He played it all morning and had to be encouraged to open his other presents....<br /><br />quality and tone were very good........ we are very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />Lori Mandy
