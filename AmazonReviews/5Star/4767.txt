I bought these headphones as a starter pair for the home studio I am currently building.The response range is not the best on the market but excellent for the price range.The sound quality is exceptional as well.I have been using there for quite a while now and can say they are durable, as they have been knocked of stands, and dropped quite a few times.I like the sound of them, and have not heard any crackling, or popping even though they have been subjected to loud signals a lot.I would recommend these if you want a good started set.
