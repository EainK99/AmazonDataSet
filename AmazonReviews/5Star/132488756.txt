I've played on a Vincent Bach 1-1/2C since I was a freshman in high school.  I bought an Olds Ambassador trumpet on e-bay for my son that didn't come with a mouthpiece.  I bought this Bach 3C mouthpiece to go along with it, since I have been impressed with the quality of the Bach mouthpieces.  Now, being that I'm not a true professional, I can't attest to which company produces the best mouthpieces.  I have, however, been playing the trumpet/cornet since 1986 and CAN say that Bach produces a fine one, especially for elementary school and high school kids.  I recommend the 3C for use in both marching band and concert band.  It produces a warmer tone than the 7C or the 5C, but doesn't cause chops to fatigue like the 1-1/2C can during longer performances.  I would recommend this without reservation.
