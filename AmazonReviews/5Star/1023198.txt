I'm a guitarist and this is my first Uke. The instrument arrived well packaged and in perfect condition. The included gig bag and pitch pipes were good quality and a nice touch. The Honu's build quality is really good. The action and intonation is perfect. The quality of the Nygut strings make a big difference and the tone of the instrument and the projected volume is exceptional. I did a fair bit of research before buying this Uke and I normally don't buy musical instruments without playing them, but there is no issue with the Honu, its great and feels like a much more expensive instrument.
