Bought this gig bag to go along with a new bass. Compared to locally available offerings, this one beats out quality on almost all and has the best price by far.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  Very good build quality. Seams are all solid, zippers and straps are all sturdy and smooth to use and adjust.<br />  Carrying handle is perfectly balanced, and shoulder straps have a wide range of adjustable lengths and are comfortable enough to wear for a while. Padding would be nice,  but not necessary.<br />  Long enough for virtually any production model bass. Fits my 34-scale with about 6-8 inches of extra space, and plenty of extra width throughout.<br />  About an inch of padding on either side, and a lovely red satin rip-stop interior ensures ample protection from dust, scratches, and minor knocks and bumps. If you want more security than this, you'll probably just want to get a hard case.<br />  Two huge pockets and one smaller one, the smallest one easily big enough for a boxed set of strings. I'd prefer a smaller pocket or two for organizational reasons, but no complaints.<br />  A very high level of polish all around, there is not one thing 'cheap' anywhere on this item.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  Smaller pockets would be nice, hardly a complaint at this price.<br /><br />No other issues; great bag, great price, great delivery, definitely recommended. I'll add this company to the list for any future gear I need as well, if it's the same quality and price I would be very pleased.
