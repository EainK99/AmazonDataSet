After using these headphone cables for about two months, I ordered another pair as back up since I seem to be able to snag headphone cables on everything. To date I still have the other pair in reserve even though I have snagged them, stepped on them and just generally used them. These cables stand up to everyday use. I use Shure 535 headphones with both an iPod and iPhone 5 and the cables work flawlessly.
