I am a member of the Dallas Ukulele Headquarters which is the second largest ukulele group in the States and have several ukuleles. I added the Blueridge tenor guitar to my rotation for volume and a broader sound. I have replaced the top three strings with Worth baritone ukulele strings and tuned the tenor DGBE. I left the 1st string steel as if gives a great ring and resonance. The Blueridge BR-60T has great sustain and volume. The finish is well done and the setup is great for the type of playing I do. I love the narrow neck which suits my short fingers and makes playing barre chords much easier.
