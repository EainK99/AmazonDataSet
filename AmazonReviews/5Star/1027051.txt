I received these and just as in the 'un-boxing ' video for the white version they are pretty plain and nondescript BUT boy... are they bright.<br /><br />They will work PERFECTLY for the the project i have them intended for however, one was damaged as the connection is a bit on the weak side so beware, handle them gently. Especially where the wire comes out of the fixture and goes into the shrink tubing. Mine was broken/disconnected right out of the package but I still gave a five-star rating as customer service was excellent. They emailed back the same day and shipped out a replacement immediately.<br /><br />I may end up purchasing another two pairs, at least.
