And now what can I do? I mean these 10 picks arrived as you can see in the photo that's with a Jon Bon Jovi playing his guitar photo and 10 picks (one of the is also signed) which are hanging on the photo. This makes the item really wounderfull so I don't know if to leave everything like it is or take down the picks by the photo and put them in a little light candelholden as I've made with others picks I bought. But it looks so wounderful that this time I'll leave all the picks at their own place and I'll put the photo with its picks in my &#34;music corner&#34;.<br />I like so much this item that I'd give it not only 5 stars, other 6 stars as the strings of Jon Bon Jovi guitar and other 10 stars as the picks wihch are hanging to the photo.<br />Believe me, don't miss this item!!!
