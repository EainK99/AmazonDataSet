We got one to try as we really weren't sure if this would be a good solution for our daily broadcast studio. We're happy to report, this mic is VERY good! Clean crisp vocals right off our flat eq board and after a bit of tweaking, sounds as good as the PR40 or the Procaster. The price is phenomenal as well so we're ordering 4 more.<br /><br />As there is only one very sad video on YouTube about this mic from 3 years ago, we're going to do a proper one very shortly talking more about specifics.<br /><br />You need a good quality broadcast mic for vocals? Get this!
