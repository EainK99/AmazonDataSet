I am very pleased so far with these cables. I was searching all over for a 20/25 ft. woven and shielded guitar cable before I decided on this one. After looking into it, I ended up buying two and I am very pleased with my choice. They are as described and shipped on time. I don't foresee any problems with these. They're good cables and I would recommend them!
