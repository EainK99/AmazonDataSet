I purchased this guitar for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  The slim neck is easy for her to play with her small hands.  She can use it with or without an amp. It's really beautiful and the sound is mellow. I purchased it on eBay because they had the only lefty that I could find. I recommend this and would purchase this brand again.
