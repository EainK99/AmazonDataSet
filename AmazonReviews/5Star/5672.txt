Ok if your a perfectionist as far as finish is concerned spend more money and buy a higher end unit.The finish on mine looks fine from 1 foot away. However if you get a magnifying glass out and get seriously close into detail the finish is not gonna be equal to what you find on high end units. BUT IF YOU WANT SOME CHEAP PICKUPS THAT ROCK,HERE THEY ARE!!!These things Scream! And you can , and probably will argue with me til doomsday. But I think they sound every bit as good as ANY Seymour Duncan I have ever heard or non active EMG for that matter. These things will definitely leave your jaw dropped open when you get them installed and start playing.
