THE MELODY MAKER IS A MORE AFFORDABLE GIBSON BUT IT RETAINS THAT AMERICAN MADE QUALITY.  IT MAY NOT HAVE ALL OF THE BELLS AND WHISTLES OF MORE EXPENSIVE GIBSON MODLES BUT IT PLAYS GREAT, LOOKS GREAT AND IT IS A TRUE GIBSON GUITAR LEGEND IN ITS OWN RIGHT.  THESE GUITARS ARE PLAYED BY THE PROS AND STUDENTS ALIKE.  THE MELODY MAKER GUITAR IS NOT AS HEAVY AS SOME OF ITS BIGGER VERSIONS BUT THAT CAN BE A RELIEF TO YOUR BACK IF YOU ARE HAVING TO PLAY ON STAGE STANDING UP FOR HOURS PLAYING AT A GIG.  THE GUITAR IS VERY BASIC WITH ONE PICK UP AND A VOLUME CONTROL WHICH IS ALL YOU NEED TO PLAY ROCK OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF MUSIC.  I HAVE USED THIS GUITAR TO PLAY GIGS AND FOR RECORDING SESSIONS IN THE STUDIO.  THIS IS A WELL MADE USA ROCK AND ROLL MACHINE.  IF YOU CAN AFFORD SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A HIGH END GIBSON YOU MOST LIKELY WOULD NOT BE ANY BETTER SERVED THAN IF YOU HAD SAVED ALOT OF MONEY AND GOT A MELODY MAKER INSTEAD.  I LOVE THE MELODY MAKER AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANYTHING MADE BY GIBSON USA.  WHEN IT IS ALL SAID AND DONE WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE AND A PROPER AMP YOU CAN MAKE THE MELODY MAKER SOUND JUST AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER GUITAR AT ANY PRICE.  YOU JUST CAN NOT BEAT THAT GIBSON SOUND.
