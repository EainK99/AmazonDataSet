I love this cornet! It has the sweetest sound. It is a magnificent instrument and Tristarr customer support is excellent! One of Tristarr's representatives, Rachel, was an outstanding help in resolving a minor problem.   This instrument is so sweet-sounding yet so powerful. I would recommend that any trumpet or cornet player try one. It may be at the quality level of professional instruments which cost several thousands of dollars.  I am so very pleased with this cornet!
