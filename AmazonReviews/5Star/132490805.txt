This is a very nice addition to my Harmonica collection. Although made in China, it's tone<br />and tremolo is outstanding. It requires a little practice to master the double reed mouthpiece,<br />but it's worth the effort. Hohner harmonicas are normally expensive, so this &#34;Echo&#34; harp<br />is an excellent deal!
