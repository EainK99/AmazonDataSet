This cord worked exactly like I expected to.  Works perfectly, it is sleek, it is great for my living room for connecting phones or laptops to my speakers.  What really surprised me was the fast shipping, given that shipping was free.  Before I even started tracking the package it was in my mailbox.  Will be back  for more if needed.
