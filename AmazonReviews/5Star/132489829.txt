i love this case, Perfect size to fit a standard rack mount mixer with room to spare for a lighting controller or power strip. The angled rails allow for a surprisingly roomy compartment underneath the mixer that is great for stashing short cables and accessories. Build quality is solid and the black hardware makes this case look super classy and sleek, a positive when working at events like weddings where style is and important factor.
