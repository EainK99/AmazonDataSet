I have been using this microphone for 3 months now. I have to say I love it! Simple to set up, no issues with feedback or anything. The stand is sufficient depending on your needs. It isn't flimsy. I did recently put it on a scissor arm mic stand  as that better fits my needs but the stand worked well until then and I am keeping in for the future. With normal editing(background noise removal) with any mic I have recordings that are the same as those with pricier mics!
