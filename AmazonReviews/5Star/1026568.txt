Jim Dunlop products seem to work fine with my instruments so far. Used it on stock Fender Strings on a couple of my guitars to see how this product works. Cannot really tell a huge difference but the strings did feel cleaner and it did remove some dirt and dust. Well see but not a bad product as far as I can see. Maybe &#34;test&#34; a guitar or two and compare for yourself. With so many different strings on the market it may work better for some and not so much on others...that's why I'm trying different instruments. Good luck.
