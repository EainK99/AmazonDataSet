I've owned the black version of the Classic Player Jazzmaster Special for a little over a year now and I'm still quite happy with it.  I also have an American Vintage 62 Reissue (AVRI) Jazzmaster which I've owned for several years.  This review is intended for those who are curious about the differences between the AVRI Jazzmasters and the Mexican-made Classic Player (CP) version.<br /><br />The thing that surprised me the most about CP Jazzmaster were the pickups -- they were much hotter than I anticipated.  I've tried Seymour Duncan \\"Quarter-Pound\\" Jazzmaster pickups in the past, and I believe these Classic Player pickups are even hotter than the Duncans.  As a result, the CP has a raw, rock'n'roll sound, even if it doesn't quite sound like a vintage Jazzmaster.  With enough overdrive, it sounds almost like a Gibson guitar.<br /><br />The CP also addresses some of the common annoyances with traditional Jazzmasters.  The CP Jazzmaster has a Tune-o-matic style bridge rather than the weird bridges on traditional Jazzmasters that people often replace.  The Tune-o-matic style bridge makes it easier to adjust the height and intonation, and it's a little bit harder to knock the strings out of saddles.  The tail piece is also moved closer to the bridge, which improves the break angle and reduces the \\"buzz\\" that many people complain about with traditional jazzmasters.  I've also noticed that the closer tail piece allows for a more dynamic vibrato on the CP Jazzmaster.  One subtle difference between the vibrato arm of the CP Jazzmaster is that it is a screw-on arm while the AVRI's have pop-in arms.  I actually prefer the screw-on arm because it allows you to control how loose or tight you want the vibrato arm to be.  Although I haven't had a problem with my AVRI vibrato arm, I've heard that the pop-in arms can get floppy over time.  I HATE floppy vibrato arms.  Screw-in arms can also get loose over time, but that can be very easily fixed with some plumbing tape.<br /><br />The CP Jazzmaster also has a flatter fretboard radius and larger frets than the AVRI version which allows you to set the action lower without \\"fretting out\\".  Both the CP and AVRI have substantial C-shaped necks, but the CP's neck is slightly chunkier.  The back of the neck is glossy on both guitars.  Both guitars weigh approximately the same.<br /><br />The Jazzmaster is a quirky guitar with many idiosyncrasies.  For many Jazzmaster fans (myself included), those idiosyncrasies are part of the instrument's appeal, but others would rather not have to deal with them.  If you belong to the later camp, the Classic Player Jazzmaster may be the perfect Jazzmaster for you.  Don't be put off by the \\"Made in Mexico\\" label.  These days, the Mexican made Fenders are every bit as good as the Japanese imports.
