I like the sound of a tube amp distortion best no doubt about it.But when I have the gain dimed out on 10,sometimes I want even more gain!I have a tube 1988 Marshall Artist 4203 combo 1X12.It is like a cheaper cousin to a JCM 800 & made at the same time,but not as good.I wanted the most high gain death metal pedal I could find and this one was it!!!I watched just about all distortion pedal and pedal shootout videos on youtube with some high quality headphones.None had as much gain as this one did.With this mean SOB you get most lethal amount of distortion metal you can find.There is also a pedal called \\"The Triple Wreck\\" made by Wampler.I thought it sounded great too,but for $200 it is twice as much.I am so obsessed with different sounds,I think I am going to start collecting guitar pedals like baseball cards.But if you are looking for the Terminator of distortion boxes,try this one out and it is also analog distortion MXR claims?I really like the 3 band EQ and the mids scoop.Plug it in,fire it up and palm mute some power chords.Just for a cheap thrill I fired up my Tubescreamer with the Fullbore Metal together,and I thought I was going to over load my amp with gain haha.But listen to a distortion pedal shootout on youtube.Maybe this epic ultra gain monster might be for you.And I like the metal casing of this grenade.Feels like it is built like a tank
