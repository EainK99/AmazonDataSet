This is such a beautiful native American flute. It is signed by the maker too. I hope I can do it justice. Love that I can do 5 or 6 holes, and there are lot's of great songs included with it.  I think it's going to take me a while to get used to the breath control. Anyone would love to own this beautiful flute, don't hesitate if you are thinking about getting one.
