Wheels were a great replacement for my subwoofer cabinets, which used a hard, smaller wheel.  These wheels are more like rollerblade wheels, and they glide nicely along surfaces.  My only issue is that they will leave a bit of a mark on certain types of flooring if you drag them instead of rolling them... but you shouldn't drag your subs.
