To start off I gave 5 stars because my package arrived on day on the second business day is shipped on a Monday morning and I had it by Tuesday afternoon. I was worried that it wouldn't be 50ft because amazon can be funny like that sometimes but, it was was exactly what I ordered. I already have it connected and set up and it works with no issues at all I generally don't write reviews cause im lazy but I made the extra effort for this product so order it and enjoy.
