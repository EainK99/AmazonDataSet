If, like me, you can't buy the wall hangers/holders because you can't put a hole in the wall, then this is a very good option. This works as it should. I like the smaller size which makes it more portable. It can easily fit into a guitar case or even a purse.  You do need to put it in a secure area because the guitar can be knocked off if someone bumps into the stand or guitar it is holding. It's a very basic guitar stand which holds both electric and acoustic guitars although the acoustic does seem to fit better on it.
