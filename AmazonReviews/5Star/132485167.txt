My wife wanted to start her own karaoke business and since she didn't have time or experience to set up a system, I got to do it.  I looked at TV stands and this one is awesome.  We use a flat panel computer monitor instead of a tube TV to its very light weight but I am 100% sure it would hold a heavy tube TV.  After all, it held my 25 pound child when she climbed on it.  The mic holders are made of flexible rubber so they can comform to fit any mic.  I would recommend leaving the drink holder off of it since you don't want liquid around electronics.  The stand breaks down into multible pieces so its easy to travel with. Overall I love this stand.
