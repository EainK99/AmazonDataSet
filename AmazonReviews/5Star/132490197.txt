While recording a training video I was experiencing severe sibilance and plosives.  Someone suggested employing a pop filter to reduce the plosives, and angling the microphone to reduce sibilance.  I purchased this pop filter because of its dual screens and price.  And I could not be happier with the results.  This device completely eliminated the plosives.
