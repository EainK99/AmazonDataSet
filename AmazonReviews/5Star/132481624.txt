I use these Japanese made picks due to the high quality material and superb edge bevel.<br />This particular style is ever so slightly smaller than the familiar 351 teardrops.  At 1.5 mm these are simply stiff, not a bit of flex. Yet, they produce a moderate attack, not bright, but full and round.  The smaller size gives a very good feel for cross picking and movement between strings.  I use these to play jazz, and reading music, as i have better control and precision when my eyes are off the fingerboard.  I have used them too to play fiddle tunes and Celtic on my mandolin, and they give a fine round warm sound, and again great feel as to string positions.<br /><br />The material is, cellulose, and yet it feels thick, smooth, almost polished and luxurious and the point and bevel are smooth and fast.  I have used these picks for over a decade in jazz, and occasionally rock too, and love them.  I miss the old hot pink color and the current black and white offerings seem dull, and certainly harder to spot among my picks or on the table, or floor.<br /><br />Well worth trying.  I think you may find a new favorite pick for single string work. While I have strummed using these, they are a bit small, and due to the stiffness are likely not well suited for this.  The small size and stiffness may cause them to dig into strings a bit more, but for chopping on a mando, or even comping on my archtop, they do give quite a bark, but over an hour, are fatiguing in this application, as I really need to hold tightly.  Just the opposite however, for single string or lighter playing.<br /><br />Great material, wonderfully smooth edges.
