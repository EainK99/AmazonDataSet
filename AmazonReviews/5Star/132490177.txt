I ordered these for our church primary.  The kids LOVED them!  The colors made it easy to learn new songs and the bells are sturdy enough to withstand some \\"eager\\" players.  Teens and adults enjoy them, as well.  We have had fun for all ages at church and in my own home.  I would add that we have basically used the 8 bell kit, which would suffice for those that need to save money.  But the 5 bell extension is an excellent buy and will allow us to have more musical options in our primary.  Overall, great buy!
