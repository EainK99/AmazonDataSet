I saw the preview ad for it on Vandoren's site.  I preordered from a different site, and when they came in and I got to actually try it, I was pleasantly surprised by the feel and sound of these reeds!  I usually like vandoren traditional blues, and have tried the V12's and Rue Lepics in the past.  But they both left me wanting....I couldn't put my finger on it.  These new V21's have a great response with a lot of warmth to the sound.  My first box was the 3.5+ and it played well on my M13lyre, but some were a little too hard for my embouchure. So I decided to finally try slightly softer reeds and I finally got the sound and feel I was looking for.  Just right.  They are quite expensive compared to the traditional, but definitely worth the extra price.  My reeds have lasted longer and continue to have that warmth in sound that I like, with months of use.
