I own an older rsq karaoke machine that came with two pretty heavy duty microphones (with on/off switch and replaceable cord).  thought they were ok over the years.  always wondered why the vocals sounded a little flat.  but seeing it was a medium priced machine, I lived with it.  wanting to record to digital media instead of cassette, I recently replaced it with a martin-ranger deck.  it came with two decent microphones.  not as good as the rsq's but I thought useable.  they just didn't sound good.  so I go searching around amazon and find this pyle microphone.  it sounds much cleaner than the microphones I own.  price is great too!!!  if you have a karaoke machine I recommend these as they very clear.  price is great too!!!  I will watch the price and pick another up for sure.  way better than what comes with a lot of karaoke machines!! if you own a karaoke machine and are not fond of the sound-give this microphone a try.  I think you'll like it!!!!  ******it DOESN'T have an on/off switch (I can live with that)*********it DOES come with a fairly long (10-15ft) REPLACEABLE cord**********don't think you can go wrong here for the price (I paid $10.29 shipped through prime).
