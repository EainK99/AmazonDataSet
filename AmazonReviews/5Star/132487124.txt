I bought my oldest son a student trumpet when he was in 4th grade, and he was fairly abusive with it for the first couple years - as he was with almost all his belongings! But it served its purpose until last year when his skill level had improved to the point where he needed an upgrade. I was wary of buying another instrument that was at the lower end of the pricing scale, but our budget requires it.<br /><br />I was impressed with the number of positive reviews I had found for this model, and based my purchase solely on its reputation as a quality instrument for the money. I have not been disappointed. My son has now used it for approximately 8 months in concert band, jazz band, and marching band. He takes good care of it and his instructors gave it a thumbs up for quality and sound. I can tell that his playing has improved greatly with the use of this instrument, and I am very pleased to have found it. Now that my youngest son is also beginning trumpet lessons at school, I won't hesitate to purchase this model again in the future!
