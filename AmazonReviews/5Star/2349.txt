My favorite strings! Great tone! I play an Ibanez AFJ85 hollowbody, the D'Addario Jazz Light Chromes have a warm mellow tone which is great since my guitar is naturally bright being a hollowbody. The texture of the flat wounds are smooth and easy on the fingers, perfect for rhythm and lead, especially if you play fast. These are the longest lasting strings I've played, I change them out about every 2-3 months and I play my guitar almost daily. Im a worship leader at church, the strings sound great playing live on stage. My main style of playing is a mix of rockabilly and old school punk, but they're also perfect for jazz and blues. I first learned about these strings when I bought my guitar a few years ago, they came stock. Been using the D'Addario Jazz Light Chromes ever since! I have heard of people using them on solid bodies but I have not tried flat wounds on my solid body guitars. But I do recommend them on hollowbodies.
