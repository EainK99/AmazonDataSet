Wow. I needed to quiet down my Marshall TSL 100, 1960A/B full stack. I knew a quarter stack would do the trick. I thought about shelling out $700 for a Marshall 1936 cab, but I wanted something different. I wanted to try Celestion Vintage 30's. I bought 2 eight ohm Vintage 30's from Sweetwater and wired them in series for a 16 ohm quarter stack. One of the best choices I made.<br /><br />This is a great product. It may be cheap, but if you know what you are doing this empty cab will do the trick. No instructions are included, but the wiring is straight forward. If you know how you want your cab set up.
