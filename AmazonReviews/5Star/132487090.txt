I purchased these for my 6-month old; his face lights up with pure joy for every shake.  My toddler and her love to play with them too. These egg shakers are really well made; they stand up to quite a bit of abuse from my small children who are constantly dropping them on the floor.  Also, there is something about the tinkling sound they make that makes them more popular with my kids than other shakers or maracas.
