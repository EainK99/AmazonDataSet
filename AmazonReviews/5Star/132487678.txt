I received my Yamaha DGX-640C with pedals and bench August 15th, 2011, and I have played it every day since then. Sometimes nearly all day, trying to hear not what is prescribed in a book or score, but what is within me in my compositional work.<br /><br />At first I was a little alarmed at the force required to depress the keys.  However, my piano teacher assured me I would learn to appreciate that. Vladimir Horowitz liked a Steinway requiring only 46 grams, while Arthur Rubenstein preferred a force more like my Yamaha of 65 grams.  I have since played a one-hundred-thousand-dollar Steinway grand, a two-hundred-thousand-dollar Fazioli, a Bosendorfer, Yamah acoustic pianos, and many other acoustic and digital pianos.<br /><br />All acoustic pianos are different from each other and all brands and models of digital pianos are different from each other.  While I am far from an accomplished pianist of any sort, that is why virtuoso pianists meticulously choose their instruments.<br /><br />As you learn to play an instrument you will discover the principles even the greatest have encountered.  If you are a pianist, you know this well.  The more you experience, the more you perceive, and the more you appreciate the virtuosos and the music they perform.<br /><br />When trying a piano I try to be alone, do my best to shut out all outside sounds, as well as playing familiar pieces, chords and arpeggios, I put my ear close to the keyboard at all ranges and in particular at C-5 and C-6 and listen to the action as the keys strike and return, feel the linkage. I listen to the overtones of the pitches, bass to the upper range, wanting the instrument to sound like the sound I expect from a piano, irrespective of what a salesperson, or advertising says.<br /><br />The actions of some digital pianos make a terrible racket.  Others are too creamy, gooey, or syrupy, lacking feel. Try one or more of the great acoustic grand pianos.  Try to feel the mechanical linkage.  Some sound veryrich, others lack overtones, sounding like electronic sine wave tone generators.<br /><br />The oft repeated \\"It sounds and feels more like an acoustic piano.\\" is ridiculous, since all accoustic pianos are different from each other.  Try a humble up-right that's been beaten to death, or an historical instrument from the eighteen hundreds or ealier, and of course, one or more contemporary Steinway or Yamaha grands, even a Fazioli.<br /><br />I like my DGX-640's action because it feels alive, not creamy, nor loose as a goose.  Some pianists have mentioned a rebound. Pianos with strings do rebound the hammers.  How much is too much?  Try to feel this and decide what you like.  Same with the sound. Even an expensive acoustic piano may lack overtones in some ranges. I like the quality of the tones and the harmonic overtones thoughout the range of my DGX-640.  It may have some faults but I find them trivial and requiring in-depth analysis for my perception, and like my adult children, it's mine.<br /><br />Also, having a background in studio work and electronics, I've modified my setup for acoustic recording with large diaphragm condenser mikes to pick up the left and right speakers of my DGX-640, careful mike placement, also adding a quality multichannel digital mixer and recorder, feedback amplifiers, and additional condenser mikes for my voice, so that for me, I have a deeply resonant Steinway equivalent, and a quality, compact recording studio.<br /><br />I feel in-part with my instrument and can feel the resonance in my stocking feet pressed against the pedals unit.  It's my instrument.<br /><br />My recommendation:  Read as many Amazon customer reviews and manufacturers' specs as you can.  Try as many instruments as you can.  For you, your instrument should become a part of you and your ultimate musical expression.  If an instrument for someone else, same for your loved one.  The Yamaha DGX-640 has done that for me.<br /><br />I will now go back to my instrument formaybe a couple more hours.
