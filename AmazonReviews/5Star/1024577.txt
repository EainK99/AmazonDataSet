For the cost, this recorder is lovely. Actually, there are only two things that I feel as problems for professional recording situations:<br />1. It has no separated level control knobs for each channel. You have to select a channel first, and then modify its level with the knob you see next to the pause button. That's a mess when you are recording 4 or 5 things at the same time. Most of the times you can prevent what's going to happen with the sound source, so you can level everything before the actual recording, but when it's not like that, it's pretty difficult to react.<br />2. It has no XLR output, though it has RCA separated outputs. That's pretty useful in shootings where you want to send an audio mix to the camera so it's already synced.
