This thing is amazingly clear.  I have never had any issue with being heard while using this device.<br />The only con is that it is TOO sensitive for certain scenarios.  If you are using this in an environment with background noise, it will pickup that background noise very, very well.<br />Device itself feels very sturdy and dense/heavy.  Bottom is nicely padded so that it won't &#34;clink&#34; or scrape against whatever surface it sits upon.  USB cable is detachable from the actual unit (which can be handy), and is quite long - which is a nice touch in the age of too-short cables from manufacturers.<br />Very happy with this product!
