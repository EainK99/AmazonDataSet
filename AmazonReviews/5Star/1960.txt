The B-3 is probably not what you want if you have a Casino Coupe or other small hollow body. Without front roller the break angle for the strings is pretty shallow. if you are an aggressive player you are going to be knocking some strings out of  saddle slots.  You may want to consider a Bigsby with front roller to increase string angle.
