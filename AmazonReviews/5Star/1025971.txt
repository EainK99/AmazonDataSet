I've just had it for one day....But it seems to work great! Pretty easy to navigate through...Comes with paper instructions, and the company itself sends you instructions via internet before the item arrives. Batteries included....Nifty travel case....Kickstand built in....Power saver shut-off....Small enough to fit in guitar case. $25 seems a fair price for what you get....Time will tell as to durability.
