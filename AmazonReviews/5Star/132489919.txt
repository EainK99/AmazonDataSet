I am not really a drummer, so I had no stick allegiance when I recently purchased a Yamaha DTX520 electronic drum kit to do some home recording.  I tried several types of sticks more or less at random, including some (the Zildjian Trigger stick) specifically recommended for electronic drums.  Once I tried the Vic Firth eStick, I put away all the others and ordered three more pair.  The sticks are light and feel very fast, but are substantial enough for heavier playing.  Either because of their weight of flexibility, they seem to reduce the shock of playing on relatively unyielding pads, and are very comfortable to use.  I am completely satisfied with them and won't be trying any other stick unless these are discontinued (which, unfortunately, tends to happen with products I like).
