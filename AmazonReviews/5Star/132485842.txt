It works. You wouldn't expect that for the price you pay, so that alone is something. I recommend it to people who want to give violin a try, but are not ready to commit to an expensive instrument. It's perfectly fine to get the feel of it and to learn the basics. THEN once you decide that the violin is for you, invest in quality.
