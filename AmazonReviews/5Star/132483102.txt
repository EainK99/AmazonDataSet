I have OWNED and Used tone of these units for OVER 10 Years (More like 13-15 years)SAME UNIT was Repaired only ONCE with NO PROBLEMS, has the BEST ACOUSTICAL Characteristics (Low Noise) (Except for mp3 and Sample playback) CLEANEST Reproduction of Equalized and Unequalized Sound.  Built in Mp3 player reads up to 512mb external card, have done HOURS ALONE playing music from Mixer, and can Buy you time in case of technical difficulties.  Only after Owning this Unit for about 7 years did I discover and start using the Digital Sampler.<br /><br />Take it from me as a TRUE AUDIO GURU and PROFESSIONAL.  THIS HANDS DOWN is the BEST MIXER I have EVER OWNED, and I ONLY WISH they hadn't discontinued this Unit.  I AM looking for a 2nd one to have as a Backup.<br /><br />\\"Music Man\\"
