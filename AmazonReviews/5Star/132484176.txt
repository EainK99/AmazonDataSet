Purchased to use with a used Vito alto sax.  My son found this very comfortable and easy to use.  I like it so much, I am replacing my scratchy old &#34;unpadded&#34; tenor sax strap with one of these.  I cannot believe I put up with something uncomfortable for so many years when something like this was available.
