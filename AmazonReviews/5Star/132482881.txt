I've been using this for about 3 months now.  Works great.  If you leave the area and come back it seems to have an issue re-synching to the phone but the fix is to simply press the power button on the ION to switch it off and then back on.  My Bluetooth in my car acts the same way so I think this is more of an iphone 4 issue than the ION itself.  Normally I pair my phone to it when I get in first thing in the morning and it stays connected all day unless I leave the office and come back.  Then it's just a quick power off / on and its good to go again.  Wish it had a mute button.
