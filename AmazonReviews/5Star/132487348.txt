I've wanted to learn to play ukulele for awhile. Finally, I caved and decided to splurge on this ukulele last month. I love it! It's my new favorite toy. ;) Like some of the other reviewers, I recommend buying nice strings to put on it for best sound results, so you don't get discouraged by the less-than-quality sound that the plastic strings they come with make while you're trying to learn.
