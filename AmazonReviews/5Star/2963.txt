I have the Mustang 3 already. It's great for practice and small venues, but I find I'm needing something with more volume that can cut through the mix. This is why I ordered the Mustang 5. It is a workhorse and a room shaker. The Celestion speakers in the cab don't lose any clarity at higher volumes. The amp models in this amp are outstanding. The 4 button footswitch is a great tool for use with this amp. I'm absolutely pleased with my purchase.
