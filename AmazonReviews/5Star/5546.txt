Ok, here is the deal. I was clueless when I began the search for LED Par Cans. I chose these because they came with a remote control and I could get away with not buying a control board or trying to program them on the back of the light. Plus the price was right. I think they may be equivalent to a 38 par, but don't quote me. I bought these to go inside light boxes to help create a fun atmosphere in our children's church area. They have worked great for this purpose. If I ever need to buy more, I will buy this brand again. There is a feature that allows the colors to change with sound, however, I don't use it because it needs to be beside a speaker. I would suggest that if you want them to change color to the music, to get the control board, and use the dmx (or whatever its called) cord to connect all lights together and plug into the speaker.
