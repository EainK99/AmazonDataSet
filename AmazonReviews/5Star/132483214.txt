We use headsets because we are older and want individual control on the volume.  I saw this product on line several months ago during a quest to find a way to get better sound.  I did not purchase it at that time because I did not think such an inexpensive product was going to help.  Then a close lightening strike fried the $300.00++ amplifier we were using at the time.  We took a chance and purchased this product and now have the best sound reception we have had since everything went digital.  We highly recommend it to anyone who wants to boost headphone reception.
