What an amazing and inexpensive way to get into multi track recording without having to lug around a computer !  I am a member of the crossover generation, and still remember my TASCAM 4 track cassette.  I used the puppy for years while touring.  This new 8 track is half the size of my old 4 track, quicker to operate, more efficient, and sounds AWESOME !!!
