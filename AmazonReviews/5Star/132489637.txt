This is a fantastic piano for the price. Sound quality is excellent. I really like variety of sound adjustment which include Hammer Response(Fast, Grand piano feel - is my favorite, Slightly slower, Slow), String resonance (suppressed, slightly suppressed, reverberation - also my favorite, strong reverberation), Lid Simulator (Lid closed, Lid opened slightly, Lid fully open - also my favorite, Lid removed),  and probably the best feature/innovation is ability to physically open the top Lid just like in the real acoustic piano and it make a huge difference in sound.<br />This piano is as good as it gets for $1000 and similar YAMAHA models cost well over $2500 and still do not have 256 note polyphony like this model. Another plus is that you get 3 years warranty from Casio if you register in 30 days after purchase. It just shows how serious Casio has become in electronic piano business. I highly recommend this instrument!
