This controller is just amazing. The whole feel of the unit is just, amazing. I'm really at a loss of words of how amazing the unit is but I can surely tell you that it is not an easy controller to learn. If you;re upgrading from a 2-deck controller to this, you will have a little difficulty (my situation right now). Serato DJ is OK, I do think Traktor is better in my opinion, but I only had this for a day, so my opinion is subject to change at any given moment. The unit is very sturdy, the jog wheels are just out of this world. Sound quality is pristine. You can hop right in and start mixing, no troubles, very easy set-up.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: THIS CONTROLLER IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED FOR YOUR LAPTOP ONLY, MEANING THAT YOU WILL NEED HEADPHONES OR AN EXTERNAL SPEAKER TO HEAR WHAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH WITH THE CONTROLLER. Luckily, I bought headphones along with this controller (you will need one anyways since it's a 4-deck controller). ALSO NOT FOR BEGINNERS. Beginners should get their feet wet with a native instruments controller in my opinion. You can't just go in head first, it's like stepping into a hot tub.<br /><br />Overall, don't hesitate to buy this controller. Save your money and get this controller, don;t settle for numark, don;t even settle for native instruments (which is a very good brand), this is the top of the line.
