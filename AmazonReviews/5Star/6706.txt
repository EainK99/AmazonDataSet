Really like these strings so far.  I can't comment on their longevity as of yet, they've only been on my bass for two weeks.  I love the feel of these strings and the tension is a bit lower than the other 45-105 strings I've tried.  I really can use my fingers more easily to play softer or louder, depending on the song.  They also have a tone I've found in no other bass strings-sweet highs, great mids and booming lows.  I've been playing a Sterling Sub Ray 4 in church for a year, and I've tried lots of bass strings.  I've had more compliments on my tone using these strings and the Ernie Ball 45-105 strings over any other strings.  If you're looking for something different in your bass tone, give these a try.  They may surpass the Ernie Ball Hybrid's as my go to string if they last a long time.<br /><br />PS-the Dunlop electric guitar strings are great, too!
