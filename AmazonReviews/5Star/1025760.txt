An excellent flip-switch at considerably lower price than you'll pay for the &#34;name brand&#34; versions.  Fits fine on Fender-type guitar plates.  Includes screws for mounting.  Good quality switch.  It is best to purchase these in quantity due to the high shipping charge (shipping remains the same up to qty 30).
