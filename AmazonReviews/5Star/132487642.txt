I am a piano teacher and this book series has always been my choice because the four books in the set make a complete piano course.  The Technic book is a book of skill building exercises that can be used for warm ups. The Theory book is a workbook-like book that allows the student to study the music concepts such as notes so they understand them when they see them in their music.  The Piano book takes the concepts learned in the theory book and introduces them in their lesson's songs.  The Performance book contains fun, slightly longer songs that are intended for the final mastery of lesson concepts.  All of the books are complete with fun illustrations that go with the songs and concepts.<br /><br />This Primer level is the level I use for my second graders.  It begins with practicing on sets of black keys then works into the C position.  It has a number of variations of songs students recognize which helps them learn the songs faster, and they can proudly tell their parents that they can play that song.  Some pieces include a duet accompaniment for the teacher to play with the student upon mastery of the piece.  The concepts are introduced at a steady pace that will not overwhelm students, but can be increased to adapt to quick learners.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this level and the complete Bastien Piano Basics series to anyone looking for a complete piano course.  I learned to play the piano with this series and found the concepts I learned from these books set a wonderful stage for advancement into the intermediate series.
