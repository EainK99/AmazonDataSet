Best value for a pre-cut nut out there. Lubricated so you don't have to worry about binding strings. Just sand down the bottom until it's the right height and go for it. Graph Tech has guides on their website on how to fit one. Easy peasy upgrade for your Epiphone. Note that Epiphone, in mid 2014, changed their guitars so that their nut slots are now too low for this model. Graph Tech knows about this and is working on a new nut that will fit the newer Epiphones. Until then, you can use something like a piece of a credit card to ship it up.
