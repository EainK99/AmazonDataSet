I haven't played my oboe in about 30 years, so naturally my reed was a horrible piece of straw when my mother sent it to me.<br />Local shop wanted $18 for a reed, and while that is probly reasonable after this much time, I didn't want to spend that just to see if I could still play.<br />Seller made a pointed announcement that the reed was coming from China and that delivery would take about two weeks - no rush for me, as again I haven't played in 30 years...<br />The NEXT DAY my reed was delivered!<br />Not the best quality ever, but more than sufficient for my needs - and to confirm that I still stink as an oboist ... :(<br />Will buy again if I can bring myself to play more... :)<br />Thanks for a great option for out of the loom players.
