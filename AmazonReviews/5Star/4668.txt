The device works as advertised and it works well.  Tempo and beat patterns are easy to set and easy to hear. My nine-year old daughter is able to set it and use it without difficulty to support her practice - which is the reason we purchased it.  It is attractively priced and offers more features than many other devices that are more costly.
