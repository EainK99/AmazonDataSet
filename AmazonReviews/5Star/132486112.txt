I'm a professional musician, and I've been relying on this little wonder for years.  I set it up on simple pre-programmed beats and run it through a foot pedal.  It works like a charm.  It's so good for practice, every player should get one for that reason alone.  The swing/shuffle beats work easily compared to some other machines I've tried (and failed) to make work properly.  If you're in a solo or acoustic-oriented group and need a beat for performances, or if you're looking for something easy and workable for practice, or if you need a high-function machine to record demos, you have to have this, period.  The next best thing is a real drummer--if the drummer is good.
