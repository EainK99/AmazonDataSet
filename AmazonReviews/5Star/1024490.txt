Awesome little device. Amplitude of the headphone output is strong enough to power my over-the-ear headphones. The microphones work very nicely. I used this to conduct interviews, and placed the DR-05 on the table just out of frame. With some proper noise cancellation techniques, it sounded amazing, MUCH better than the camera microphone! My only complaint is the mysterious &#34;mark&#34; feature. Apparently you can use the mark button while recording to create marks in the audio file, for example you might make a mark after each question is answered in an interview, which can come in handy during editing, but I never figured out how to view these marks. I couldn't find any help in the manual, user guide, or online.
