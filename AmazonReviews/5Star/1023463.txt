There are many other reviews you can read that go into greater detail about all the specs on these things, but this is not one of those reviews.<br /><br />I have a set for home (my old plain ATH-M50 which I have had for 2 years) and a set for work (this pair, the ATH-M50x). I can't really tell the difference (if any) in sound quality as the speakers are pretty much identical. I bought the M50x pair for work and wear them about 6-7 hours a day. I have a rather fat head but these are still incredibly comfortable after hours of wear.<br /><br />I have several points I like to make about these headphones:<br /><br />1 - These sound good (like really good, with all types of audio AND that sound quality does NOT seem to fade over time)<br /><br />2 - These headphones are very comfortable (however, you do need to wear them for a little while so that they form to your head)<br /><br />3 - While these are very comfortable, if your head/ears perspire (sweat), you should remove them every so often so that your ears do not become a swamp (the plastic/leather cups tend to form a rather good seal around your ears)<br /><br />Bottom line: I would wear these all the time if I did not have to interact with people every so often. The quality you get for the price (keep an eye on the sales too) is totally worth it.<br /><br />2 year edit:<br /><br />After 2 years of using these almost every day at my desk, they are still going strong. The white pair did have a little bit of flaking on the top of the head band, but it is purely cosmetic, and even then, very minor.<br /><br />I also use my older black pair when I travel, and they still sound the same, 4 years later.<br /><br />Only complaint I have is that your ears can get a little sweaty if you wear these for too long, but that still rarely happens.<br /><br />If you are on the fence, buy these, you will not regret it. (But keep in mind, these are not noise cancelling and they are not some hyped up high bass speakers on a band. They are mid-level, balanced, durable, and all around great sounding multipurpose headphones)are mid-level, balanced, durable, and all around great sounding multipurpose headphones)
