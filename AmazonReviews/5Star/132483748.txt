These cans are so comfortable, I find myself preferring to wear them when they're around even when not listening to anything. THEY ARE THAT COMFORTABLE.<br />It's hard to believe I got these for a little over $160, as they feel like something that is sold for over $300 (that's what my friends estimated them to be when they held them and wore them).<br />These things are built like tanks, and I've read previous reviewers saying they've had their Beyers for 10+ years, that's how long I intend to keep them and even if they did no last that long I cannot imagine myself buying another brand after experiencing how ridiculously comfy these things are. They grow on you and soon you'll realize you don't want to wear anything else. My next upgrade will most likely be to the Beyerdynamic Tesla lineup.<br />The only complaint I have is that the soundstage I expected out of these headphones was a lot bigger.. Having coupled the open back DT 990 pro's with the -soundstage enhancing-  fiio e17, I expected a much wider soundstage. But I guess I overestimated the limitations of open back headphones and was expecting unrealistic results.<br />The mids on these cans are indeed recessed as I noticed after comparing them with my px200-ii and HD202 , (female vocals are more apparent at low volumes on the cheaper models, whereas on the Beyers the instruments are more pronounced and far more separated) still, I really like the &#34;fun&#34; V-shaped frequency response of these cans, Superb for movies and TV. The sound is quite bright but in a beautiful precise way, I was never disturbed by the higher &#34;highs&#34;and the leap at around 10KHz just makes them sound more precise, no harshness whatsoever.<br />As for the &#34;clamp force&#34; on the pro model, I have not experienced such a thing, like I said earlier I could wear these all day long with no fatigue. I live in an arid climate and the weather is usually over 35 in summer and reaches below 20 celsius during winter, the open back design allows my ears to &#34;breathe&#34; when it's hot, and the &#34;pillow-ish&#34; pads warm my ears when it's cold. So you could say they can be used at any climate.<br />I cannot imagine a better deal out there for sub $200 headphones, sure there are the M50's and the k701's but though I haven't tried those models I imagine the DT990's are in a higher league as their retail price suggests.design allows my ears to &#34;breathe&#34; when it's hot, and the &#34;pillow-ish&#34; pads warm my ears when it's cold.
