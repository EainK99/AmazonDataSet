I've owned several mid-high end headphones over the years, and a moderate audio enthusiast. I didn't mind spending a good chunk of cash, if it really made a difference. These are easily the best headphones I've owned, or heard in the price range. Comfortable and easy to wear for hours on end. I plug mine into an M-stage amplifier, and the sound is phenomenal. As with most things in this price range, though, if you're interested you should really try out all options available. Listen to some sennheiser or beyerdynamic models in comparable price ranges and see what works best for you.
