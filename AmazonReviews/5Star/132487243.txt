Decent build quality, although EHX has stopped supplying hex nuts on their microswitches. The \\"manual\\" switch is just loose, supported only by the circuit board.<br />My first Neo Clone had a hex nut, but second one did not, nor does this one. I guess that 5 cents adds up when you're selling thousands of units.<br /><br />As for the sound, for one, when pedal is engaged, even when depth is all the way at 0, it adds some high end. But it has surprisingly low noise, so putting it in front of distortion doesn't really add hiss.<br /><br />The wah sounds pretty good when swept, but is too thin sounding to use in manual mode to boost mids for a lead. A regular crybaby left in the middle position is thicker.<br /><br />The phase has a weird pattern to the LFO. It's not a smooth transition. You get a weird bump at one end. Not smooth like a phase 90. Sounds cool in front of distortion, a little univibe like.<br /><br />Tremolo sounds pretty good. It doesn't get too intense, but has a nice smooth sweep.<br /><br />Vibrato is my favorite (although I initially bought it for the phase). Really nice effect. Intense, but doesn't detune your sound too much. Nice for clean playing, and in front of distortion.<br /><br />24 volt power is a PITA, but can be powered by two outlets of a Pedal Power.<br /><br />I originally bought it because I need a phaser for my second board, and thought this would be more versatile. But the phase isn't what I'm looking for (but not bad), as I am looking for a smoother phase for clean rhythm guitar.<br /><br />I would say the strength of this pedal is how great it sounds in front of distortion pedals or a distorted amp. It's a quiet pedal, and the slight boost in the highs allows the FX to come through the distortion. You can get some pretty cool sounds.<br /><br />Overall, for the money, it's a great deal. You get a lot of analog bang for the buck.
