It's well made, looks exactly as pictured, and it came in protective styrofoam case+packing peanuts.<br />It also comes with a bit of purple string to tie it around your neck, but I wouldn't wear it casually as a necklace, the string could come undone and it'd fall.<br />.<br />Also, if you're worried about sound, it really helps to know a bit about playing instruments that require breath control before playing this, but even rookies could get used to it quickly. You can go really sharp or flat if you put too little/too much breath into it, like any other wind instrument.<br />The high notes ARE a little hard, but playing with sharper breath helps. Instead of just breathing, try making a &#34;TOOH&#34; sound.<br />It also comes with a guide for fingerings for beginners, and some songs to play. The songs aren't LOZ related though, but if you're good at playing by ear they're not hard to figure out.<br />Overall:<br />Design: 10/10<br />'Playability': 9/10
