I play bluegrass and rock.  For a long time I have known that guitarists who are very fast use heavy picks, which keep your wrist flexible.  Only recently, have I tried these Big Stubby picks, which are fantastic. My speed has increased by about 20%.  They don't slip from your fingers like other thin picks.  The indentation gives a firm grip so you are not likely to drop a pick while playing.  I tried the purple 3 mm picks, which are made with very hard plastic but decided their tone was too harsh.  I took them back, substituting them for the nylon versions. These I recommend!
