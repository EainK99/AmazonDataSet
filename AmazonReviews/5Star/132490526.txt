Plain and simple this is a great instrument made with care. The Indonesian factory where they make this also makes many other excellent instruments and I am particularly fond of the neck they are producing (check out some of the Sterling by Music Man instruments also made in this place).  This bass has very good tone, versatility found in the electronics, comfortable to play and is available in various beautiful finishes. Suitable for beginners and experienced musicians who don't want to break the bank. Perfect to pair with a fender bass amplifier for live applications... If you are looking for a bass and you are on a tight budget this is the best road to take.. Take it from a 20+ years of experience musician who has tried a lot of other brands from entry level to pro.. Yamaha is making a very competitive product.
