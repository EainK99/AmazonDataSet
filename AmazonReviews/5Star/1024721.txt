These speakers have been one of my favorite purchases in the last two years. I was looking for high quality sound, integrated amplification, and an affordable price point. These speakers deliver on all of those points.<br /><br />My application is simple: I wanted to have excellent quality for music listening in my bedroom but did not want the additional footprint of a subwoofer. The 8&#34; woofers give excellent low frequency reproduction without the typical distortion found at similar price points. My extreme sensitivity to high frequencies makes most speakers unbearable to me but these deliver a smooth high frequency response that is clear without sounding harsh.<br /><br />I honestly could NOT be happier with my purchase.
