My friend had one of these, so I purchased one for myself.  it is fantastic!  It shipped fast and it is really a good machine to use for weekend get-togethers with friends.  it came with three karaoke CD's...the one is a total waste...all little kids songs sung in hi-sorprano, but the others are good, standard songs.  We have since added more CD's to our collection.
