I am a bit skeptical at first, so I emailed Kennedy Violins for more info.<br />The reply was very quick, but with great courtesy and professionalism.<br />So I ordered one right away.<br /><br />The violin arrived in great packaging and great condition.<br />Such an underpriced violin for a product with this quality.<br />Case and other bell and whistle are also good quality product.<br /><br />Now it has been 1 month since my daughter first use it., and my daughter really love it and eager to be back to her violin class soon in September.
