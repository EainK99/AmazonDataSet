I'm a guitar with tendonitis issues in both hands. So this pick came in handy when training for speed. It really helped ease me from forcing too much on holding the pick too tight, and helped me balance my speed with my left. And the cool thing is I can hook it up to my pick holder either on the guitar or on my belt loop.<br /><br />Very good product.
