Easy enough to use. Fill it and go! Definitely puts out plenty of smoke and lasts forever. I'm using swamp juice at the moment. Only flaw would be the remote. I'd prefer to have more of a foot pedal remote myself. The switch is a bit difficult to use via your foot as we're using this with a live band.
