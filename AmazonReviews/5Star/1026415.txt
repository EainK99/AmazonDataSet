No issues.  Just works as expected.  I use them to connect two mixers, and as mono outs to go into keyboard amp.  Sound is good, connectors fit snugly.  Excellent shielding from what I notice.  Having 16GA is nice as it makes the wire feel thick and durable.  At 41 cents per foot (what I paid in Aug 2015), the price is not bad for what you get.  There are some cheaper deals on Amazon, for instance Seismic Audio has the same 1/4&#34; TS  to 1/4 inch TS wire as low as 22 cents per foot for a pack of eight 25' wires but I'm not sure if it is 16 gauge like the are.  I was actually surprised at the quality as I was expecting something more cheaply made.  Will certainly buy again as needed.
