I bought this to go with my Legacy bass. Wanted a compact, flexible, reliable, good sounding amp as a beginner/practice amp. I am not disappointed in the least. Solid construction, stable, nice adjustability for tone and overdrive. Low noise floor and hum/buzz. A really good unit that I've been very pleased with so far. I use it mostly while practicing in my study. Great amp at a great price.
