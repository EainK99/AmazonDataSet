I used this to give a seminar out on our fish farm because I was afraid my voice wouldn't carry over the sounds of fountains, etc. to a large group of people in an outdoor setting.  This unit appears well made, and it worked perfectly!  As an added bonus you can use it as an outdoor speaker for music on an ipod, etc.  Comes with a bag that stows everything in its place and I wasn't expecting that. If I were to improve it, I would add a 2nd transmitter as an option so folks can ask questions and be heard as well.  All in all I am very glad I purchased it.
