I haven't used many clip on tuners, but I have used a ton of different kinds of floor pedal tuners.  I play out a lot.  This is perfect for bringing to music lessons (electric, acoustic, bass, and cello)<br />Great tuner in a pinch, doesn't cost a lot and is reliable.  Batteries are cheap on amazon.  I spent $10 on a pack of 50 batteries and bought 4 tuners for my worship team at church and for home.  Excellent product!
