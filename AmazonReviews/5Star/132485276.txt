Love the sounds produced by the SE215. Very well balanced and the Bass is not too heavy but still packs a punch.<br /><br />I would say it is one of the best earphones in the under $100 group.<br /><br />Only thing to consider is the unusually long cables that comes with the SE215. I aint very tall so when im using the SE215 with my phone, the excess cables can be a hassle.<br /><br />But if you dont have a problem with cable length, i highly recommend getting the Shure SE215
