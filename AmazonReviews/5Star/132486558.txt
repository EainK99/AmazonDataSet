I bought this to use with the [[ASIN:B0002GZKWU Shure 55SH Series II Iconic Unidyne Vocal Microphone (The Elvis Microphone)]] and it works great! As other reviewers have noted, the slim shape allows for easy mounting of the microphone and easy attachment of the microphone cable. The chrome finish is also pretty classy, and goes well with my microphone's vintage look.
