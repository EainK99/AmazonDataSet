Delivered promptly, when I opened the parcel, immediately noticed how carefully packed it was. In the past, I had dealt before with musical instrument sellers that did seem to care. But this company does, and ought to be praised for it.<br /><br />The instrument was better than I expected. It is a low cost mandolin, but looks like and feels like it's more expensive, and plays well. There are better sounding on the market, but for my purposes of learning (practicing mandolin and violin), this instrument tunes easily and quickly, and is more than adequate.<br /><br />It didn't come with a case. But I will likely buy one from this company, after looking and comparing.
