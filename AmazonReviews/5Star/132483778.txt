She loved it! The pink is her favorite color, and she wants to play it whenever we get together and I can teach her. Small size is good for 5 years or older child, case is good quality with Velcro hold-down to prevent violin from shifting around during transport. Comes with extra strings and two bridges. You have to insert the bridge as it is shipped without the bridge in place. Good quality horsehair bow and chin support included. Also comes with some rosin for the bow.
