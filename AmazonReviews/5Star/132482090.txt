I've tried a few different kinds of penny-whistle, and most sound rather obnoxious...like the difference between a nasally sounding person and normal people. But seriously, this is easily a quality penny-whistle. It's made of real metal and wood too, not plastic. It arrived in just a few days, and I'm very happy with it.
