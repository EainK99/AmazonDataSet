I bought these as replacement lamps for my old Colortran Mini-Pro light kit. These are just what I was looking for. They were packaged well, fit snuggly into the lamp socket, and seem to be pretty good quality. I have used these lamps for video production, and they are just what I needed.<br /><br />If you are looking for quality lamps for a great price, this is it.<br /><br />Tyler<br />Age 22<br />Indiana
