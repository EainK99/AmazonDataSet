This violin has a great sound and is a wonderful beginner violin for adults! Highly recommend doing business with Kennedy Violins. Their customer service is top notch and they are quick to address issues and answer questions. Their rentals are incredibly affordable and you can apply rental credit up to a year towards a purchase of a violin. You can't go wrong with Kennedy!
