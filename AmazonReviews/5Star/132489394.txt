I got this to act as a marker light for my son's scooter. I wired it to turn on with the ignition and you can see this from a very long way off. As it doesn't blink or flash, it is legal (as far as I can tell) in all states and is great for more safety. I'm thinking of getting another in either clear or amber for the front. Daytime running light on a scooter!
