I own a Pro DJ business and was tired of being &#34;tied&#34; to the microphone or carrying around a wireless mic.  Picked this up to use with my Shure ULX system.  Boy was I surprised at the gain before feedback, sturdy feel and the vocal clarity!  I'm thinking it will also hold as a karaoke host microphone...we'll see. Even if it's not the right fit for singing, the hands-free option alone is well worth the $$.  It has the 4-pin shure connector for use with almost all Shure bodypack transmitters.<br /><br />No Cons yet!
