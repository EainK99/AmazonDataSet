The hard case came in a different shipment from the uke for position reasons. The hard case is well made and sturdy.<br /><br />The uke itself is absolutely beautiful. I have a Kala soprano and this tenor has a much more mellow sound. (To be expected, it's a tenor.) What is stunning is the beauty of the wood and the finish. It truly is eye candy and a pleasure just hold,  let alone play.  I am absolutely delighted with this purchase.<br /><br />There was a delay in the shipping, so I e-mailed Austin Bazaar. A prompt repy was received with an explanation for the delay. Very good customer service. I purchased the soprano from them and had the instrument within 3 days. Also in perfect condition. Both ukes came with Aquila strings, which, of course, is a big plus..
