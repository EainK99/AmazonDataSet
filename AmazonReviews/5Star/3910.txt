I am HIGHLY SATISFIED! I've wanted a ukulele for years and just now decided it was finally time to buy one. I did some research online and looked up some good ukulele brands for beginners and the Kala name kept popping up, and now I see why! It's super light, sounds amazing and super easy to play! Sure you may need to tune A LOT during the first week or so (the first day I had to tune at least every 5 minutes but that's a part of new strings) but once the strings are nice and stretched it's perfect.<br /><br />It arrived 3 days after ordering and it was in a nice box covered and taped in plastic. Once I ripped it open (I literally RIPPED because I was so excited lol) and opened the box the ukulele was already in the carrying case and the tuner was in its own packaging in the front pocket of the case.<br /><br />I honestly thought the carrying case was going to be cheap for the price, but it's actually quite sturdy! It's a pretty thick fabric and great stitching so it should last you for a while.<br /><br />The tuner is good too. I thought it was going to be bigger, but when I opened it, it was so tiny and cute! It only has one button (on/off) that you fast press to change between guitar, bass, violin, ukulele, or chromatic tuning, and then long press to turn on or off. It clips on to the ukulele very well and I know it won't slide off.<br /><br />All in all I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to everyone!
