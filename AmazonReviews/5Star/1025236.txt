Wow....are you kidding...this amp is supernatural....<br />I have a Marshall dsl100, Orange thunder , Vox AC 15, Fender deville....<br />The clean on the h and k is the best I have ever heard....all the way up and it still remains clean and shimmery....<br />The crunch channel is beautiful with clarity that is unparalleled...no sloppy playing allowed...but it makes you a better guitarist...<br />The lead channel is fat..fat..fat....no noisy breakup...super precise but full of warm harmonics...<br />This amp can be in your bedroom recording from the direct out, played at quiet levels with full tube richness at 1,5 watts .....18 watts for church,<br />and full 36 watts for face melting tonal assault......<br />Cool blue color, small footprint, carry bag...highly recommend this very special amp.....
