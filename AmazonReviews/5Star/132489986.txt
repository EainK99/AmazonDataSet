I just needed to extend the audio cable due to the design of the corner desk unit.  I looked at all the other stores for an extension.  Radio Shack, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart.  Couldn't find it.  I could have traveled about 30 mins south to a TigerDirect but I don't trust their inventory system at all.  So don't waste your time and gas and just order it.  If you need it ASAP pay the additional shipping.
