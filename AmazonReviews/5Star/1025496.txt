I used to think of flangers as kind of a joke novelty item, like the giant foam fingers of the guitar world. The first time you hear a gargantuan, jet-plane-like VROOOOOOAW in the middle of a song it's pretty neat, but the fifteenth time it starts to seem like a one trick pony. I dismissed this effect entirely until I heard someone use it to cover the intro to Van Halen's &#34;Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do&#34; - all my life, I hadn't realized that the cool bite that riff has comes mostly from a very slow background flange.<br /><br />Despite its pocket-sized, two knob layout, the MXR Micro Flanger is able to get both of these sounds. With a higher Rate and Regen setting, you get what I think of as the typical, over-the-top flanger noise, but the subtle chunky sound I had in mind is achieved with the lowest possible Rate and a medium Regen setting. Dialed in this way, the flange doesn't so much &#34;whoosh&#34; your entire sound, but creates a sweeping filter effect that gives palm mutes and pick strokes a noticeable bite. Also, with a low Regen and a slightly higher Rate, you can almost simulate a Nirvana-like clean chorus sound, as well. It's not exactly the same as a chorus (they are different effects) but if you forgot a chorus pedal at home it'll get the job done.<br /><br />MXR as a brand has a sizable corner of the flanger market locked down, being a classic analog pedal company used by flange popularizer Eddie Van Halen himself. If you want that sort of sound but don't need the giant, many-knobbed version he uses, this Micro one is the perfect way to go.
