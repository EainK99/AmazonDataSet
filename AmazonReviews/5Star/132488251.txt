The flute is high quality and easy to learn - especially if you are already a musician. It gives a person who is new to the Native American flute a sense of what is required to obtain those wonderful sounds from familiar songs. I happen to have a collection of Sun Dance songs and have already played several of them on this flute. I realize that I need a lower octave on some of them but was still able play them on the scale a bit higher than the normal scale. This is worth the money and is very well crafted.<br /><br />Mike Hopkins
