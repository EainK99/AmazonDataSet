I bought two of these for my guitars, and it's obviously very important that they don't fall. They included long screws as well as drywall screws (I think that's what the package called them) in case I couldn't find a stud on the wall. I didn't end up needing the drywall screws, but the long screws held fine and secure the holder against the wall well. They don't budge and thus far (a few days), they are keeping my guitars safe and out of the way.
