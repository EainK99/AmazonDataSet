I really love this thing!  For less than the cost of a DAT machine, you have a self-contained unit that records 8 tracks at one time, mixes and masters, brilliantly, to a 25 cent CD or straight to your computer.  You really can't beat it for $500 bucks.  If you're expecting high-budget, studio quality results, you will probably be disappointed, and there is most definitely a learning curve with this, as there is with any home recording setup.  If you're expectations are more along the line to produce extremely high quality home/demo recordings, you will be pleased as punch:)<br /><br />I would recommend spending the extra $40 on the video tutorial and be prepared to spend a whole lot more on microphones, cables, direct boxes, etc., if you're going to plunged into this hobby.  If you're interested in purchasing this, it's probably because you want to be able to record 8 tracks at once.  I can tell you that it does what it's meant to do.  Make sure that you purchase the 32 gig card if you're going to use it this way, as the included 2 GB card will run out very quickly.  You are also going to need a decent pair of Reference Monitors, if you want to use this to mix and master CDs or MP3s.  Also, this is not a 24 track recorder, but more accurately an 18 track recorder.  The stereo tracks do come in handy for using stereo mics and doubling applications, but it's only 18 individual tracks that can be mixed at one time.<br /><br />After watching the video a couple of times and making a few test recordings, I was pretty much off and running with this thing.  I have not experienced any incidents of crashes or freezes, and I have pushed my DP-24 to its absolute limit.  I would pass on the DP-32, as it only gives you 2 additional tracks for an extra $200.  Put that money into some mixing speakers or a new condenser mic. and go with the 24!
