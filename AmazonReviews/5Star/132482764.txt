This bag is made of really durable material. It can hold incredible weight and sharp tools will not make the holes. I am using for caring my Paintless Dent Repair (PDR)tools which some of them are sharp. It has three pockets, hard material bottom bottom and high study under bottom rails. Two handles in the back to lift the bag two handles in the sides and one shoulder strap.<br />It is heavy little so I am planning to change flooring material to aluminium.<br />i am 100% satisfied with the product.
