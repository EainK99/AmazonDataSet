Very lightweight like a Fender &#34;Thin&#34; yet solid with a mild amount of give. If you drop one onto a table or floor it suprisingly sounds like glass or ceramic. Which is very different from what it feels like. Of course that has nothing to do with how it performs but was interesting to me. I<br /><br />I found out about these from a Epiphone Les Paul I got, one was packaged as a tie-in I suppose. I accidentally dropped it 3 stories down a parking garage. Thought it was lost but found it a month later.<br /><br />I prefer to use these over anything else now. I had looked for them at a few local Guitar Centers but none had even heard of this brand. One salesman suggested a Dunlop version which unfortunately was a far cry from this.
