I am a Boss effects pedal devotee, and , after growing tired of paying good money to buy 9 volt batteries all the time, I decided to invest in 3 of these power packs. Smart move...no more power failures in the middle of a gig.These puppies work perfectly in my pedals, and I paid nowhere near what I wouldv'e paid had I gotten the ones made by the pedal manufacturer. I'll be getting a couple more of these pretty soon for back-up...at this price,you can afford it!
