A great bass! This is my first 5 string and I am well pleased. The 4-string bass it is replacing is also a Jackson. The old one was the bottom-line model. Although I am partial to Jackson I was not anticipating getting one this time around, but then I came across this, in my price range, and was VERY pleased! The two double-coil EMG's give me lots of volume compared to my old bass.<br /><br />The knobs are volume, a balance control for the pickups, and a built in 3 way equalizer. The EQ actually makes a big difference, too. The guitar sounds great even with flat EQ, but it's nice to know I have that extra there if I need some more low end (or high, or mid) and don't have a chance to tweak my effects.<br /><br />The fact that it is Dave Ellefson signature is a nice touch, since I am an old Megadeth fan. Don't let this fact be a dealbreaker if you aren't a fan. The signature is on the bezel- the small piece of plastic that covers the truss rod, on the head stock. If it bothers you it is possible to flip it around, so that it is plain black.<br /><br />I play a variety of music types, from metal to contemporary Christian worship music with a little slap mixed in, and so far this bass has shined at everything I have done with it!<br /><br />By the way, I now know why the EQ is so good, having read the description here. It's active. There was nothing to give me a clue that this was the case when I purchased it locally! I thought the description had a mistake until I took the screws out of the back to check, and sure enough, there is a 9-volt battery shut up in there.
