I picked up this audio interface because it not only will record with your computer, but it will also record directly to the iPad.  This is a simple interface which I prefer and it works well in letting YOU shine through.  The build quality is quite nice and I love the direct input for the iPad.  You can use it on the go as it is small and get stuff recorded as it comes to you.  Overall all, a brilliant package for a brilliant price.
