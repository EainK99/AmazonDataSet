If you are looking for an explorer type guitar seriously check this one out. I ordered this instrument to add to my collection of Flying V,LP,335,PRS,Fender and, other various instruments not to mention several acoustic electics a mandolin and, a couple of fiddles. The explorer has always been in the back part of my mind as an instrument that I may someday wish to own and, this one is really a Great guitar. I wasn't sure about the all black and, not having fret markers but, I found out when I unboxed it that I was very glad that I ordered it. It has dot markers on the side of the neck that are clearly visible and, truthfully I like the look of the neck without the dots on the fretboard. It has a very cool looking XII on the 12th fret. Intonation was spot on, the only adjustments I made were to drop the action and, tweak the truss rod ever so slightly. Plugged it in to my amp checked the electronics, tuned it up and wailed for about 2hrs. Great sound and, playability clean or overdriven it sounded Great! The satin neck is fast and feels good to the touch. I did add a Dunlop strap lock to the top of the guitar where the original strap button was just because where it is located it puts a sharp bend in the strap and, the strap could possibly come off the original button, very simple install and, I think well worth the effort and money. I would recommend this guitar to anyone looking for an explorer type body guitar.
