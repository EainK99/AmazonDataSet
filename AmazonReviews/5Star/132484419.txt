We bought this for my son to practice piano when we go camping, which we do often. He is a young beginner, and we wanted it mainly for learning finger coordination and note reading skills. We didn't want every lesson after a camping trip to be a crummy one.<br /><br />I'm a professional musician, and here's the deal: This piano does what it says it will do. It works on AA batteries, rolls out on any flat surface, and plays the notes decently enough. It ain't a Steinway, but it will do the job. I looked on YouTube at videos of other brands and I think this one sounds a lot better- worth the higher price IMHO.<br /><br />We haven't hooked it up to mess around with MIDI yet, but if we do I'll come back and update this review.<br />If you need something extremely basic for the simplest of purposes, this could be a great little tool.
