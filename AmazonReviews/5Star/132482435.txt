Love this bag - worth every penny.  We bought this for our 7th grade son.  My son rides his bike to school and those big clunky instrument cases were a nightmare for him.  This bag solved that problem.  We ordered the back pack straps though.  He didn't like the strap that came with it.  If this is for a kid the backpack strap is a must.
