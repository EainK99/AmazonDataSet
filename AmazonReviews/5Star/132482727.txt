I've been a long-time user (and big fan) of Rock Prodigy since its initial IOS release. The interface guides you through all lessons, exercises, and songs at your own pace. Lessons can be repeated as often as needed, and can be slowed down or sped up as well. I often go back to earlier exercises to ensure I'm still able to play them well (or to try and beat my high scores).<br /><br />As a beginner guitarist I've taken private and online lessons, bought piles of books, watched countless YouTube videos, and purchased other apps to try and learn guitar. None have been as well organized (or enjoyable!) as Rock Prodigy. I'm seeing real results and couldn't be happier with the product.
