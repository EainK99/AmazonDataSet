This is a fun little amp for when you're just fooling around and don't need big sound.  The clean tone is ok, the overdrive isn't all that great, you can't adjust anything, but that's kinda the point... it's inexpensive and not meant to replace a full amp setup.  If you like to just jam sometimes without annoying everyone in the house this is for you.  The headphone jack is very handy. To get the same effect I used to have to run a cable from my guitar to a small practice amp, then plug headphones into the amp, which always ended up in a tangled mess as soon as I moved.  This is completely portable so you aren't anchored to one spot to practice. I can have a self-jam session in my office or in the backyard.  For those complaining about the sound quality... get a grip, it's a very cheap practice amp replacement and fills that role well enough.
