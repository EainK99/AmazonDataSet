first of all, this pair of headphones exhibits details i have not previously heard from any others in this price range. i'm sure that there are other opinions on this, but my opinion of these is based on my experience with headphones i have had in the past and these just blow the others away. if they don't extract the details from whatever media is being used, what good are they? i expect very much more from higher end headphones than how loud they can play. soundstaging, the size of the room being recorded in and the precision of blending in the recording of all the instruments is very important. these headphones yield these attributes with astonishing ease. for a dynamic type headphone in this price point, they are superior to others. headphone listeners can be a very opinionated bunch. they want different things from there headphones,but they all want to enjoy the music they listen to. these headphones deliver that enjoyment to me and do so with ease and grace. they're comfortable to your head without the pinching effects of some cheaper and less well thought out designs. your opinion may vary from mine and that's okay, but i'm very satisfied with these guys and sennheiser has a winner here.
