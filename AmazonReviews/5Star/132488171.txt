I am a lead jazz trumpet player, and for a while I stayed on a Shilke 14A4A. When I didn't get the results I wanted, I decided to make a switch. I tried out a dozen or so different mp's, but they were either too shallow, didn't have the bite/overblown, or didn't fit my embouchure the way I wanted. This one however hit that sweet spot. As always, sample before buying a mp.
