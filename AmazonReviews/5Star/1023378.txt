I recently ordered this for my clarinet playing granddaughter, who enters high school this year and needed a better instrument. I, myself, played clarinet both in concert and marching band throughout my school years, so I recognize a quality instrument when I see and hear it. I am extremely pleased with the quality of both the workmanship and the sound of this instrument. The soft case is really nice, also, and it has a zip pouch on the front for extra reeds, etc. It exceeded my expectations, and my granddaughter is thrilled to have an instrument of which she can be proud. Excellent price for this instrument!
