These are excellent acoustic guitar strings that have a more clean, brassy sound to them. Overall great sounding strings and I have no complaints!<br /><br />***If you are new to buying guitar strings for your guitar I HIGHLY recommend you search around and discover what sound you are looking for before you buy. Guitar strings are NOT all the same and it is important you know this! Also you should be changing your guitar strings every several months (depending on how often you play as well as other factors) so if you haven't changed them in a long time it's a cheap, easy fix while the reward of refreshed sound is absolutely gratifying!
