i used this acoustic foam to refurbish my existing speakers which I had made some 5 years ago (ported bass reflex with 10\\" woofers). I had originally used upholstery foam for lining the insides. After replacing with this foam, there is a marked difference in the sound. The bass is much deeper and clean now and I can really feel the true effect of the 10\\" woofers. The best thing about this product is that it does not eat into the volume of air too much owing to its small thickness. On the whole, a worthwhile purchase. i would certainly recommend this product to others. Go for it!!!
