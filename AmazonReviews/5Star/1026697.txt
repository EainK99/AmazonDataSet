I dont write product reviews very often; but when I find something worth talking about that is something else again.<br />I do write reviews for outstanding products that need to be recognized for what they are.<br /><br />THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING PRODUCT !!<br /><br />I admit to being very picky about tools.<br />I spent 30+ years repairing precision equipment for a living, and that requires very high quality precise tools.<br />You cant do quality work without quality tools and that includes gauges required to set things ACCURATELY.<br /><br />You either do the job right, or you do it wrong.<br />There is NO middle ground.<br /><br />Cheap tools = poor quality, performance & lousy results.<br /><br />You get what you pay for IF your careful what you buy.<br />The internet is loaded with low quality crap that you will pay good money for;<br />but you wont find out you were had until you get some stamped trash from asia in the mail.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line:<br />You need a high quality precision gauge to do an accurate setup, nobody argues that point.<br />THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING TOOL for that purpose !!!<br /><br />Yes, there are more expensive gauges on the market; but that does NOT make them better, just more $$$$<br /><br />Of course, you can buy one or more of the cheap stamped pieces of junk for less money.<br />After they break you can give in & buy one of these; but why go through the hassle & waste your money too??<br /><br />Hey, If you don't feel you deserve the best tools you can get, asia will love you.
