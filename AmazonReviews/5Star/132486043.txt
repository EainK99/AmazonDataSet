I read a lot of reviews for this product that said they received it broken. This really scared me, but I decided to give it a try anyways, because I was throwing a black light party and needed more lights. I bought three of these and they all got to me in perfect condition, and were packaged very well. Maybe the company has changed it's packaging system.<br /><br />Anyways, I got three of these for a 60x60 space, and along with 7 regular black light bulbs, lit the room pretty well. I would say that you probably need one for every 10 square feet of space, so it's not cheap, but they do look pretty cool when mounted on walls. Also, mount on walls at different angles for an 80's affect.<br /><br />Also, the extension cord is not 6ft long, it's more like 4 ft.
