The AMT Japanese Girl Wah is the smallest wah pedal I've ever seen or used. So right off the bat it solves one of the main issues I have with wah pedals - their size. Other things I like about it are that it has a blue LED to tell you when the wah is on, the switch is responsive and easy to engage, and the addition of a switch to specify a frequency range in with the wah operates (three ranges to choose from).<br /><br />It is rugged, very sturdy, operates off a standard 9V center negative tip adpater, and is a lovely shade of blue. It's brilliant.
