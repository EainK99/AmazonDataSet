This is exactly what I've been looking for. I typically game on my main desktop and I keep a laptop next to me to play music and other stuff. So now I don't have to alt+tab out of a game to control my music (like soundcloud and beatport, stuff not controllable through keyboard shortcuts and such). Exactly what I needed.
