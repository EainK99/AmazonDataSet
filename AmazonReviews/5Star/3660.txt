I got mine, a demo,  through Sam Ash.  I have owned an Anderson boutique Strat type guitar, an Eric Johnson model Strat, and a few lesser guitars like a Squire, etc.  I have put in some very expensive high quality pickups in those guitars.  I have also handled about 30 other guitars in an attempt to find one I like.  My complaint against Fender is that their frets, even on American models up to at least $2000, are very often, so uneven as to need dressing if you are going to get it set up even reasonable right.  Also, I have never found them to have intonation correct even after adjusting.  That said I know this is all possible because major artists use them.  Of course they have techs that work on them after every show.  The other reason I know this is all possible is because this Korean made PRS came to me in perfect working order.  With 9 gauge strings, I adjusted the relief and lowered the strings to specs and lower with absolutely no buzzing up and down the neck.  The tone is exceptional (no need to change pickups) and the sound variety due to the on demand split coil is excellent.  Fit and finish are also perfect  which is more then I can say for any Fender or Gibson I picked up and tried.  Maybe I lucked out, but I would take this over anything in the under $2500 bracket without question.  It is an exceptional value.  PRS must have a hand in amazing QC at the Korean plant.
