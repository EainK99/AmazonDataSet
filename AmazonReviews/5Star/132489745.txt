Received this item within a few days after ordering (amazon is always quick). The product is very strong and not cheaply made like other competitors. I am using this item to hold a modem, NAS, and other network equipment without using a rack. ( I turned the tray backwards and drilled it into the wall). This item is perfect for what i am using it for would recommend to anyone.
