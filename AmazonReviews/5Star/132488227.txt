I came to this recorder having experience with the Yamaha 300 series Alto recorder, which is a fairly good model. This one however beats it hands down.<br /><br />The recorder itself is slightly longer than the Yamaha and it has a slightly greater diameter. But what impressed me was the sound and the ease of playing some of the high register notes. The Yamnaha has a decent sound but this has a superior sound. I play by ear so I don't know all the note letters. But the note that is produced by closing the upper two holes on the front and closing the thumb hole halfway, requires extreme precision both in thumb placement and in breath pressure on the Yamaha. On this model, I can play it with ease.<br /><br />As an added bonus, this model comes with a thumb rest that you can position in the most comfortable, for you, place. And it being a three piece model, the foot is configurable for optimal placement of the lowermost tone hole, the exact placement of which won't be the same for everyone.<br /><br />All in all, this is a superior instrument. Some people call it a semi-professional recorder. If you are comparing it to wood, I would say a more accurate description would be a near-professional recorder. But seeing as wood is so sensitive and can only be played (without damaging the instrument), for about 40 minutes a day, which includes a 5 minute peroid of \\"blowing it in\\", I would say that this is a professional instrument, period. I would not hesitate to recommend this model for concert work as it sounds fairly close to an actual wooden model.
