This portable system has great sound in a compact package! My wife and I conduct birds of prey programs at schools, state parks, civic groups, etc. and we are very impressed with the versatility this system gives us. We not only run two wireless mics but a CD player and DVD sound. The speakers handle all we put through them with incredible reproduction with little to no distortion. We are very pleased with the Europort EPA 150 and highly recommend it to anyone wanting great sound at a great price!
