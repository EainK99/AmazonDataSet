I am no audiophile - I just love music - so I will keep this short and sweet. These headphones sound absolutely fantastic. At first, my ears felt like they might get too warm with extended use, but with about a week of breaking them in, it is not a problem. I am in the process of getting a nice stereo system for the living room, and upgrading my computer with a dedicated sound card, so this will go well with those items. in the meantime, I have just been listening to mp3s on my phone (Nokia Lumia 920).The phone does have built in Dolby and actually sounds good with regular headphones, but these headphones have transformed the sound.<br /><br />Definitely a buy - even if you aren't an audiophile like me.
