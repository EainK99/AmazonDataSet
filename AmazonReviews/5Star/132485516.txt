Excellent little leather strap holder for an acoustic. Saves you from relying on a piece of string. Impressed with the quality and it looks good too. Need to weave it under the strings just right to prevent any string dampening. It takes a bit of getting used to at first, but it really keeps your guitar steady and it seems very durable. Great purchase!
