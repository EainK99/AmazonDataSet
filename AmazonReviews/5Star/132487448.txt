I use this for streaming video game sessions and my voice is clear and the background noise is negligible (it doesn't have noise cancellation, it's just good enough that it sounds like your standing in front of me). The mount that it comes with fits on any microphone stand. Note the buttons only control the volume for the headphone jack on the mic. Also the blue led light can be bothersome but I put a piece of electrical tape over it and it doesn't even look bad. While I'm sure it's not studio worthy, this mic is perfect for anyone doing their own production and can't afford a $1000 setup. To be honest, I don't even feel like I want to upgrade. This mic is all I need.
