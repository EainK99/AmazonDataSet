excellent piece of gear!  Now a days, instead of lugging around my pedalboard that weight about 25+ pounds,2x12 amp that weight almost 55 pounds and two guitars for gigs, I just bring this,the power supply for it, and my two guitars. I just go straight into FOH mixer in stereo put some on my monitors and good to go! Before purchasing this unit,I watch a lot of youtube vids and it turns out that its really easy and intuitive to program and get useful live amp sounds and effects. Lots of possibilities, fun to use, and most of all, nails down the sounds very scary close to some of the marshall/fender amps I've own in the past and have use to gig with.<br />I highly recommend it! I also recommend that the input and output set ups be done properly depending on how its use.  I cannot stress enough<br />how really important it is to SET UP INPUT OUTPUTS CORRECTLY DEPENDING ON APPLICATIONS OR YOUR SOUND WILL SUFFER AND WILL LEAVE YOU FRUSTRATED!!! Go to line6.com and get to know the set up section well.  Since using the Line6 HD500X live! I've had about the same amount of excellent complements on my sound! in other words the audience can't tell pedals and tube amps VS line6 HD500X!!!<br />And to top it all,The sound man is happy that the stage volume is a lot more controllable.  Buy it......
