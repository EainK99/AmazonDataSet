I love this microphone for sensitivity, and clarity.<br />I am a frequent and daily user of Skype and Internet Phone calling so clarity is very important for me.<br />This excelled beyond expectations.<br /><br />What I liked about it:<br />It has a very long cord, so it can be sat in the middle of a conference table for central placement of a number of people sitting around a table.<br />It is very clear, it does not create echo, muffling and picks up voices very clearly.<br />Bonus: because it is a USB microphone, it is not connected to my laptop, and I can multitask and type whilst talking and it won't pick up key striking from keyboard.<br /><br />What I didn't like about it:<br />nothing
