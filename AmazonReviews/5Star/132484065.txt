I got this ukulele for Christmas last year and I absolutely loved it. The design is really pretty and gorgeous. I play it almost everyday and it's good quality and it'll be worth your money. When compared to my friend's ukulele though, mine was a slightly lower sound and pitch than hers. I'm not complaining but if you want more of a higher pitch sound, go with something else. But the sound difference isn't that noticeable. It fits perfectly in the concert bag and overall it was a good purchase for me. I didn't find any problems with it at all.
