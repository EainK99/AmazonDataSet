So I just got a pair of the DXR8s and obviously want to protect them. These are basically your only option for something that was designed for this product. These cases are a little pricey, but I have no doubt they will last as long as the speaker does. Very heavy duty canvas and zippers, and the design is nice to. The pocket on the side is big enough for quite a few cables. I have a power strip, speaker power cable and an XLR cable in one pocket, so it takes away from clutter elsewhere. It also comes with a nice strap for over your shoulder. Overall, these are worth the investment to protect your DXR speakers. The DXRs come with a 7-year warranty, and I think this bag will help to ensure that I get to see the seven years.
