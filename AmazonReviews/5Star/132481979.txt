I have used Elixir strings on my Taylor guitars for years and find them to be durable while bringing out the best resonance from my guitars.  Having a 12 string requires more effort and time in changing strings.  I would rather be playing than cranking tuners.  Elixirs allow me to do just that.  Highly recommended!
