The sound blows every &#34;portable&#34; I've tried in head-to-head competition which were:  the Bose Soundlink 3, Soundlink Mini II, Big Jambox, Sony X55, Roar 2, Amazon Echo, Sonos Play One (great sounding).  This doesn't have a battery but if you want the battery and similar size and sound to this one, look at the Marshall Kilburn.  What I like about the unit is that you can tweak the bass and treble to suit taste.  The unit goes loud enough to get phone calls from the neighbors.  The build quality and classic design is also top notch.  The bluetooth works perfectly with my Android LG G3 smartphone and Ipad Air.  Not one singular issue.  The BT is also APT-X capable for higher fidelity sound when paired to APT-X equipped devices like my G3.  The only thing I'll mention is that when you hook up to the AUX cable, you can hear the amp hiss.  I have SUPER top % hearing so I'm unrealistically picky about this type of stuff.  My wife or most any other won't notice or be bothered with such matters, but I do.  I rather prefer to stream through bluetooth instead, as the noise is gone/not apparent.  I also have to mention that I unfortuantely have an UNGROUNDED power outlet so this is probably the issue. Regardless, I use bluetooth anyways as I like to stream my Netflix &#34;cable free&#34; from across the bedroom on my Ipad.  Bluetooth is also well implemented as the delay in voices isn't egregious as it is when streaming bluetooth Netflix on Ipad as on other portables (the worst offender being the Sony X55...wow were voices laggy on that Sony unit!).  There really isn't too much that can be said other than I tried the best-of-the-best, most highly rated portable units in head-to-head competition and the Acton blew the doors out of all of the them.  The Sonos Play One also distinguished itself in the sound category (though still the lesser of the two), but it's indeed a smaller beast and only does Wifi, not bluetooth.......The Marshall is the only one that actually had &#34;good&#34; sound in the portable form factor.  The rest of the portables (minus Sonos) are muddled sounding &#34;TOYS&#34; (though the Amazon Echo is a toy worth keeping for other reasons).  On a side note, I went for a beefier sounding smaller-midsized bluetooth/airplay **STEREO** system setup for the bedroom in the Kanto Yu3....a ridiculously good sounding system!  You can read my Amazon review.  This Kanto system is more ambitious (less portable) but priced similarly to some of the stuff here and truly worthy of your consideration if you're open to such a system for your application/usage.  I'm STILL keeping the Marshall Acton, as this unit is truly a &#34;portable&#34; and worthy for keeping on the deck, bedroom(s), kitchen, etc.  Really good sound where you don't feel compromised in something &#34;toyish sounding&#34; like the top rated portable units above.  The Acton is in another league.  Period!
