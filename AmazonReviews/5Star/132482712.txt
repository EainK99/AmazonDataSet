I have now purchased 3 of these LED strip lights.  You do need some sort of transformer which can also be found on Amazon, but you can hook these up and add a dimmer (also from Amazon) and have the whole thing done for about $30.  I have used them both under cabinet and above cabinet lighting.  This style does have the bluish tent to the light, but my wife loves blue, so it was a win win!  If you want a whiter (traditional incandescent look) find ones that are in the 2800 range of color (research a little).<br />I should add photos sometime!  Maybe soon?<br />Only problem I had was in addition to using the tape to secure under the cabinet, I used a stapler with a heavy duty U staple.  One time the force of the stapling must have broken the electrical connection and a section lost power.  So be careful using too much force if you staple reinforce the light strip.  Also cutting and hooking up space between strips is a little tricky.  I used both the clip style but was more successful in actually using a very small amount of solder to hook and extension to get from one lighted area to another.  On this water proof style, you will need to peel back that protective cover to make the electrical connection.
