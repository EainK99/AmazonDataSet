Where to start with this one. First off, it is stunningly beautiful. Oil finished and polished to a nice glow. The match maple grain on the back of the instrument is stunning. The best thing about it....the tone. Big, thick and rich. Not boxy or thin. This Violin sounds better than instruments that cost over double it's very fair price. All the woods are quality..spruce ebony and maple. Very well constructed. It was ready to play right out of the case. A beautiful instrument that is more than worthy of it's price. Wow.
