Recently I decided to become more mysterious, and found that being surrounded by fog is the perfect way. I cannot explain the number of ways Froggy's Fog has improved my life. There is nothing more exciting than appearing at the office picnic completely enveloped by mist.  It really demonstrated to my boss the kind of man he may have hired, and my coworkers now consider me a man of myth. Simple tasks around the house will become a sight to behold.  You will love the way your wife looks at you when you come in the house on a hot summer day, arms filled with fresh picked garden veggies, surrounded by a mixed haze of water vapor and man sweat. I have no doubt that a fog machine and  this formula was the way to go for me.<br /><br />I will issue a warning that Froggy's Fog is not a cheap run the mill product. This is the real stuff folks. So you are going to want a top notch self nebula maker. I would suggest at the minimum 500w machine. I personally like [[ASIN:B000B6DTY2 American Dj Fog Storm 1200 Hd Fog Machine]] powered by converted model plane engine.  This buddy will hide you like smog in a London fog.  If you are going to get an inexpensive model then I suggest either going for [[ASIN:B005UQPPK4 1 Gallon (128 Oz.) Great Party & DJ Fog Juice for Water Based Fog Machines - American Made - Perfect Fog Fluid for Small 400 Watt to Higher Wattage 1500 Watt Foggers]] also made by Froggy's which is designed for lower wattage. You can also simply dilute this product by 1/3.<br /><br />  Summing up I cannot say enough about well this item works. If you are a Bagpiper, Dock Worker, or Arch Nemesis in training then this is the product for you. If you love to make amazing first impressions this product is for you. If you need an awesome avatar pic on dating sites this product is for you. If you need the perfect way to exit the hatchback of '93 Civic This product is for you. Absolute 5 Stars
