I bought an AES cable for a particular proprietary use.  I connect my line6 HD500 guitar pedal board to my line6 DT25 amplifier.  After waiting for my next gig, I found there is an extremely loud hiss on the distortion channels using this cable that doesn't exist when I use a standard &#34;non AES&#34; mic cable.  I contacted 2 certified line6 service centers and they both said they are sure it's either the HD500 or DT25, not the cable.  At 32 days after purchase I got on amazon web site and discovered that I had 30 days to return the product.  I guess I'm stuck with it now.  5 stars for what I'm sure is a quality product.  1 star for amazon return policy.
