I've been an active musician for the past 13 years, and I played many guitars strung with many varieties of guitar strings. I've always played mostly blues, classic rock, and my own songs which vary from folky strumming to Black Label Society riffage. Not only do I use the acoustic string sets, but I also use the electric sets as well. For the longest time, I used Elixir or Martin ones for acoustic, and Dean Markley BLUE STEEL, Ernie Ball Slinkys, or GHS Boomers for electric... I have to say that these Dunlop strings are great on my expensive Ovation or my cheap Fender Rogue guitar. The tone is well balanced and the strings can also hold their tune better as well. They sound relatively new all the way until you put a fresh set on... I'm Happy with them and you will be too... So pick up a set and experience clarity!
