There is not enough good to say about these amazing headphones. I have used many different models from many different manufacturers over the years, and the 7506 are the classic, good sounding, accurate, comfortable, well made, inexpensive cans you have been looking for.<br /><br />They are closed back headphones, which means they eliminate some of the background noise and help you hear more clearly the sound you are listening too. This is a two edged sword, because while you can focus and hear your music/game/movie more clearly, you won't be able to hear other people talking to you in the room. This is a good thing and a bad thing... :)<br /><br />I have had a few pairs of these headphones over the years, and I have never had a bad experience with them, or had them go bad. The only reason I replaced them, was because they were stolen (I WILL AVENGE YOU HEADPHONES!!!) or destroyed (run over by a semi truck) and everything sounds very good through them.<br /><br />They are not the flashiest headphones, but if you are serious about sound, these will not disappoint.
