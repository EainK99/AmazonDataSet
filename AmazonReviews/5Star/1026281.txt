I started playing with a full set of Innovation wound nylons which tore up my fingers pretty bad after a while and didn't quite have the action I was looking for. Swapped to these when my bridge broke and it's like night and day. They're way easier on the fingers, have great action for playing slap, and don't put as much stress on my bridge. And let's be honest-- the value is crazy good.<br /><br />My only beef is that they go out of tune at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />Update: After a month or so, I've realized it's just the humidity. These are great overall. Changing to 5 stars.
