The dynamic kicker mic pumps out such a great, tight, and accurate sound. I tried it out on the kick drum of course, but it really surprised me on testing it on a bass amp. Both results were simply spectacular. The pencil condenser mic I tested out on an acoustic guitar, guitar amp, and snare. Once again, great clear results. People often sleep on MXL mics, but I've never had a bad experience trying them out. Get these, and use them on a number of different sources. That's all there is to it.
