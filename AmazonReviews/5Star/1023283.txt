Our music teacher was wowed by this one, and she play's in a band.  This has 2 cable outlets to amp. Has B band tuner built in. you can change the cable outlet to go to a computer with USB port for recording your play. You will need the USB upgrade to do that though.  The Moonflower has a real nice sound to it right out of the box & with the acoustic amp from Luna it has chorus and a jack for a microphone.  This is a real nice unit for the price.  Teacher thought it was going to be 1200.00 or more when she first saw it.
