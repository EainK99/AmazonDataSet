I waited until I had put this through it's paces to give a review.<br /><br />This is definitely a professional-grade EQ - you are not going to plug it into the stereo you bought at the local Target without some serious research into converting pro connectors to consumer connectors. With that said, when fed from the right quality of source and with a good amp after it, you can fine-tune to account for any environment.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Rack-mount<br />XLR and TRS connections<br />Clear indicators for at-a-glance reference<br />discrete subwoofer output with adjustable cutout<br /><br />Cons:<br />Inside heat sink should have been vented to outside air - it gets very hot in some configurations<br /><br />This is worth it if you have the setup to match it's capabilities; if all you have is RCA jacks, plan on some work to get it going, and do not skimp on the cables.
