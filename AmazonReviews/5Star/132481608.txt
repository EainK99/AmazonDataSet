fantastic bag lots of great pockets decent padding for the guitar just took it over to Ireland everything worked pretty good once Matt strap broke but that was my fault because I was way too much weight on it for me to grab a bite that great bag for the price definitely recommended for a soft padded gig bag with this protection pocket space
