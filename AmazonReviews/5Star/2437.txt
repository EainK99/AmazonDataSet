Clarinet and saxophone player here, having played (school band and since then, for fun) for a few decades. I was not overly familiar with this brand, having used Rico, Vandoren and others over the years. I must say, I am impressed. They are indeed strong yet easy to use. Good tonal quality, very firm and not shaky. A good reed can elevate your playing, and this is a good reed. I will be buying more of these.
