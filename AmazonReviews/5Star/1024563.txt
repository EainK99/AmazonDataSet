I have had these earphones for about a year now and can say that they will last a very long time if you use the included carrying case (which is nice). The sound isolation on these are very good, and the sound is very clear. However, if you are used to and love bass heavy headphones I would not recommend these as they do not produce the lower frequencies with as much power.
