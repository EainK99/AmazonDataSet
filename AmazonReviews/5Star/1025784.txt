This is a comparative review of Samuel Kolstein's Bass rosin vs Pop's Bass Rosin. Both are very good but this is why I prefer Kolstein's.<br /><br />While Pop's is great and one of the standard rosin brands for Double Bassists, I have always preferred Kolstein's brand (and not because I owned a bass and bow from the luthier Sam Kolstein for years- comparatively, it just surpasses Pop's performance). Pop's is just too soft and with Kolstein it is just the right consistency to give you a good grip without being too sticky, runny etc especially in warm weather. It also does not get too hard or have a tendency to crack in colder weather as Pop's does. You can tell by the sound when someone has too much rosin on their bow and with Kolstein, even if you use a little more than you need it won't &#34;glob&#34; up on your bow hair and create that kind of &#34;gravely&#34; sound behind the note when there's too much. It gives you an excellent grip but still allows the bow hair to have a natural feel and sound on the string (also a little secret is that I always carry a toothbrush and brush off any excess rosin and separate the hairs).  Pop's is so soft that with more inexperienced players, they can easily use far too much rosin and suffer from too much rosin build up on the bow hair which affects sound negatively.<br /><br />You can see from the posted images that there is a much smaller quantity of the Kolstein brand than the Pop's. Why? Contrary to belief you really don't need much rosin at all if you have quality bow hair- (if you go with &#34;AAA&#34; level Moroccan horse hair in either salt and pepper or black, you really need very little rosin- if you use this same quality but in white, you just need a bit more on it than you'd use for the salt-pepper and black because the hair is naturally not as course. Ask your bow repairer/ luthier for this type of hair and you will hear a major difference in the bow sound before you even use any rosin. NEVER use synthetic bow hair. Synthetic hair combined with rosin equals bad tone.<br /><br />Also the actual Kolstein rosin itself comes encapsulated inside a rubber sleeve (see images) that maintains the structure of the rosin itself within the outer gold cardboard casing and won't allow the rosin to stick to the sides in any weather. All I do is roll down the rubber just enough to draw the bow across it a couple times, let the rubber go and it keeps everything nicely in its place. This is an upgrade from back in the day when it was encased in a cardboard casing you had to peel off.<br /><br />As you can see from the Pop's rosin (given to me to use from an instrument rental shop with a piece of the paper cup torn off ---huge mistake!). The rosin melts out of the cup often and once it gets out of its paper cup holder it sticks to the plastic cup. When it is not melting, it's generally cracking.<br /><br />I suggest getting Kolstein's All-Weather grade (this is the ultra which works too) and you will be covered for well over a year by using sparingly on good bow hair.
