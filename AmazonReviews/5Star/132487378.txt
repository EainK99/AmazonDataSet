First of all, I love the solid feel, texture and overall appearance of this case.  The frame feels solid, there is excess padding inside.  This padding, while apparently there to provide extra protection, also makes a very uncomfortably tight fit for most dreadnaghts.  I purchased it with my new Teton STSD205NT dreadnaught in mind, but after pressing on the guitar extremely hard to get it in place, I felt uncomfortable leaving this beautiful guitar cramped in this case.  I wound up putting a lawsuit era made in Japan Gibson acoustic copy in this case.  It fit exremely tight as well, but seemed to involve a little less violent effort vs. the Teton.  My Teton is now comfortably resting in a Musicians Gear case from Musicians Friend where it can breathe.  Interestingly, this case is distributed by Chesbro, the company behind Teton.  It is recommended for all guitars in the Teton line up except for the STS205NT which, strangely, is the pinnacle of their line.  I'm still giving the case 5 stars as it is great in appearance and the overall solid frame and integrity of construction are exceptional.  It's a pity - an extra quarter inch all the way around side to side and top to bottom might have done the trick.
