It works well.<br /> Amazingly loud and doesn't eat batteries. Between the EQ and special effects buttons you can generate many different tones to match your guitars. It is a little awkward on a Lp and I could see if your not carefull it getting broken. I use mine on a Charvel Star and it sits perfectly. It is also great on a SG with P 90s.<br />Normally I turn the gain and volume up about a third of the way up and that gives me all the distortion I like.<br />It also says on the back &#34;made in japan&#34; You don't see that much anymore.<br />Cool little toy for 40 bucks and I am sure my neighbors like it too!
