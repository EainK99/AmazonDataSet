I'm using these phones for monitoring and mixing (double-checking by speakers, too).  They are a joy to listen to and seem very accurate frequency-wise.  They seal out ambient noises very well, are quite comfortable, and at moderate levels do not cause fatigue.  I highly recommend them for anyone wanting serious audio quality.
