First off, this will not be more than marginally playable out of the box. You will need to replace the tuners, nut, and bridge, as well as oil the bridge and fret board, and level and re-crown the frets, and adjust the truss-rod.And, as with any guitar, you'll want to want to put your own brand and gauge of stings on. If you aren't willing to pay for this, or can't do it yourself, you will not be happy with this guitar. All of the bad reviews either got a lemon, which is possible with low-price mass produced Chinese goods, or just are not entirely knowledgeable about guitars and guitar set-up or repair. First thing to do when you buy this, is throw out the included items, gig bag, extra string, the crappy strap and picks, maybe keep the tuner, it works, not well, but it works. Once you do the affore-mentioned upgrades and set-up, you'll have a pretty well playing guitar. I do not recommend this if you want to play in an acoustic setting, this isn't great tone wood, but slap a pickup system, or a sound hole pickup ( I use a simple eBay single-coil system,) and this is a great guitar for playing out. I'm a working musician, and normally play a re-issue Harmony Sovereign with Fishman electronics, and a Taylor GS Mini with the GS Mini pickup, and once set-up this Crescent isn't half bad at all. I really like playing this, it's light and I don't worry about it getting beat up in the Jeep on the way to gigs, or falling off the stand, or kids playing with it at the house. For the price, and maybe $30-50 dollars worth of parts and a decent gig bag, I really don't think you can beat this deal.
