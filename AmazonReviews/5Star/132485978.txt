This ukulele from Mahalo, and all the painted ones are well built, sound great, and are very affordable! At this price, it's easy to buy many and give them away with a lesson or two. The tuners stay put, the strings are fine, if they're not the thin black ones, and with some stretching on the player's part, will stay in tune.<br /> If the tuners slip, tighten up the screw on the back a bit. The strings WILL stretch and go flat, but only in the beginning. Knowing that, you can stretch them yourself, and re-tune the first few times you play.<br /> I can't say enough good things about these Mahalo ukuleles. Portable, pretty, tough enough to fall, and tolerable, to some degree, to temperature and humidity changes. More so than more expensive ukuleles, so these models can do it all!
