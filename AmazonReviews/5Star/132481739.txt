I've been playing guitar for a good few years and I have to say that this one is really well built. I had no problems out of the box and it was setup really well. I love that it has the floating bridge but a mustang style body. The paint job is also flawless! It holds tune very well. The only thing i'd recommend is changing the stock strings, they are name brand but they just don't feel good to me. They may to you, so it's really just a matter of preference.
