You gotta get this guitar !!!<br /><br />First...go under the picture at the top and look at my pictures I sent. I was really excited to receive this and started taking pics. I take pride in the decisions I make and yea I hope for the best. Some of the reviews are sorta scary...but she came through perfect. I also ordered strings I favor and yea these made a difference. Not that the strings on it were bad. Stretched em out a little and re-tuned til stable. They sounded \\"good\\" but yea up scale strings feel so much better on my fingers. I have construction hands...relatively larger fingers than most I see play on YouTube. Wasn't sure how this guitar would do. Nice, playable just like my LP. No urethane on the back of the neck, nice an satiny feel to it. It is a real joy to play.<br /><br />Everything that needed to be loose for shipping was, the neck was tight fitting and stable though. The sealed tuners are really NICE! once I adjusted all the small screws on the ends they felt snug and stable, I worried about that when I first started to tune up but now real smooth. Sited the neck...perfect. Slight in bow at 7th  so some one took the time for that. Intonation good but all that changed when I put medium strings on. The tremolo was tight to the body, now floats nice after adjustments to the screws. And yea I just got it but what I was reading about tuning issues...they just didn't happen. I'm gentle on the tremolo but I know it will take awhile for the strings to break in.<br /><br />Actually the pup's aren't that bad, good enough I'll stick with em while I investigate replacements. Another adjustment to consider before putting down these as weak. Height adjustments need to be accounted for at the bridge. Not too much, but raising the pups afterwards enhances the output so give this beauty the once over. The 5 position switch, volume, tone controls are very precise.<br /><br />This purchase has shown me that some times price doesn't \\"always\\" reflect quality. This is not a \\"CHEAP\\" guitar...yes inexpensive but by no way cheap.The wood grain and finish are awesome. I have one other electric guitar which is a Les Paul to compare with and other that the pup's being Pro Buckers which significantly added to the cost and having different sound I wanted a Strat sound with single coils and the alder wood sound way different to the mahogany body of my Les Paul. This is my player for awhile and put her through the paces.<br /><br />KUDOS to the \\"The Instrument Store\\", gotta give credit where its due, thanks for allowing those who other wise not able to afford a guitar that are made of great tone woods..Alder,rosewood and a great build. You allow incentive to want to play and learn with quality affordable instruments. Thank you Thank you...<br /><br />Lotta hype with Brand names keeps Legacy available for the \\"smart\\" budget conscience. Future upgrades to consider would be the nut & saddles to Tusq both extremely easy to do, and a pick guard for contrast. Honestly the tuners appear rock solid so far but if not going for black Sperzel lok tuners. Dunno..down the line possible Lace Sensor-red,silver,blue pups that's way down on my list tho, honest these pups aren't that bad. Honestly you need a decent amp to work with...really.<br /><br />OK- DONE. Choice is yours....<br /><br />>>UP DATE&lt;&lt; I Up graded. I'll be short this review was way longer than I wanted...lol. Mighty Mite (MM405TS), Sperzel 6 in-line locking tuners(blk),Graphtec tusq nut (5010-00) in blk. UNBELIEVABLE !!!! $125 in upgrades, got it all at Amazon. Very easy to do all these mods. Take your time sanding the nut to fit it perfect. Direct replacement with the tuners, drilled 5/64 holes for alignment pins. Soldered 2 wires for the loaded pick guard. I got the sound and look I wanted and for $225. I added another pic of my guitar finished in photos at the top.ot a \\"CHEAP\\" guitar...yes inexpensive but by no way cheap.The wood grain and finish are awesome.
