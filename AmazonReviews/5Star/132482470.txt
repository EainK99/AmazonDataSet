Have the smaller ones, great price.  I brought enough so they can stay at the church and my children will still have one every time. Good for the adults too but not for the hard beater.  Good thing bout tambs is that they can still make a joyful noise even without the middle in place!  Glory be to God for giving man the mind to make such a great instrument!
