I think this case is great. It’s modern-looking and it’s really light, which makes it easier to carry. Some violin cases I’ve had looked kind of dorky but this one is fine and it’s not as bulky as some that I’ve had. It has good padding to protect your instrument and it seems to be pretty high quality. Recommended.
