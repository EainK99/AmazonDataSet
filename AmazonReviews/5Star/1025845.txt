I'm not a professional musician by any means, but this little device has enabled me to create 8-beat loops of music that I would never be able to do otherwise!  It's only a hobby for me to create the loops, but I have a friend who has a professional music software package on his computer and is able to expand on the loops I give to him.  The only real complaint I have with it is it's not user friendly to get to the loops you created or delete the ones you want to eliminate.  Twice already in the month I have had this device, I deleted 2 loops and have no idea how I did and will never get them back. It takes some time to get used to it, but it's a ton of fun to mess around with!  I would highly recommend this to someone who wants to make music, without investing a ton of money into other products that may or may not work for them.  It's a great starter to see if you have the potential to create music and go from there.
