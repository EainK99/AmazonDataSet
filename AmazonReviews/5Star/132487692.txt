I've been a user of Berhinger signal processing products from the first three units that were imported here to the US from Germany. Back in those days the unit prices were higher and they even had service centers. Many years later...nearly all their units are inexpensive, yet still work wonderfully in my professional opinion. This is a very fine line mixer that is very clean, clear signal processing and offers stereo in outs per channel, individual volumes, even an FX send separate signal path. All 1/4&#34; inputs are balanced TRS and one pair each outputs in TRS and XLR balanced. I highly recommend nearly every product produced by Berhinger.
