The sound coming from these strings is wonderful!  It is bright without being cheap sounding, and full!  I put these on about 2 weeks ago and have only had to tune them once or twice since, and I play everyday, sometimes for hours at a time.  Love the response I get from these. And the price!  Can't beat the price!  I used to always purchase silver wound gut, for a small fortune, but can't afford them anymore.  Was looking for an alternative, and remembered reading that Celtic fiddler, Kevin Burke, had used these strings, so I decided to try them.  Happy, happy, happy!<br /><br />Nov. 11,2013...I still love the sound of these strings, but find that the A is coming unwound after about 110 hours of play time.  My nails are not long (I'm a biter) so they are not stressing the strings, but I do find that I have black fingertips after playing, leading me to believe it is a chemical reaction.  The strings are unwinding at the D note first position on the A string. Must be a popular note!  :-)  Also, these strings are loud, so be sure you have confidence and good intonation!
