This double kick is exactly what I needed! They can repeatedly stand up to abuse and not have any issues.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Repeated use with no signs of wear<br />Bigger sound with less effort than a full circular beater.<br />Smooth movement and effortless kick flourishes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The drive chains are on the small side and may someday need to be replaced.<br />The constant war between my snare stand and the left pedal.<br />A bit tough to work right out of the box, but breaks in quite nicely.<br /><br />Overall this one's a great buy and I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to get into multi-kick.
