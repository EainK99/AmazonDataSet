My teens enjoy playing for others and this will make it easier for them to play patriotic tunes as a trio.  In the past, they've used band arrangements meant for a full school band.  That left many songs without the melody line when using a snare drum, tenor sax and clarinet.  The skill level is at 5th or 6th grade which makes it easy to sight read and have fun with the songs right away.
