All the positive reviews are true. I got my V55 delivered yesterday and played it all afternoon. The tone and response is as clean as any Fender or Mesa Boogie I've ever played on.<br /><br />The high gain channel is a little raunchy for me. But that's usually the case in my opinion. I wasn't expecting much from that..<br />I bought this amp for clarity and tone. I also wanted the triode/pentode switch for recording and practicing experimentation..<br /><br />So far, the Triode switch causes it to sound a little starved. But maybe a little tweaking of the volume and master would fill it out..<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this amp. I'll be ordering the V22 next week to pair as a stereo rig. And for the option of lower wattage recording.<br /><br />And its a beautiful looking piece. The online photos don't do it justice.
