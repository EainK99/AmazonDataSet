I own snare drums with every modern, boutique throw (Trick, Nickelworks, Dunnett, etc.) and this is one of my favorites. The main reason is that this is based on the Billy Gladstone design and it really works. It releases or engages quickly and smoothly.<br /><br />When you disengage your snares by dropping the throw they are completely off the resonant head. That means the throw-off lever needs to cycle 180 degrees, and it also means that there is no buzzing from partially engaged snare wires. I also love the tension adjustment screw because the knurled head has sufficient diameter to make it easy to grasp and turn, and the thread pitch allows you to make relatively fine adjustments.<br /><br />If you are considering this as a replacement for a stock snare drum strainer the hole pattern is vertical with two holes spaced at 1.5 inches center-to-center. Note that if you are replacing a strainer that sits lower on the shell this may not work because the assembly that tensions or releases the snares has a fairly long travel range and some hoops could interfere with the travel. This is especially true for snare drums that have the thick Yamaha style hoops. Contact me in comments if you are unsure and I can provide some detailed measurements.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is probably the most overlooked design of throw-offs because it looks clunky. However, it is one of the most cost-effective and functional models on the market and one of a handful I truly trust.
