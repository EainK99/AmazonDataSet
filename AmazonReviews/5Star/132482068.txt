I got her this instead and she loved it. Best feature - headphone socket - seriously worth it's weight in gold!<br /><br />Has all different rhythm sections, change the drum sounds to different types of drums or even to some really whacky animal sounds which my daughter thought was awesome.<br /><br />Has a volume control and we're working it on batteries all the time and it's doing fine - not using too many up at all! This means it is totally portable and she can carry the drum set anywhere in the house - basement being the preferred room for me.<br /><br />It's not overly heavy, is typical Yamaha quality and will last her a long time. Other kids who come over love to play with it too - all ages, and adults too!
