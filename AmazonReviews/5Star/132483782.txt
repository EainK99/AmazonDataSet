The Texas special pickups bite! When you want a beefy solo, they full the bill. It's  no that they don't sound beautiful clean, playing chords, but it is a lead guitar at heart! In surf green, I get complimented before she comes out of the case. Then when you slip into that first soaring lead, jaws f'ing drop! I had a mid-70s strat that I was forced to sell a few years back and I always would talk about how much I miss her. This fat mama, does everything she did with lower action and a little more attitude. All in all, I can't recommend it highly enough. Amazon made it easy.
