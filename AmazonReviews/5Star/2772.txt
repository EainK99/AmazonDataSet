Value is perfect.  This has allowed me to start playing guitar for a very low cost.  Sounds great, holds a tune, finish is holding up nicely.  Overall I definitely recommend this if you want to grab a guitar and start going.<br /><br />If I had to say something was wrong with it I would say the strap is too small for a giant guy.  I am 6'2&#34; and around 240 lbs very broad.  Also, the tuner is a pitch pipe but there are a plethora of free apps out there.
