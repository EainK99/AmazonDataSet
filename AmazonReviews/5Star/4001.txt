Love them. Very lightweight, great sound quality, and I love the long cable. The only down side is that after a while they kind of hurt my ears but then again that's happened with every pair of headphones I've had so unless they're weightless, that's just an inevitable problem. Overall, wonderful headphones! Would definitely recommend!
