I wanted a resonator but even the $500. Rogues were out of my range- and the feedback about their quality is discouraging. Then I saw this Fender, with FREE 2 day shipping? Less chance for it to get damaged in shipping. It arrived in 1 1/2 days, well packed in a foam coffin. Nice action, high enough for slide, low enough for picking. No issues, no blemishes, perfect. It came with dead piano wire strings- Changed strings with new flat wounds - what a difference, what a great guitar! whether picked or played with a slide, overtones ring out and hang in the air. Very pleased.
