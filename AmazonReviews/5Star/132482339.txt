This guitar is a steal for the price.  It is beautiful and sounds like a guitar in the $5000 range.  It is very lightly built so I cannot attest to how it will stand up but it is my favorite guitar in a collection of several.  The workmanship is outstanding. It looks like a jewel on the stand.  The action was great right out of the box.  Get one before they get a reputation and the price goes sky high.  No I am not associated with the company.
