This thing is amazing. It came a day late because of my stupid post office (they're idiots). I had been saving gift cards anticipating its arrival. It's a little rough around the edges but that's easy to fix with a file or a sander and it really doesn't bother me too much.<br />Thanks for this amazing and reasonable product.
