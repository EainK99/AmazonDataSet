For anyone who might not know, Planet Waves is the non-String division of D'Addario. They make excellent quality everything (even though I'm a GHS string user for life endorsement). I love their auto trim tuners, and all their cables, including their very nice cable ties that simply clip onto any standard size cable and wraps with an elastic tie around and clips to itself. Easy to remove by just a twist if the cable goes bad and you want the tie for a new cable.
