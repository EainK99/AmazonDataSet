Great price! I trust Switchcraft quality - did what it was supposed to. I used four of these along with four standard Switchcraft mono 1/4&#34; plugs in an aluminum project box to make a two channel insert point for the end of my effects pedalboard so I could add in a stereo looper when I needed it before my stereo direct out box.
