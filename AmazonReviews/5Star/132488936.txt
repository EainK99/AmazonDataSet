This has a plastic back and sides, but honestly it sounds quite nice compared to my all-plastic Toys R Us ukulele.<br />I also replaced its included strings with Aquila Nylgut strings and the sound improved, or at least I like to think so.<br /><br />The included gig bag seems to only exist to satisfy the &#34;It comes with a gig bag!&#34; claim, and doesn't provide any sort of protection.
