agreed; these are really ideal. 10s just feel too slinky-dinky for me, and go out of tune too easily, while 11s are too much work and too tough to bend accurately and easily with; I wanted a manly string with great punch and tone, but still with some shredability, and this fit the bill to a tee. I've been using these exclusively on all my Strats and Teles for over a year now, and my rhythms and leads pop better than ever. Couple these with a 1.14 Ultex pick and you are in the grown-up guitar business, brutha. . . .
