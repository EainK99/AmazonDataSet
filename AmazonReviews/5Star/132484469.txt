So first, I absolutely love this product.  Second, I highly recommend it for anyone who has large hands or big fingers, or is learning how to use a pick for the first time.  For first timers, think of it as training wheels that will allow you to get the hang of a pick without the frustrations that many first timers go through, with many giving up and just moving on to finger picking.  I wish we could have an option of a little stronger pick and I know others would like a smaller ring size so keep on developing one of the nicest new evolution's in pick development in some time.  Someday perhaps we can just insert our own picks into the ZeroGravity Orbit?<br /><br />P.S. Have fun moving between strumming and finger picking within the same song with ZeroGravity. It's virtually seamless and opens up a lot of new music possibilities.
