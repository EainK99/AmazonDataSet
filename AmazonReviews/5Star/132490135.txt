These things are awesome. The extra long cable is good for wrapping around a desk like I use it for. The range and clarity is fantastic. Bass is a little weak but what do you expect for $100. It's still THERE, but it doesn't shake the room.<br /><br />Solidly constructed, very comfy (have worn for 12+ hours before), and have withstood many abuses like being run over by my roller chair. May not fit those with small heads.<br /><br />I've had em for a year and a half and these are the best headphones I have.
