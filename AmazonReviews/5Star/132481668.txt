I bought this as my first singing bowl.  Right away I was able to make it sing; it was very easy.  The vibration sounds are very relaxing and seems resonate for the heart chakra.<br /><br />If someone is having a difficult time making it sing be sure you hold it on a flat hand.  Don't cup it.  Holding it flat, or putting it on  a table will allow the striker when rubbed around the rim of the bowl to sing.
