Excellent carrying case. Excellent sound when I run the mics through my mixing board. Make sure you buy a mixer that has phantom power so the two overhead dynamic mics work well. I play a Tama Starclassic and these mics really pick up the punchy sound. Very happy for the money I spent. Stretch the plastic clips with your fingers a little bit to make them easier to snap on to the rim of the drum. But they're tough and you won't break them. I used a pair of pliers to loosen the plastic threaded bolt but I gripped it with a towel so as not to damage the plastic. All in all, this is an excellent product and well worth the money!
