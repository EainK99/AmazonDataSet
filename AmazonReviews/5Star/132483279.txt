I am new to ukulele playing so I cannot give a professional opinion, my opinion is that of a first time owner.  I think this is a great little ukulele.  It took almost three weeks of tuning using the tuner I bought at the same time ([[ASIN:B003VWKPHC Snark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic Tuner]]) for the instrument to come into tune.  Now, it holds fairly well and needs just little adjustments.<br /><br />I have very short fingers and very, very sweaty hands so I am probably not the best candidate to play a ukulele, however, I have been enjoying learning chords and some strumming patterns.  I doubt I will ever do more than mild strumming and picking but I do enjoy learning new things and this is definitely something new.<br /><br />This ukulele, the Mahalo U-30, is a great little instrument, it stays fairly tuned, seems to be of reasonably sturdy construction and looks nice.  I would heartily recommend it for any first-time beginner.
