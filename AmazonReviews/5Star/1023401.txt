I have been a professional musician for over 30 years, and believe me fingerprints transfer at the slightest touch to each instrument I play.  Many times I have carried a soft towel with me to clean my keyboard or saxophone with.  However, this Moozikpro Polishing Cloth is awesome and is 100x softer than any towel could ever hope for.  The microfiber is the secret, and I wish I had thought about this a long time ago.  There’s no chance of scratching anything with this cloth, it is as smooth as silk and feels good to the touch.  I received this cloth at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
