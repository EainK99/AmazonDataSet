Let me preface this review by giving you some background about my experience.  I have been an Audio Engineer for 10+ years and a drummer for much longer.  I have owned the Shure E3c in ears for over 5 years and they have never fit my ears with any of the sleeves that came with them because of my small ear holes.  I was very disappointed at first when I could not use these in ears easily.  After trying all of the sleeves for this model including the triple flange type with no luck I went ahead and had custom molds made for my ears.  The molds that I got were great but it took way too much time to put them in and get wire properly situated behind my head.  This left my favorite shure in ear monitors to sit on the shelf unless I was using them on stage during a show or in the booth at the studio.  Anyway, I am always looking for alternative sleeves to try out and never had any luck until I found these, and now my search is FINALLY OVER!  These foam sleeves are excellent and take no more then 30 seconds to have them in my ears comfortably listening to my ipod.  Finally I can use my shure in ears wherever I go and never have them fall out.  They also provide very good sound isolation from my surroundings, almost as much as the custom molds.  I can finally put my white Apple ear buds away and listen to my music the way it is supposed to be heard.  I plan on purchasing many more of these so I will never have to be without them.  If you, like me, have had a hard time finding comfortable sleeves for your Shure in ear's look no further.  These are the best on the market all around for; ease of use, quality, comfort and most of all, audio bliss.  Buy these now, you will not regret it.
