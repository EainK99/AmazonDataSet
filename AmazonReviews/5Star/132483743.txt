My grandson picked this guitar out, for the looks etc.  It was a birthday present and he loved it.  I liked how it was delivered to my home,, safe and secure.  The inside box with the guitar was also nicely wrapped.  looked more expensive than it was. He is learning to play, and as he said &#34;this is great&#34;  He is 14 years old.
