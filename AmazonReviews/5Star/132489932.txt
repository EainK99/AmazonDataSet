I have tried some various drives for the past 6 years as well as some distortions and fuzzes and have never plugged in a pedal that sounded excellent spot on ! Right from the box, into the amp, turned on the switch and couldn't stop myself from smiling. It made me happy that I decided to buy this pedal as I think it will be one of those things that I will never move / trade / sell, just like when you buy a Cry Baby , you know you'll have years of fun with the unit.<br /><br />About the tone and quality of the pedal, I have nothing to add that you haven't already heard from other reviewers. It is sturdy, excellently made, It's tone is pristine, very natural and adapts to your fingers. And the options are countless, each sounding a bit different than the other, but in the end it all sounds excellent!<br /><br />I play it through a Les Paul on a tube Bugera V22
