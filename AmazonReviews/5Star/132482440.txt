I ordered this Item and have been using it for a couple of months in a band with Songbook software. Yes its is made of plastic but is more sturdy than some would lead you to believe and it works just as advertised. No you do not want to let a 4 ton elephant stand on it but lets be adults here.  I did not write a review until now because now I have a reason to give them 5 stars. I was using it on a windows 7 PC with no problems but was forced to purchase a new laptop and of course it has the dreaded Windows 8. (Not a fan and yes I have been working with computers and IT for 25 years). This pc did not have bluetooth on it so I had to use the dongle that came with it and I have the V4 (newest) version of the pedal. Windows 8 sees it as a keyboard so immediately asks for a pairing code to be typed in, kinda hard with it being a pedal and all. I sent an email to PageFlip Support asking if it worked with Win8 and was pleasantly surprised when not only did I receive a reply in less than 24 hours but was also informed that Yes it will work with Windows 8 and a new dongle based on bluetooth 3.0 was being sent to me FREE of charge. Two days later it arrives and works like a champ. I found it very refreshing that a company these days not only stands behind their product as Windows changes every other week but sent me the corrective HARDWARE free of charge to fix it. So 5 stars and Major Kudos to PageFlips customer service which these days in the US is severely lacking.
