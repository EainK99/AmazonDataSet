This is the first time I used this head.  I'm always looking for an advancement on snare tone control with new products that come out.  I am a very hard playing drummer and have always used Remo Emperor heads in the past due to their 3-ply strength.  As of now this head appears that it will hold it's own over time.  Some benefits about it is that it has some fluid between the plys as well as a outer ring dampener built-in which helps with tone control.  Also, this &#34;coated&#34; head is not like a traditional solid white coat, but it's more of a smoke/opaque finish with that same gritty surface.  All in all, a nice head that I would totally buy again.
