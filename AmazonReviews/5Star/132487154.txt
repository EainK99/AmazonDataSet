I got the speakers for a week. It sounds great in my Ballroom dance party. Most of the dancers thought the speakers must be over $1000.<br />When I told them $435 no tax & no shipping fees. Their reaction were \\"WOW\\"!<br />Buy it if you can!<br />I also had a pair of Seismic SA-15T speaker that bought a year ago, they work fine so far.
