Update:<br />I had no issues with the company. They have been quick to respond, are friendly and quite efficient. I am impressed. They also agreed to change their ad in the future to reflect that this particular product does NOT support the Enttec DPro platform. Due to their response and service I amended my review. Nice folks.<br />***********<br />I tried to run it with Enttec D-pro and, while the computer saw it wS plugged in, it could not communicate with my lights.<br />So- if using with Freestyler: go for it.<br />If using D-pro: don't do it.
