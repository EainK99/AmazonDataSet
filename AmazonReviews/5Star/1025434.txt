I bought this guitar off of Craigslist. It was one of 4 guitars that I was looking at, one other being an Epiphone that I think was more valuable. I played all 4 guitars and just picked the one that sounded the best, and it was this Yamaha. For $70 I got the guitar that I have been playing for the last 3 years. Yes, it is not a Taylor or a Martin, but for the money this is a great sounding guitar. It is sold as a &#34;starter&#34; guitar, but it sounds much better than that! Highly recommended! Even the price of a new one is great for what you get...
