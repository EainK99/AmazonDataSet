The Hercules Alto/Tenor stand is just what I was looking for.  I started with a Hercules Alto stand, but it is too small.  The sax has to be placed just-so and still it has tipped over.  The Alto/Tenor stand accepts the alto quite nicely and is strong and stable.  Don't overlook the feature that the lower support can be moved up or down to accommodate the particulars of your sax bell and pad guards. And it comes with a cheery yellow bag!
