I have been playing the flute for over 35 years ...I improvise to DJ's music in dance clubs...this is a great flute for this type of venue....I have bought several of them over the last few years...it arrives for under 120 dollars including shipping..it arrives well tuned and in good shape...it has a full range of beautiful sounds....I tend to abuse the flutes because I stick them in my belt when I am in the clubs...eventually it gets out of tune...but no problem I just continue to innovate sounds...eventually went it becomes to difficult to play I just give it away and I buy another one...I go thru four to six flutes a year...but at this great price it fits into my budget and creative plan
