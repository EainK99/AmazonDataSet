This is a high value piece of equipment. I bought the XLS 2000 to replace a Cinepro amp for my whole house sound system. I moved the Cinepro to my home theater. When it is time to replace my 3 Cinepro amps, I will buy more Crown amps. The Crown amp is on all day every day and remains cool. It does not get hot and has plenty of power.  My only negative would be the bright display lights on the Crown face, but performance wise it is 10.
