First, to be clear this is only the snare-side hoop (you need to also purchase the [[ASIN:B000EENBGM Gibraltar SC-1410WTT 14 Inch 10 Lug Wood Batter Hoop]] to complete your change-out from flanged or other metal hoops to wood. This does not detract from the value of this hoop. In fact it's an advantage because you need only purchase the hoop you need instead of a complete set of you already have the batter side.<br /><br />This hoop is a thick, multi-ply 'Yamaha' style hoop. It has a cut out for the snare wires instead of a slot so you can remove the hoop without removing your snare wires. This is an advantage when you need to change your snare side heads because you can also remove the head if you loosen snare tension and carefully slide the old head out and the new one in.<br /><br />By itself this hoop will attenuate some snare drum resonance, but not dramatically alter the playing characteristics. However, when combined with the companion wood batter hoop the pair will significantly change a snare drum's characteristics, giving you a lot of surface for cross sticking, and drying out the sound. If that is what you are seeking this is a perfect way to get the sound you want.<br /><br />Since this has the cut-outs for quick changing the hoops you can quickly swap these in or out for metal heads to tailor your snare drum for different situations.
