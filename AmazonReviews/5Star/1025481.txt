They are delicately tuned instruments and a build of up dust in the electronics is just about the worst thing that can be done to one. They need regular and careful cleaning. Just any old cloth will not do. They can scratch or leave a residue from laundry soaps and fabric softeners that will permanently damage my beloved musical companion.<br /><br />Let's face it, I love her, I spent a fortune on her, now I can take care of her like the prize she is! I have a good cloth and and can make her feel loved.  She deserves it!!  The storage pouch will keep this cloth from getting destroyed in that gig bag too.
