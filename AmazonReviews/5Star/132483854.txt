Bought these lights to add a little extra funk to my newly mounted flat screen TV.  It was fairly easy to install and looks great - I'm very pleased with the result!<br /><br />As a tip, I would make sure you have all the polarities plugged in correctly (+ to +, - to -)before applying the adhesive on the back of the strips.  You'll save yourself a lot of trouble that way.<br /><br />All said and done, had more than half of the roll left by the end, which means I can use it for a future application or as a replacement if the ones I put up go out.<br /><br />Would definitely purchase again - 5 stars!
