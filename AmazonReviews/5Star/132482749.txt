My little one is less than a year and she loves this product. It is so much fun to shake and bang against other toys. It has a great handle so it is easy to grasp. It isn't too heavy either, which made it easy for her to play with right away. If you are looking for a toy that makes a great sound and teaches children how to make music this is a perfect toy. We listen to a lot of music in our house and it is a wonderful addition when you want to make noise to go along with it.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product :)
