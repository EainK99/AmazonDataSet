I bought an Yamaha mixing head and it had these strange looking holes in the back, these were where you attached your speaker wires.  The head had regular 1/4&#34; plug holes too for speaker attachment, but I wanted to get the cables that would work in these holes as it was brand new to me.  I've been around pa system for a while and these locking holes were brand new to me.  I don't know why you would want to lock the speaker wire like this as I have never had a problem with keeping the wire attached.  You can see I got the one with the 1/4&#34; plug and the other end is that new fangled locking plug.  It does lock with a twisting action.
