Title's self explanatory, but to flesh it out a bit--I have some nicer axes at home, I just wanted something that I could have to take with me and maybe leave in the car... well, you know, a beater. I looked at cheap used ones, but this package is hard to beat. The guitar plays just fine--the action was slightly high as delivered, but I was able to adjust the truss rod and get it just about perfect with minor effort. The finish is very good, just a slight imperfection on the back.<br />The pickup is a bit of a joke, but it can be plugged in and played, just don't expect much from the volume and tone control (just set the volume all the way up, and back the tone down to mostly &#34;bass&#34; because the trebley-er side sounds pretty harsh.)<br />Some people have complained that the case is cheap, but it's sturdy enough, and it includes a pocket big enough to hold some cheat sheets.<br />So if this is what you're thinking about buying, if you're an experienced player and just want a backup, it's a good deal.<br />[two-year update]<br />This guitar has held up extremely well, consider it's usually in my car and hauled around in that original plastic-bag gig case. It's now selling for about $20 more than I paid for it, and it's well worth it. Upgrading my rating to 5 stars.
