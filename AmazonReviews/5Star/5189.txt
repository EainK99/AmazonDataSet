I follow Andy Partridge on Guitar Coach and he offered this package via an email. I purchased at a special price but it's a heck of a deal at the normal price. Great combination of tutorial, tips, tabs, and backing tracks that will take any beginner to intermediate player into the soloing realm.<br />I like Andy's style of teaching, it's straightforward and practical and really easy to follow. You can also get great instruction on Andy's Guitar Coach app for the iPad Newsstand.
