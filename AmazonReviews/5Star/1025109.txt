I was using a stereo cartridge with a conical stylus to play my 50's and 60's mono records.  I bought the 78 version of this cart and was so impressed with the difference, I decided to buy the LP version.<br /><br />The difference between this and my conical stereo summed to mono is substantial.  Since this cart does not convert vertical stylus travel into audio, my vintage mono LP's play much more quietly. I buy a lot of used records from thrifts and garage sales, and some that have a little wear distortion with the stereo cart play undistorted with this one.<br /><br />It is a high output moving coil, which means you don't need a special pre-amp or step up transformer to get plenty of output signal.<br /><br />Modern mono records (e.g. Beatles mono reissues) are mastered using a stereo cutter.  This cart has enough vertical compliance to allow them to be safely played.  I have the mono reissue of &#34;With the Beatles&#34; and it sounds wonderful!<br /><br />If you have a number of mono LP's (I have a couple of thousand),  this is well worth the modest cost.  PS, if you buy garage sale LP's be sure to clean before playing.
