This one is in use by a 3 year old.  He's probably a little young yet to really appreciate this set, but on the other hand - now is a great time to learn.  This junior drum set is sturdy and well built and should stand up to the beginner play.<br /><br />When it arrives: The two smaller drums are already assembled.  You will need to assemble the heads on the big bass, the beater on the pedal, and of course connect the mounting brackets on top of the bass which support the smaller drums and cymbal.  All of the hardware and snap connectors are very nice quality with an accurate positive fit.  The instructions could be a lot better.  I had to do a little trial and error, but you'll know when you get it right.  One of those things where the assembly is really easy . . . IF YOU HAD DONE IT BEFORE.  Another reviewer suggested that assembly should be done away from the kids -- an excellent suggestion, as I also had to deal with an impatient kid while putting this together, which contributed much to my assembly difficulties.<br /><br />Also, you'll need to provide your own stool (unless your little drummer prefers to stand, like mine does).<br /><br />Notwithstanding the poor instructions, these components are well designed, fit together securely, and will hold up to rugged play. The young ones will feel like they are playing the real thing (I guess it is, in a way).  I'll give it 5 stars simply for the quality of the assembled product.
