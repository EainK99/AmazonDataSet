I am new to playing the guitar, but I have found this to be an excellent guitar to learn on. It is light and thin. I don't have to awkwardly reach over a large body guitar, my arm sit comfortably around it. It came with three picks (of two different weights) and a case. The case is thin and there isn't any padding, but for a free case it's great. This seller has good customer service and good quality products. Get this guitar.
