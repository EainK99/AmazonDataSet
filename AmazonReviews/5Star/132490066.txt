Nice bag, well constructed. Good amount of padding around neck. Zipper goes all the way around the neck to allow it to open fully. We have an older version of the superior 3/4 bag, and the zipper only goes part way up the neck so you have to place the cello neck first into that bag. This one will be much easier to use. Reinforced opening for pin to protrude. Not very much padding on the backpack straps, but since this bag is only being used for storage (not transport), it will be fine.
