I was very pleased with our purchase of this instrument. We read a lot of the reviews and researched how to set a viola up. You can't just take it out and expect it to be perfect and play perfectly. My daughter enjoys playing t and I like that it wasn't expensive until she is sure she wants to invest time and $$$$. Sound is great once it is set up correctly. Not professional orchestra quality but definitely great for a beginner.
