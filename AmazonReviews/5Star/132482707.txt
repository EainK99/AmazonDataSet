I've gone thru several stands and this is by far the most sturdy I've ever had.  I have a casio stage piano (px-150) on the bottom and an old casio cz-1 synth on top.  The synth is a little heavy but ultra rock-steady on the top tier.  BTW, some complain about this stand (and other similar multi tier stands) that the top shelf equipment covers the bottom tier equipment.  The 2nd tier of this stand has no front/back adjustment so you might run into this problem.  My stage piano is not very deep and I have it pulled towards the front of the lower tier and it works great but if you have a deep workstation with controls, lcd's, etc, this will probably be a problem for you  Also, the top tier has no width adjustment, Some other manfacturere's stands have upper tier width adjustments but not this one.  The top tier width can only track the lower tier width.  I have a narrower synth that I may place on the top tier in the future but I'll need to do some rigging as the synth is too narrow for the top tier. All in all, the stand is still super nice.
