Bought this for my daughters first year band.  I could have rented one for 35$ a month or buy this and sound the same for much less.  This is a great kit and is easy to get started.  The case is hard and sturdy and the clarinet feels like it's expensive.<br />Update:  Just bought a Yamaha mouthpiece and some expensive reeds for this clarinet.  This improved the sound a lot.  I would buy this all over again.
