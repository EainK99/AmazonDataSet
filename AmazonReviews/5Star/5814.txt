Excelent crash very warm sound ive got it set on my right as my second crash and a Zildjian ZHT fast crash on my left which is bright so the 2 complement each other well. This is a great cymbal and it looks amazing!<br /><br />UPDATE: Ive had this cymbal now a few months and I can only say it has gotten better sounding with each use it has opened up and blosomsed like a wicked flower of warm crashness and for the price? Ill be checking into MORE Stagg cymbals in the future My hat is off to you at Stagg keep up the Excellent work!!!
