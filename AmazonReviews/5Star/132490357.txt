I purchased this based on other people's reviews; so am afraid I cant really compare it to anything else. I can tell you that the price is significantly cheaper than anything else that seemed to get decent reviews. I purchased it fr&oacute;m the US and paid a small fortune for it to be shipped out here (to Australia) because I couldnt find this partic&uacute;lar model in Oz; and even then, it was cheaper than what I was seeing in Aust.<br />The mic seems great. I use it for voice recording for podcasts. It doesn't pick up much, if any, of the sounds around me - just my voice. The light is on all of the time that it is plugged into the USB socket, which is a bit annoying....but really, if this is the worst feature it has, then it's not too bad huh! and when I say a bit annoying, I mean it is a 1 on a scale of 1 to 100.<br />I'd recommend this mic, I'm really pleased with it.
