I can't say enough about this guitar. In the 60's I owned a Gibson SG, but being in my early 60's now and just wanting to play again after 30 years I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This guitar fits the bill. Sounds & feels much like the Gibson, and I saved enough to buy an amplifier. I'm still a little stiff in the fingers, but the Epiphone plays easy & smooth. The finish isn't perfect, but it's close and the color just sparkles. Would I buy another if needed, yes indeed. I'll never be without a guitar again, and this one fits my need for the perfect guitar. Just plain awesome!!
