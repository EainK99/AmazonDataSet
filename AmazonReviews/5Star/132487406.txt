Ultimate 9 is by far the best of the Native Instruments Komplete series and I would recommend this to anyone.  It is a fantastic product and there is no possible way one could be disappointed.  Just one difference between Ultimate 9 upgrade and Ultimate 8 is that Ultimate 8 came as an external hard drive linked via USB whereas Ultimate 9 comes as a bunch of DVDs like the Komplete packages before.  Not that it makes much of difference though.  Once it has been installed you will love it.
