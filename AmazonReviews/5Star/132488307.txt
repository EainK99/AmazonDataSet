This comes in 2 sizes. I bought the shorter one, and I am 5' 11&#34; and glad I did not get the taller one. Guitarists sit on this and put their feet on the rungs. It is a natural position and allows us to rest our guitar on the knees. A female performer also used it and loved it and she is shorter than me. It has a velour type upholstery on the top and is very cushy. the seat rotates which is nice. It is very well made and just a little heavy, but if it wasn't it would be flimsy. This is a quality product for a good price.
