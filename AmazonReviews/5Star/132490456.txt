I've restrung my guitar countless times without a winder and I finally decided to break down and buy one. All I can say is that I was foolish for not purchasing one sooner because it's extremely helpful and it easily saves me about 15 minutes as opposed to hand winding the strings.<br /><br />This winder is great in particular because the slot that fits over the tuning pegs has &#34;two&#34; sizes that will fit over most peg designs. Also this winder has a built in wire cutter which is convenient as opposed to having multiple tools needed to tune a guitar.<br /><br />My one gripe is that the bridge pin puller does not fit around my stock fender sonoran pins. The puller fits a rounder pin head and might not fit other more rectangular designs (as in my case).
