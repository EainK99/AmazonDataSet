Excellent and easy to install. I couldn't imagine my guitar or any guitar without these!  I detune my guitar to drop C and the 56 gauge 6th string would not fit through the eyelet in the tuner, but the fix was simple. I got a slightly larger sized drill bit and opened up the hole just a bit, then checked to see if the string could pass through. I did this on each side of the hole, I did not pass the bit all the way through the hole!! That would surely damage the pin that clasps the string. It took 5 seconds to perform. If you're not that confident you can always buy a custom set from Sperzel, but it will cost more for sure.
