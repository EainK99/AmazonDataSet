I have been playing for 38 years (JH, HS, college, other groups and now in a wind symphony) and never used a neck strap before.  Maybe because I used to think clarinets don't weigh much, why would I need one?  Now I know that when you need one, it doesn't matter what you thought before or what you think others will think.  You just know it would help.  That's where I am now.  I use it in rehearsals, but not in concerts (because concerts don't last all that long).  I recommend using the strap if you have the need for it.  This works well for me.
