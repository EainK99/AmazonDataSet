One of these came stock on my older model Craviotto Unlimited, and i was so taken with the design and craftsmanship that I specified one for a custom snare drum that I had built. The throw-off is low mass and so well constructed that one has to marvel at the design and manufacturing. However, for the price point you have to ask yourself if it has any real-life value other than a cool factor. There is nothing wrong with that, but bear in mind that if you are planning to specify it for a new snare drum build it is going to add a premium price to the final price.<br /><br />Price aside, the key question is do you need the multi-step positioning of the throw?  I play jazz and some blues and have yet to use (or even need) that feature in a playing situation.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are an orchestral drummer I am betting that you can make a strong, logical case. That makes this throw an essential feature on a custom made snare drum or a lightweight, super reliable replacement of a Nickelworks or the heavy Dunnett R Class throws. I have had too many problems with the Nickelworks and truly dislike the weight of the Dunnett throws, so in that respect this is a viable alternative - and the better designed and built one in my opinion. Also, the hole pattern for all three will work. Be aware that while the hold patterns are interchangeable, where the throw-off you are replacing is located on the shall makes a difference. You need to factor in the distance the throw travels when disengaging and make sure you have sufficient room. I ran into this problem when replacing a Nickelworks throw which was installed relatively low on the shell. This Trick fit the holes, but would not clear the hoops (which were wood.)<br /><br />Bottom line: this is definitely the Rolls-Royce of throws, but it comes with a Rolls price tag too. If you need the features then grab it because you are unlikely to find another brand and model that is multi-step.
