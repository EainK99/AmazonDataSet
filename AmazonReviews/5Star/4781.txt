I've been playing guitar and whatnot for most of my life and do a lot of home recording as a hobby. My main music production setup ties me to my music room/office and is far too bulky to take on trips or even into another room without a lot of bother.<br /><br />The Presonus Audiobox iOne does nearly everything I need and can attach to my Macbook Pro or my iPad and allows me to record up to two channels of audio through an XLR and a TRS plug to my DAW. The iTwo adds a few more bells and whistles and additional ports.<br /><br />I recorded from both sources and didn't detect any noise or extraneous signals. The USB interface was able to stream audio into my DAW with no issues whatsoever.<br /><br />Construction is very good. I love the brushed aluminum case. It makes it feel solid without adding much weight. The knobs have detents and feel good under the fingers. Be sure to keep them healthy by protecting them from impact if you plan on taking the device out and about.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with the Presonus iOne.<br /><br />While I would have prefered MIDI support, I can still use it with the Macbook, but not the iPad. No biggie. Ya get what you pay for.<br /><br />On the spec side: There's 48V available, 24 bit/96Khz D/A with 105db of dynamic range, a 50/50 monitor, headphone jack and two TRS outputs. If you're counting on using the iOne with your iPad, you'll have to supply power through the USB port using the iPad charger or another suitable source. I use a 16000 Ma Lithium-Ion power brick which is able to power both the iOne and the iPad without issue. Power bricks are becoming very affordable, but ensure that it delivers enough current to power both devices.<br /><br />There are several free downloads from Presonus as well as a free app from the iOS store which seems to work fine. Since the iOne and iTwo are class-compliant, you can use nearly any recording software you wish.
