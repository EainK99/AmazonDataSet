I have used this on a couple of gigs so far, and I really like it. It is low profile and out of the way while being very useful. It seems pretty sturdy. The plastic is pretty rigid which makes me think it might break if dropped, but at this price point that is just a reality to deal with. The attachment point around the mic stand can be a little tricky to attach since the cutout is a pretty tight space, but other than that, I have had no problems using it so far. I haven't used the pick holder yet,but it seems almost too tight.
