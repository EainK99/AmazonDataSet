It works well with my Yamaha U1 upright piano, I clip the light on top by opening the top door of the piano. The light covers very well my scores and most of my keys and it is very bright. It is not fancy looking and it is very light weight but it does the job very well. The clips has rubbers which I like very much for not scratching the finish on the piano. This was a good buy I am very happy.
