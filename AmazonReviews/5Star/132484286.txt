First guitar I ever ordered sight unseen, sound unheard.  I'm not at all disappointed.  Well, I was expecting more of a tobacco sunburst, as the stock photo indicates, but the sunburst is darker and nearly blends in with the black edges -- check out some of the youtube videos featuring this guitar and you might get a better idea of the coloring.  Thing is, I've come to love the subtle shade changes of the finish, a beautiful brown hue with purplish undertones.  A nicely constructed guitar, although I may change the position of the neck shoulder strap pin as it doesn't work with my locking strap.  The sound is very different from a dreadnaught due to the smaller, parlor size, but played softly, late at night, this guitar's sound is beautiful!  I know this sounds absurd, but the sound is almost magic, seeming to come from another place than this shiny little guitar.  It can be fingerpicked aggressively and gets its point across nicely as well.  Using a pick, it's alright for strumming, but the bass isn't prominent.  Lead notes sound alright, but mostly I like to play some nice blues on this guitar.  This is a very fine parlor guitar that I think will travel well.
