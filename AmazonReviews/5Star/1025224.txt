Using this finger guide, I was able to play (pretty decent) music my first week of having a violin! I recommend purchasing the accompanying book from their website. This guide truly helps you to learn where every note is and gives you the confidence to keep learning such a difficult instrument. Shipping was also very fast and the customer service was excellent.
