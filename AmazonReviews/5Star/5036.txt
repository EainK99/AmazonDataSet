We were a little hesitant at first to lease from Kennedy because I am on the east coast and Kennedy is on the west coast, however their price was a significant savings over the local company we were leasing from so we decided to try.<br /><br />We are very pleased we made this switch, not only have we saved a significant amount on a monthly basis, the process was quick and seamless.  Kennedy sent a extra pair of strings with the violin and my daughter loves the violin, which has beautiful sound.  We will continue to rent from Kennedy until we are ready to purchase from them.<br />Thanks,<br /><br />Paul and Jesika Guillotte
