I love the tone of this beautiful instrument. I have played it every night for a week. I will be taking this to school to add to the storytime experience in my library. The friction tuners are a dream. I play guitar and cello and the ease of learning the chords to play my favorite songs has been very motivating. I wish that I had started playing string instruments with this little uke! Do yourself a favor and buy a few extras: a great hard case, a chromatic tuner and a ukulele humidifier. This will make you and your uke happy. Aloha!
