I received the unit in record time, the packing was very good, it had bubble wrap on top and bottom. My first impression was, boy is this thing small. I hooked it up to my computer then to a set of headphones, and played a song. I adjusted the volume on my computer up and down. To my amazement the volume to my headphones stayed perfectly stable, no noise or lag what so ever. I plan to install this thing between my mixer out and my 550 watt amp. I am sure it will work flawlessly. The problem I have is the wide variation in volume from one song to another. The unit reacts very fast to volume changes, I just can't believe it. The sound quality is excellent, and being made in the USA makes this unit worry free. I would recommend this unit to anybody that needs a serious volume stabilizer that works more than perfect.
