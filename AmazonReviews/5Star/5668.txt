My father in law scored on a nice keyboard, he grew up playing on guitars and drums, and his kids as well. My husband is in a band with his buddies. They all play something different, so when they come over to our house, and go into the basement (man cave) full of drum sets, pianos, guitars, keyboards, switch boards, and the list goes on. I end up leaving because 6 people end up down there making the house shake. Anyways this keyboard is pretty simple to learn on, great learning tool, with the keyboard pieces light up for whatever song you’re playing to teach you how to play the songs. Comes with a MIC built in, so you can sing into it, and create your own songs, and play them back. The digital board with the buttons, and digital screen is pretty basic, and pretty easy to figure out. The piano is pretty light weight and easy to carry around. Comes with a wall plug or battery options to play either way you like. The keyboard is built great, strong, and durable to drops on any floor. The keys are easy to wipe down for cleaning them. Has a ton of fun features built in for songs, sound effects, and a port to take your recorded songs, onto your computer. The digital screen needs a back light so it can be used in the dark.
