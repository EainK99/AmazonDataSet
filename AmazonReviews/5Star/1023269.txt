I'm an adult beginner and was recommended this model since it would be more motivational to hear yourself playing nicer sounding music on a better violin.  It really is and I am so happy I chose this one.  I actually chose to rent it from Kennedy, which is a great way to go.  Their rental policy is great and their customer service is the best anywhere.  They really go out of their way to help you. This is a wonderful violin package.  The package also comes with a bow, rosin, and a really nice case with a lot of room. The violin is very pretty, sounds beautiful (when played correctly of course), stays in tune very well, and is very enjoyable to learn with. I highly recommend Kennedy Violins and this package specifically!
