My son needed this for his trumpet, and I wasn't sure if it was what he needed but decided to order it anyways for the price.  He said it works great.  The rubber on the clamp is great protection so it doesn't scratch the finish on his new trumpet.  I also bought him a lyre that clamps onto the bell but he uses this one most & is keeping that one that clamps onto the bell as a backup. I think he likes that he can flip his folio around to read music on both sides if needed.
