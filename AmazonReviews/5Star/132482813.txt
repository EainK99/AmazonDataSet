These were bought as a gift for my husband.  He absolutely loves them.  Although we're saving up for a real guitar amplifier at Christmastime, I wanted to get him something to use in the meantime that didn't cost an arm & a leg.  Apparently the sound that these headphones give off is very close to the original model Vox Amplifier.  As a customer, I'm very appreciative of the workmanship & quality of the sound these headphones have to offer.  I would definitely recommend this to any family or friend that is so musically inclined.  Thanks, Vox :o)
