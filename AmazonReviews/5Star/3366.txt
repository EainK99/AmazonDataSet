These have an amazing sound, very warm, very tame, and it's the perfect mix of jazz and concert. I'm definitely making these my new norm. No need to buy a size or two up from what you use on blue box reeds. I have 7 years on the Tenor and Alto Sax, this is the most perfect reed for the sound I want with my Selmer Series II Tenor. These are like blue box reeds except 100 times better.
