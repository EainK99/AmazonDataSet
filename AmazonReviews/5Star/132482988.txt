Bought this item as an used item. it arrive in nearly perfect condition, only thing was a scuff mark on the bottom of the speaker case besides that the speaker looks brand new and the sound is great.<br />The only problem was the power cord included in the box was the wrong power cable but I had plenty of power cords at home so no big deal.
