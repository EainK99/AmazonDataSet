This is a fantastic little tuner.  It's small so it fits in your gig bag, but that doesn't mean it is small on performance features.  Tunes with a very high degree of accuracy, and it is so, so easy to use.  Clip it to your instrument and it tunes based on vibration, or set it in front of your instrument and it tunes using a receiver.  I use it for my cello, but it can tune any instrument or even your vocal performance!  AND it is cheap!  This is a great innovation!!!
