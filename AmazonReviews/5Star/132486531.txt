I have a very expensive cornet and I wanted a case that would protect it but also accommodate mutes, mouthpieces, music and accessories. This case is beautifully made and has room for a K&M horn stand, straight, Harmon, and cup mutes, tuner, valve oil, two mouthpieces, and a lightweight music folder.  The space for my horn (Eclipse with triggers) is perfect. The horn bed is too snug to store the stand in the bell without unscrewing the base and storing it with the mutes but I can  live with that. All in all, a great case for serious players.
