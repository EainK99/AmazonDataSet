I recently ordered an SVK les paul style guitar, and aside from the fact that this guitar is easily as good if not better bang for your buck than my Gibson lp standard, it came without a case. I wanted a brown leather case with a magenta plush interior like my canadian made gibson case, and ended up going with this gorgeous Gator GW model. My guitar fits perfectly inside , and it is simply a well made, beautiful guitar case. Would highly recommend this case to any looking for an affordable, well made case for their lp and lp style guitars.
