I love the way these headphones fit. I can bike, run with no problems. Also these headphones perfect for subway commute as they block all noise. I would not recommend using them while biking in the city or any area that you may need to listen out for your surroundings. Bass quality is great on trance and rap tracks; however, it can be distorted when I listed to Rammstein.
