The guitar arrived on time, and in great shape. The accessories that came with it, tuner, picks, strap, and case, were all as advertised. The guitar has a great tone and the action is easy on the fingers. Overall, a great value for the money. I am very pleased and would recommend this product for beginning guitar players.
