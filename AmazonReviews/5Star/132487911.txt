These are by far the best headphones I have ever owned. They are extremely, crisp and clear, I can hear every instrument easily, bass isn't hugely heavy, but its just the right amount. Don't get Beats, they warp the bass and make it muddy and unclear, these headphones do the job (I listen to plenty of Ben Folds Five). They are also extremely sturdy, despite their plastic construction. The cord is plenty long for anyone I can think of, (definitely get the coiled version), and it doesn't wear thanks to a metal spring around the base of the cable. My only gripe is the size of the audio jack, it's 3.5mm, like it should be for any iPhone or computer, but because it has an adapter, the body of the jack is too big to fit in any phone case, I don't care because I don't use a case, but just something to consider. But seriously, don't look any further, just GET THEM, totally worth every penny!
