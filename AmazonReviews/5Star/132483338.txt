I repair electronic music gear and while I have pretty good lighting on my bench, at times it's difficult to see details on PCB's and inside chassis'  After putting these on my Optivisor,  I no longer have to move chassis around to get shadow free lighting or use a flashlight deep within cabs, etc.  The combo of Optivisor with the light attachment is somewhat pricey, but like any other tools, you get what you pay for and these are high quality. I use these everyday and recommend them to any professional or serious hobbiest.
