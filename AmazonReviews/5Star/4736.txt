I am impressed with the company's idea of &#34;pick as instrument&#34;. Definitely high quality product and worth a try if you have never tried a wood pick. Would highly recommend for acoustic guitars and would be suitable for acoustic electrics, but not really for electric guitar as they are going to be a bit too heavy gauge. That heaviness really gives a great tone to acoustic strumming though and very good single string picking control from the tip.
