This chin rest might not work for everyone, but it sure made a difference for me!  I've been playing for a little over six months and I found that my neck would hurt after practicing.  I happened upon this chin rest on a YouTube video and ordered one and now I can play for up to an hour with no pain whatsoever.  Not to mention it is beautifully made and looks good on my violin!  Ask your instructor about this if you are having neck problems.
