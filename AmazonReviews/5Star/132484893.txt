Wow.  I was completely blown away when I opened the box.  This is a wonderful, beautiful, amazing musical instrument.  Well appointed, nice detail and lovely sound.  This makes my 6th Uke, Everything from Lanikai to Pono and I have to say it is far and away now my favorite.  I am truly stunned at this beauty.  It comes with D'addario strings and the soft Luna gig bag and for a solid top KOA, with Koa back and sides this was an absolute STEAL for the price I paid (194.00 delivered 2nd day (Prime). It retails well above that and worth every penny.<br /><br />I'm only sorry I didn't buy two so my wife and I would have matching Ukes! :)<br />Thank you AMAZON and thank you, thank you Luna.  This is a remarkable ukulele with a beautiful sound.  It is a more mellow sound than you may typically associate with a ukulele, but I am very happy with it.<br /><br />Be advised that in the description this model says it has an on board tuner; that is not the case.  What is does have is an on board preamp.  Definitely a nice touch as it works well on my small amp when I'm looking to plug in :).<br /><br />This is my second Luna uke, and for the money there is considerable value in the instruments I've purchased.  They have no complaints from me :).<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Originally purchased in September 2013.  Now over a year later and I am still extremely happy I bought this beautiful instrument.  I bought her a proper hardshell case to keep safe but it never seems to lay around long enough to get put away.<br /><br />Mahalo.
