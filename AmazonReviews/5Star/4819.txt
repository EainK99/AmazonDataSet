This is a pretty amazing light show. It is a very cool music player.  My teenage son absolutely loves it.  It flashes and does various patterns when music is playing.  The setup was very simple and was not much hassle.  Basically plug and play.  I did receive this product at a promotional rate in exchange for my unbiased review.  I was very impressed with the quality of this product.  One thing I would say that this product could use is a longer cord, but if you have an extension cord you can use that.  Now do not get me wrong this doe's not in any way effect the product itself and this is why I still gave it five stars.  But a longer cord would be very nice.  It has hole in the back so you can attach it to a wall or ceiling.  The speaker sounds great and the led lights are so vibrant.  This is great for a bedroom not quite big enough for a large area.  But all in all I would recommend buys this product.
