I ordered this Guqin on 17 Aug and it was delivered 26 Aug.  I've played guitar most of my life and wanted to learn something new.  After tuning this up it has a really nice sound and tone.  I was contacted by the seller to make sure the item has arrived with no issues and was also given website links to help learn how to play the Guqin.  For the price it is extremely well crafted.  Only thing you may want to do is get a better case as this one doesn't have any padding, but I haven't had any issues with mine yet.  I'd definitely recommend buying this if you are interested in trying a new musical instrument.
