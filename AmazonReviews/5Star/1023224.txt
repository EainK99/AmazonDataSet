Just returned a broken Tascam TM-2X and bought this instead. Build quality is MUCH better with metal parts including the all important hotshoe mount! This thing is very lightweight and looks great on top of my Canon T5i for my family home videos. Sound is obviously much better quality than onboard mic but don't expect amazing professional sound out of something at this price point. It's perfect for family home videos, kid's school recitals, etc.. anything more professional than that and you'll be better off hiring a sound crew!
