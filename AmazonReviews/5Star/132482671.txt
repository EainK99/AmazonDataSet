Looks and sounds very distinctive, which is rare in the guitar world.<br /><br />Very classy, very well made, very nice to play, very beautiful.<br /><br />I have several guitars, and this is one of my top two favorites (along with my Eastwood Airline '59 Custom, which has great and distinctive tones and look also).<br /><br />A fantastic value at full price.
