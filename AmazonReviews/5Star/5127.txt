The Supa Charger is a great alternative for someone that doesn't want to spend so much on a power supply. I only have 7 pedals but they are not power hogs like a styrmon or anything like that. I had a one spot and that was alright but I wanted something more dependable. The Supa charger fit the bill and fit under my pedal board also. Overall a good unit and I would recommend it
