Purchased this for use with a used Vito alto sax.  The cleaning tool works great for wiping out the moisture from the sax. the weighted string is long enough to allow one to reach it from the bell.  Cork grease works fine on cork.  Have not used anything else in the kit.  Comes with what I used to call a book of &#34;cigar papers&#34; to clean pad surface and some other items which we have not needed.  No complaints.
