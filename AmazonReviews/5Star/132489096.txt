I bought this after reading the reviews and am very happy with the product.  I had no trouble figuring out how to use it and was easily able to record from a record to a CD.  I set the decibel level to 20db and it automatically created all the tracks on the CD.  Recording quality was excellent.  So easy to do!  I have lots of records and will be busy creating CDs for them.  Using the output on the back, I hooked it up to my preamp and it sounds great through my speakers.  The sound without the external connection is not high quality.
