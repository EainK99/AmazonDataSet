Greetings,<br /><br />When I first bought this unit, I was having trouble getting it to work on any of my Windows machines.  iConnectivity was very responsive and helped me reset my firmware, which solved the problem.  I feel much better about my purchase now.<br /><br />The hardware is built very well, and looks fantastic.  The concept of allowing for 2 different machines (whether Mac, PC or iOS) interconnect with a single MIDI/USB device is sheer genius!  Did I mention the built in midi filtering/routing/and processing built into the hardware?  That alone could be worth the price of this interface.<br /><br />This is a perfect midi device for routing MIDI from your OSX apps directly to your Windows 7 apps running inside of Parallels on your Mac. That's how I am using it, and it works great with very low latencies.<br /><br />Great product and a great company.  Highly recommended!
