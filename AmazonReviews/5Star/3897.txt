I received the keyboard a few days ago. I use to play when I was younger but decided to get this keyboard to help me with my arthritic hands. I'm only in my fifties, but I have RA and found out that playing the piano is excellent therapy.<br />I'm saying all that because I thought I'd purchase a little cheap keyboard.  To my surprise, I received a really nice large keyboard with a stand for a small price.  The keyboard was packed well, shipped really fast and works great. i highly recommend the keyboard for the beginner and novice.
