I wanted to leave a quick note for anyone who has bought this.....it works awesome but something that I couldn't find the answer for was how to disable the built in mics when recording with the line in jack....it's easy actually.....turn down the input level all the way and adjust the input level on whatever you're running into that jack. As far as the guitar / mic jack, that automatically disables the mics when you plug in.<br /><br />I like being able to use the built in mics when running a keyboard into the line in jack....nice feature.<br /><br />I was surprised to find that this records better than when I sample with my Yamaha Motif ES.<br /><br />Also, this has 64 tracks though you can only play 8 at once.  Each of the eight tracks has eight virtual tracks but you can only use one at once.....this is nice for multiple takes or whatever.....multiple takes lets the song sound fresh and not like a carbon copy of previous verses.<br /><br />The load and save times are really fast....with my Motif ES, loading and saving samples is painfully slow, sometimes taking 10 minutes or more each time.....that totally kills workflow and you forget your musical ideas, but if you don't save your work every 5 minutes or so, if there would ever be a hiccup in the electricity, you lose everything you have done since your last save.<br /><br />For the Boss I would buy the high speed cards to make everything work better.<br /><br />One other thing, Boss equipment seems to really stand the test of time.....some other new multi-tracks are known to fry without warning for no reason from time to time (I have read the reviews for sooooooo many). Roland also has free phone support for 4 hours on mondays, wednesdays & fridays to walk you through anything you need help with, even if it's out of warranty and you bought it used. Korg won't help you if your equipment is out of warranty. Yamaha has really good phone help with problems as well.....they usually have to call you back though.<br /><br />I hope this helps !!!!
