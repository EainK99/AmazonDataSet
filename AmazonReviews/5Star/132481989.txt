Got mine yesterday.  It's plain out neat. The humbuckers have a Marshall growl which makes the guitar sound differently than a Les Paul. I wished it had separate controls for the bridge and the neck but I'll live. I got the black and gold model. It's the same animal as the fancy quilted models. Just $500 cheaper. The gold is spectacular, the black is also well done. Really really nice sound. Great construction!  Very we'll thought out!  Great addition to my collection.
