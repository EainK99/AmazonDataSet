This hardware pack is surprisingly high quality for being a mid-line series pack. As with all DW products, the engineering and design is remarkable. They really know how to design stuff that is easy to figure out and use with one hand. The bass pedal and high hat stands are smooth and quick as anything else I’ve tried. Very happy with this purchase.
