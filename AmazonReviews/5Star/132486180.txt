Got this for my daughter who is playing the flute. She pulled it out of the box and set it up without any problems.<br />The tighteners are metal and the stand is steady.<br />Because it is made to be portable, it is very light and is not made for heavy or really thick music books.<br />But because she is playing flute this is the stand she needed.<br />She loves it.
