I needed a way to stack two keyboards and was looking for a dedicated stand, then, I came upon this second tier unit. This allowed me to use my original heavy duty stand. The KSA7500 was easy to put together and attach. I note that breaking down the stands for transport is simple and efficient. This was the ideal addition for my keyboard setup.
