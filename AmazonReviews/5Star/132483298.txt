I have owned two inexpensive guitars over the years after taking guitar lessons in Spain 40 years ago.  I am not a professional musician.  I'm just an ordinary guy who likes to play music on guitar for my own enjoyment.  I've always wanted to own a \\"quality\\" guitar.  I was not interested in spending thousands of dollars on one a professional musician might own, but I wanted a nice guitar.  After a lengthy search and a lot of consideration I decided to buy the Cordoba C7 classical guitar.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The guitar is shipped inside the included gig bag and packed in a box with newsprint to keep it from bouncing around in the box.  I was surprised it was not packed in protective Styrofoam, but the gig bag is much more rigid and sturdier than I expected and provides a lot of protection for the guitar.  There was no shipping damage whatsoever.  The gig bag is well-padded and firm.  There is a thick padded piece inside to support the neck of the guitar.  The outside of the bag has a zippered pocket to hold accessories.  The bag has both a carry handle and straps so it can be worn like a backpack.<br /><br />The guitar itself is absolutely beautiful.  Much criticism has been made about it being made in China, but the manufacture of this guitar is very good, and I could find no flaws in the fit or finish of the instrument.  The detailed decoration on the tuning knob hardware really reflects some nice workmanship.  The guitar arrived pre-strung, although it required some tuning.  Once tuned, though, the tone was magnificent.  There was not a buzz to be heard.  The guitar is very lightweight and weighs much less than my older, lower cost guitars.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this purchase.  If you want a good quality guitar with great sound and an affordable price, the Cordoba C7 is well worth consideration.  The price has been dropping on this instrument.  I bought it when the price dropped to $449, and I now see Amazon is selling it for $100 less.  Even though I paid $100 more for it the guitar is still worth the price.gh I paid $100 more for it the guitar is still worth the price.
