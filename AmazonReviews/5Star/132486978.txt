This is everything it says it is. The battery last a really long time. I left it on for three days, and it still works.  The mic capsule is very small, even for a lavalier mic, which I like a lot. The cord is very, very long. In fact, it's almost so long that it's bothersome! But I guess it's better too long than too short. I have a few desktop microphones and the Zoom H1 handheld recorder/Mic, and this is in second place to the H1 in terms of sound quality. That's very very good for a mic at this price.
