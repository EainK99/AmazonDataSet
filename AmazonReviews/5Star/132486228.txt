The six-foot extension for my ear buds works like I hoped it would. Both the male and female ends provide a secure connection with normal plug in/unplug force. I could not detect any loss of signal strength when listening to my music. The quality of this cable gives me the impression it will work forever. With so many similar products available from Amazon, it was hard to choose. This product costs a bit more but was well worth it to get a quality product. I would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to avoid getting stuck with a cheap product and doesn't mind the added expense for quality.
