I bought my second one of these units today. One (silver) I bought last year for my brothers birthday and one last month (red) for my wife's art room. Both work flawlessly. The audio is nice, crisp, and clear exactly the vinyl sound I was expecting to hear at this price point. Use of the unit is extremely simple. Press start and it plays automatically. Press stop to stop playing and put the arm back. Pause to just raise up the arm/needle but put put it back so you can continue where u where. It comes with the 45RPM adapter and a nice starter pad. I'll probably end up getting a deer hide leather mat for my wife's like my brother did.<br /><br />Overall this unit is a really good bang for your buck. I would highly recommend this unit!
