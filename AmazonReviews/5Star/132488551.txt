I can just give you a first impression rating as I just received the matching cab yesterday. But this thing is quite loud. I am finding I am going to need to turn this amp up and my guitar down to get that good tube sound. Otherwise, its just too loud. I changed the tubes while waiting for the cab and will use the stock ones as a backup. I am very pleased with the sound of the amp and cab. I might change to a different speaker down the line, but just using at home at this point, so the stock is fine for now. I have spent about $225 total with tube replacements. For a 'half stack\\" I just dont know if you can beat it for the price and quality. I have a Les Paul copy so I cant speak for the sound with single coils, but I am betting it might sound even be better than humbuckers. I would highly recommend, but it is loud.
