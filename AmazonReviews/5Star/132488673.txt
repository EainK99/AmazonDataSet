I just recently took interest in learning to play the digderidoo, and I came accross this one. It may be plastic and seemingly cheap construction, but the sound isn't half bad. After a few months, I already have the circular breathing down and know a few different rythyms. This didge is a steal for anyone. I definitely recommend buying one like this if you are a beginner, instead of spending alot more on a genuine termite-hollowed didge.
