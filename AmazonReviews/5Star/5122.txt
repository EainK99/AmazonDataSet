Kennedy Violins has been an affordable, quick and easy way to rent my daughter's violin as she's studied violin over the past five years.  We've been able to easy swap out violins as she's outgrown to the next size, and their staff has been attentive in responding to our questions or needs.  Each instrument we've rented has been of good quality.
