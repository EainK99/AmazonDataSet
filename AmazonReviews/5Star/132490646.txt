I bought this vibe pedal over a year ago, and it has been a mainstay on my pedalboard ever since.<br />I wanted a modulation effect last year, but I didn't want to go with the typical MXR Phase 90. That's when I stumbled upon vibe pedals.<br />There are 3 main sounds that I have found to be useful with this effect pedal:<br /><br />1. The Rotary Speaker (Vibe Effect Selected)<br />For this sound, turn depth knob to noon, the hue to 5 o'clock, and the rate anywhere between 10 and 3 o'clock.<br />This gives a nice warbly shimmer. I like to use it on rhythm sections as it gives a nice depth to your sound, but doesn't overpower your tone. It's a typical rotary speaker sound, and it sounds great.<br /><br />2. The Jimi-Vibe (Vibe Effect Selected)<br />For this one, you need an overdriven amplifier or a cranked dirt pedal in your pedal chain. Set the depth to 3 o'clock, the rate to 8 o'clock, and the hue to anywhere from noon to 3 o'clock. Be warned -- this is going to diminish your highs, but it's great for solo work, especially if you are already using a fuzz pedal for the song. If you are a Jimi Hendrix fan, this is typically how he's associated with using the Uni-vibe pedal.<br /><br />3. The Gentle Hand (Chorus Effect Selected)<br />This is how I mainly use this pedal, and it is vastly different from the way I envisioned using it when I first purchased it.<br />For this, set the rate to 9 o'clock and both the depth and hue to noon. The chorus effect on this pedal is so subtle, you might not even notice it. As such, I use this as an always on effect. It give nice a subtle variation in your tone and works well with both solo and rhythm guitar work. Where this effect really comes in handy though, is when you use a delay pedal. When you kick in the delay though, what you end up with sounds much more like an actual chorus effect pedal. It doesn't cancel out your delay effect though, so the end result sounds like a chorus effect and delay pedal activated together. It's quite useful.<br /><br />Notes: I play in a church and use this effect almost every Sunday. Its thick and heavy metal construction has held up and the small switch located on the top of the effect pedal has been completely safe (Originally, I thought that would be an issue). I use a small pedalboard with 5 effects chained together. In order, those are: Vox Classic Wah, Moen Shaky Jimi, Danelectro Transparent Overdrive V2, Joyo Digital Delay, and ModkitsDIY The Verb Deluxe.<br />I typically use my AXL Badwater SRO with upgraded electronics.
