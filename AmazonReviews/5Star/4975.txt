I have tried many shakers in search for something that fits my performance style, and I've found it in this Meinl shaker; I play drums for a band that performs regularly, and occasionally we do an &#34;unplugged&#34; set when I switch to a cajon. I play the shaker with my right hand, the one that is usually on the Hi-hat of my kit. I have been looking for a shaker that feels a little like a drumstick, not too heavy and with decent volume. This Proton shaker is exactly what I was looking for! It's light weight, has decent volume for live performances and feels great in my hand. You can get a variety of rhythms by holding it in different positions. I have only used it for a handful of shows so far, but it has already out performed the LP shakers that I have tried. It's well made and performs well; great product!
