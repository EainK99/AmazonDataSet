I have been an audio professional for 27 years and I have to say this thing is brilliant. All of the negative reviews here have one of two things in common: they were not using the iRig for its intended purpose or they did not know how to use and care for it.<br /><br />It's a simple device to use and works well with iPhone or my Samsung Galaxy S4. That's what it's made for and it does it very, very well.<br /><br />That said, it's an electronic device and if you don't treat it like one it will eventually, like all electronic products, let you down. Permanently attached cables need to be cared for, coiled neatly and attached via the velcro strap when not in use. Chucking it into a gearbag with a million other hard metal products will damage it. If you don't want to look after it, don't buy it, and if you do then don't take to public forums to whine about it's supposed lack of build quality.<br /><br />The sound quality on the iRig Pre is excellent and I use it for commercial radio all the time. It's biggest problem is in fact in its very simplicity: it looks like any idiot could use it but judging by some of the reviews here, not all idiots can.
