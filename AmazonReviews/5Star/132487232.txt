I put one of these on my banjo and its a very good pickup. Placement was critical and I tried several locations. I had to finally mount it on the inside as it wouldn't stick to the weather-guard finish on the plastic head. Don't know about natural heads.<br />The lead is a bit short and I had to fool with the location, but if it were longer, it might be clumsy and interfere with the string picking.<br />Its listed as a violin pickup, but it works on the flute, the ukelele, and other instruments as long as you can find a place to adhere it.<br />The sound quality is good and runs really well through the amp with no distortion or crystal cheep. Amazing price, good item. I recommend it.  It would make a good acoustic guitar pick-up, but know the lead is very short. Also, I had to goop the plug into the velco as it comes off under pressure.  The adherence tab also comes loose due to the adhesive but also consider that stronger or a different glue choice may cause finish problems. it looks good enough to be on the outside and with imagination becomes its own art object.  Remember that the more basic something is, the more versatile it becomes.
