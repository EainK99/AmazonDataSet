I've been looking for a high quality uke case for my Kanilea Tenor with little success until now.  I thought about a Calton, and they are surely marvelous, just couldn't spring for an $800 case for this instrument.  This one fills the bill nicely.  The case is well made, well finished, and fits my instrument extremely well.  If you are looking for a top end uke case, consider these, you will not be disappointed.
