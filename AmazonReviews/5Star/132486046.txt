These things have everything and more that the pioneer 2000's don't' have. I would suggest if you want a great CDJ that has it all and can do basically everything a P 2000 can then buy theses. Look at this way you don't need the most expensive equip in your studio let the clubs spend their money on that because in the end these things work exactly the same and when you roll into to the club to play your set on some P 2000's your not go even know the difference!!!
