Words From My Son: &#34; this Is my first extended range guitar and I am thrilled! I agree with some of these people when they say the pickups aren't the best, but they aren't bad, not bad at all, it actually sounds fantastic the bridge pu makes the f# sounds weak/quiet though. The Neck pickup sounds kinda woody and hollow but isn't too bad. The action is great and it feels really good to play, I have rather large hands so it is actually easier for me to play than a 6 string. Basically a quick pickup change, string replacement and a little finish on the neck and this guitar would be absolutely perfect!
