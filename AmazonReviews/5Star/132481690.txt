I have had inconsistent results with the larger K Constantinople rides, but this model nails the sound I am looking for in lower volume playing. In fact, this particular model will hold its own in moderately amplified settings as well.<br /><br />The fundamental pitch is low and carries in the mix. For recording this may carry a little too much and drive the engineer nuts, but for live playing it has a definite presence. While there is a wash each note can be easily heard without getting lost in a sea of over and under tones. That allows you to play some very fast triplet ostinatos and still control this cymbal. I have had too many cymbals get away from me due to oscillations, but this one stays right there.<br /><br />Do not expect to get clear notes from the bell. For some reason there are overtones when you play it. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but if you play Latin or Brazilian grooves you are probably going to hate that aspect of this cymbal. Also, for crashes this is better as an accent because the crash sound is slightly gong-like.<br /><br />While I have pointed out some weaknesses this is still the perfect cymbal for me and I doubt I will find another model that I love more. The weaknesses for some are pluses for others - I merely am describing this cymbal the best I can. One final note: these vary from one cymbal to the next. I tried three before finding the one that 'called out to me' so my description is in the ball park, but there will be nuances and variations among this model. It's best to try them in person before investing in one.
