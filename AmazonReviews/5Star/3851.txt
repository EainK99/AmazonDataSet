The first one I got was so bad, It cut out so bad that if you moved couple steps it lost the RF signal with the receiver.  I contacted the vendor for a replacment.  They sent the replacement unit in two days. The second unit works very good, I could move around my house without any cut out.  I enjoy singing Karaoke with this model.
