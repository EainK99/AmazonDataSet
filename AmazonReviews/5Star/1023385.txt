This is a great product.  Be warned.  There are no instructions, the web-site is not helpful and calling the factory does no good when it comes to getting it hooked up.  First attempt at hook up resulted in no sound from the amplifiers.  The units had to be wired for grounding before sound was produced.  A lot of extra time and frustration, but NO AUDIO HUM.
