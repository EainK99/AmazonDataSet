So first off, this was delivered via UPS, which I hadn't had a problem with before, but this time whomever delivered failed to knock or ring the (working) doorbell. So they left it on the porch, so of course I didn't realize it was even there until tracking my packages and seeing \\"delivered, on porch\\". Went outside, package destroyed by stray dogs. It was SUPPOSED to be a Christmas present for my husband, but he was home and caught on after I called UPS in a blind rage. It only had a scratch on the top of it, so it was ok with him.<br /><br />Aside from that, this things made of thick metal. Its just like a paper punch, and he's punched everything he can find in the house, including old drivers licenses, to pro-cards. He LOVES it. He loves the thickness, and clean edges of the picks. It came with several strips to punch (which seem pretty thick, but most of ours didnt survive) and a pick holder.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for your guitarist! [just pay attention to when it might arrive]
