I purchased this clarenet for my daughter, she is just begining to take lessons and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I purchase the refurbished model hoping for a clarenet that was for all intensive purposes practicly new. The clarenet arrived in record time and I was not disapointed in the quality/condition of the clarenet that was sent.
