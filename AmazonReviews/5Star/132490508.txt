This is the 2nd time I have purchased the WI Digital Wireless for use with a guitar.  Got this one for our bass player.  They both work great, but have a small amount of delay.  The 2 units do not interfere with each other and up to 10 transmitters can be used without any interference.  The delay is really not an issue, but if one is particular about small minor problems then you should look else where for a wireless unit.
