I'm a mobile DJ and have two JBL cabinets powered by two 1000W Crate amps. I was missing some of the low end of my audio and didn't really want to invest in a set of subs and another amp(s). My buddy told me about this processor and I checked it out. I had it in my rack 10 minutes and already was in love with it. The highs are crisp and clean and the lows come out of the mud and greet the ear. It has definitely redefined the way my gear sounds and I'm already thinking of ways to integrate it into my home studio as well.
