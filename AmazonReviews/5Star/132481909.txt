I gave this combo 5 stars because the headphones were GREAT.  They were pretty decent at noise cancelling but not to the extent of Bose Q15.  Then again, I find ATH-M50 much more affordable (half the cost of Bose Q15).  What you pay for is what you get. They are a bit bulky, and somewhat heavy. Personally, the bass was just right for me.  However, if you feel the need for more bass, plug up that amplifier. And yes, I did receive the FiiO E6 amp for those that are skeptical of receiving E6.  But, the one of the usb hinges fell off as I was plugging it into my usb to charge.  I'll post a picture.  Overall, I LOVE IT!!
