These drums are fantastic and even better when you consider the price. I have a DW Collector's series also and am using these as gigging drums now. They really sound great and mic up very nicely and maintain their tune. I have the 7 piece kit and could not be happier. If money is no object go for the Collector's but if you are looking for a great sounding all around kit definitely consider these, you will not be sorry.
