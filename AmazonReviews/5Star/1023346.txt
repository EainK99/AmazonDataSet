For under $300, I can't think of a better five string, especially if one prefers a 19mm spaced bridge.  The set neck also a totally different animal that most instruments in this price point.  My only possible comment would be the color...I have never been a fan of black guitars, but that is personal and only cosmetic.  My DBZ Imperial 5 plays great and sounds awesome.
