I have had a few pop filters in the past, however, this was the cheapest one I have ever bought and has so far been the best one too.  I love the length of the arm, it is long enough to place the pop filter pretty much anywhere while still covering your mic.  The dual screen mechanism does seem to almost permanently help avoid pops while it maintains your crisp sounds too.  My only gripe has been the fastener which uses a screw tightening mechanism which pushes against an beveled shaped clamp.  Of course the design was made to fit against any round pole mainly mic stands, but the design is kind of sloppy and can become loose on its own.  Preferably I would have loved to see like an actual simple clip or some other type of mechanism because there isn't always a mic stand to clip on.  Despite this complaint, the pros by far make this a great buy if you are looking for an affordable basic pop filter.
