I have odd sizes for floor toms (13 and 15) and I've used these heads for years. Used in conjunction with the EC resonant bottom heads, they allow accurate tuning, great response, and flush out unwanted overtones. I always get the coated because they tend to be a bit warmer sounding. The clear version of these do add more articulation however. Love Evans and will use the EC2's til my hands give out!
