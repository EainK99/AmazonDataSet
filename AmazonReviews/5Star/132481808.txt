I needed longer patch cables to run through the back of my rack unit for my bass cab. 6 inch and 1 foot just weren't long enough, and most of those aren't shielded well. I also didn't want to cut down longer cables and splice my own ends on because I suck at soldering.<br /><br />So these cables were a life saver. My rack is clean and organized with minimal clutter because the cables aren't laying around all over the place, and they are super high quality. Loved the shielding, they feel like they'll last for forever in there.
