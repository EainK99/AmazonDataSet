I don't think my piddly review of this well-established icon is going to matter a whole bunch.  It stands on its own.  I would just like to find the person who set the price (l-o-o-o-w) on the one I purchased and buy him or her a case of high octane beer.  Thanks, whoever you are. I got a remarkable deal on a remarkable guitar.
