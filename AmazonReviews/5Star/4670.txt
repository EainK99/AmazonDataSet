Great for first studio monitors. I would imagine you could get better sound from something far more expensive but  when I plugged these in and listened I was mindboghled how great they sounded. It sounds far better than all of my amplifiers combined and it has amazing clarity. Good buy, also don't buy the Amazon warranty when suggested, it already comes with a warranty.
