I'm not a PRO, so if you need to know about sound quality, compatibility with other equipment, etc., please read other reviews.  What I can tell you is that the unit I received seems very well built and is extremely easy to play (compared for example to a clarinet).  A word of caution: the software is not necessarily the easiest to setup.  In other words, you may (or may not) be able to just plug the device and begin playing.  This is a bit unfortunate because I find the hardware to be superb.  If you are capable of overcoming the software / drivers issues on your particular PC / OS, you will not be disappointed with the results.
