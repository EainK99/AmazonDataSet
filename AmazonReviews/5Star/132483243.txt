Just like the title says.  It's great, the quality overall is great.  I don't feel any cheapness around at all.<br /><br />it's worth the money.<br /><br />If anything, it's not set up, so you'll have to do that.  But it's awesome.  WORTH IT.  the seller I bought from was \\"Sound of Asia Musical Instruments\\"<br /><br />and they ship/deliver VERY FAST.  I recommend them.
