Most of the time, the old axiom, &#34;you get what you pat for&#34; is true. Regarding other guitar electronics, like jacks, I'll always choose the real-deal Switchcraft. They're the only jacks which will work for more than a few minutes.<br />In this case however, I thought I'd take a chance, because the Switchcraft version of this doesn't come in black.  So far, it works perfectly, and ive already beaten the hell out of it for many gigs and rehearsals.<br />Buy with confidence and save some money!
