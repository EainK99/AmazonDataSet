First, to dispel some points of confusion about this instrument and tiples in general.  This is the traditional tiple from Colombia, not the Hawaiian type built around the mid-20th century, most famously by martin.  I believe the product description erroneously specifies the tuning as CEAD; this instrument should be tuned e b g d, with the b, g, and d courses octaved.  That being said, after breaking one of the octived b-strings while trying to tune the instrument that high, I now tune it a whole step lower, (d a f c), and use a capo or just play it in that tuning.  (Note that this tuning is like the top 4 strings of a guitar or a ukulele.<br /><br />The tiple is rock solid!  The wood, (walnut and jacaranda,) is thicker than a normal guitar (to withstand the tension of 12 nylon and bronze strings,) and the bridge is well reinforced.  Ecuador Mall suggested de-tuning the instrument before periods of prolonged non-use in an e-mail because the instrument does not have a truss rod; although the neck is very very sturdy.  The tuning pegs work well.  The intonation is more than I could have hoped; all frets play the correct notes and notes do not become flat or sharp when playing up the fretboard.  Very impressive!  The instrument fits perfectly in a requinto/half-sized classical guitar case.
