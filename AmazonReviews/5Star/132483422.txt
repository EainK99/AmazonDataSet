I have tried other locks that have the smaller profile but I never felt that they were really solid.<br />These Ernie Balls are great, once locked down they are rock-solid. I have them on both of my bass guitars, chrome for my red Ibanez and I got the black one for my new Fender. These are definitely standard accessories for every guitarist out there.
