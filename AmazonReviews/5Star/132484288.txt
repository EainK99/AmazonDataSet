If you are like me and love keeping your guitars in mint, scratch-free condition - then get this kit. The two cloths that come with are amazing. I have used other products that do not work half as good without the cloths. The blue cloth really cleans, buffs and shines your guitar and the black cloth is for the fret board and getting all of the gunk off of it. Fret boards and frets get really dirty from oily fingers and sweat - this gets it off and makes the wood look new again. The chemicals all work great, especially the fret board oil - much better than plain lemon oil that I was using. It penetrates and lasts so much longer.
