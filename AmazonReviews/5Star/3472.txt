Have had this for about a week now and so far, we love it!  Arrived within a week of ordering it.  This is for my 9 year old as an upgrade to her cheap, 56 key keyboard she had from years ago.  She has been taking piano lessons for 5 months now and really seems to be enjoying it so felt an upgrade was in order.  The sound is great.  If you closed your eyes, you would definitely think you were listening to a full piano.  We haven't tried exploring all the fun functions yet but will soon!
