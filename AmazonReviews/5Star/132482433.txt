I chose this case partly due to the measurements; I needed something to fit an old Boss Multi-Effect unit, the ME-10, which fits PERFECTLY, including cables and a volume control pedal.<br /><br />Also picked this one because I already own 2 Gator guitar cases, and found them well made and very protective.<br /><br />I don't use the shoulder strap, but including it is a BIG PLUS for Gator.<br /><br />Check your unit's measurements to be sure; if this is the size you need for your unit, this is an EXCELLENT choice.
