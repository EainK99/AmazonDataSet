By far the best pedal on the market. I have tried dw 9000's, dw 3000's and demon drives and this destroys all of them. Feels great on your foot easily adjustable to any drummer within seconds. The build is incredible. This pedal works for any genre of music. I have a double pedal on the power setting and even with the power it is faster then any pedal including axis.
