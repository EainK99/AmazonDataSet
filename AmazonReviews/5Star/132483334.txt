I also am a local DJ and have used peavey speakers and amps, and last was Vegas with hybrid amp , I just picked up a new gig and they loved my shows but my Vegas did jot have the clarity at the mid volume levels and acoustic of building was little more echo effect than places in past. I purchased the seismic amp mg4000 as well to go along with these speakers and let me tell you the sound quality is clear and crisp at all levels. They bar tender and bar manager was amazed at the sound once I started playing. They absolutely love the sound. I can not even get the amp or speakers to there max level or you can not even talk in this building that holds around 200 people . Way to go seismic for great sound.
