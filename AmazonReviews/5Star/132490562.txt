Works fine and easy to locate in darker areas when not connected to pedals.<br />It is a bit tight with straight AC adapter plugs but has enough clearance to work<br />without pinching the adapter cable end too much.<br />I use it mainly with 2 pedals on a table or otherwise elevated not on a pedal board or floor.
