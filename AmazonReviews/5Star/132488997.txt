Stuck these on my patio umbrella (yes they come with a tape backing) and used an old 12vdc transformer to power them - now there is plenty of light to sit out all night and work on the patio.  Just like others, you need to snip at the indicated locations and yes you need to &#34;clean&#34; some of silicon from where you snipped so the connectors will fit and produce a good connection.  Used a pocket knife for this - no problems.
