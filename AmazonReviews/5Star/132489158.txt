I bought this amp 2 weeks ago. I bought it for band practice. We play metal in a not-so-big room to practice in, yet this amp still more than overpowered the fast and loud drumming. If you are buying this amp, you will not be upset about the volume level that this thing can reach. Especially for the price. This amp has two basic effects which are very useful. The distortion is great, but not chunky enough for metal. perfect for rock and blues though. this amp is a great buy, but i recommend buying a distortion pedal if you dont already have one.
