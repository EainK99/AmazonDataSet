I bought these phones because I was in a temporary situation in which it was difficult to play my studio monitors at any volume, and I needed to do some preliminary cleaning up of tracks and mixing.  I've always had pretty poor results trying to eq or mix over phones, but these did very well, They sound flat, and have the required upper mid and high end detail needed for basic sound work.  The rough mixes I did transported quite well to loudspeakers.<br /><br />I understand the the ear pads do not always last long, and they are a little hot, but this is the price you pay for a good seal and outside sound insulation. In short, if you're looking for something that is reasonably flat, and reasonably emulates a pair of studio monitors, these are a good choice.  I personally like the sound of dead-flat monitors, but this may not be to eveyone's taste for home listening.  if you want hyped-up bass, or a nice \\"warm\\" sound with the high mids scooped out, these are probably not for you.
