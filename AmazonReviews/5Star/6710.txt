I am finally attempting the violin!  I played trumpet and horn growing up, but always had an appreciation for the String section!  I would always say that I would &#34;learn violin one day.&#34;<br />This starter kit includes everything I need to start my new hobby, so I feel like there is value built-in to this purchase.  I also appreciate how light the case is.  Much better than the heavy horn cases I used to drag around! As far as the instrument itself: beautiful!  The materials appear to be of nice quality, and the color of the wood is very rich!<br />Though I can't yet play a song, I was able to use the bow to test the strings.  This violin has a clear, rich sound.  So far, I am very impressed with this item.  I can't wait until I can actually play it!  This should suit my needs for a long time to come!
