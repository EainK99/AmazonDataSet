I love this speaker. It is a much higher quality speaker than the various highly rated wireless portable speakers I have or have listen to.  It has a very nice sound, even at a low volume, which is very important to me.  Many speakers sound good only if you crank up the volume.  The bass, mid range and highs of the Woburn are true if not increased or decreased using available adjustment knobs. The three built-in amps (a separate amp for the woofer and each tweeter) really contribute to the good sound quality regardless of the volume, and it can get very LOUD.  I have a fairly high end home audio system (well over $7,500).  The sound of the Woburn does not compare to a high end audio system, but for its price and portability the sound of the Woburn is remarkable.<br /><br />I use the Woburn with my iPad or iPhone/iWatch either wired (an attractive cable is included that plugs into the headphone jack) or wireless (via Bluetooth).  Using Bluetooth, I can select an album or song and control the volume remotely from my iPhone, iPad or iWatch.  I can also control the Woburn remotely from my iWatch if the speaker is pugged into my iPhone.<br /><br />The speaker is not designed to carry around while using it.  It must be plugged into an outlet to work, and is heavy for its size because of the three amps. Although it is not at all a portable speaker in that sense, it can easily be moved from one location to another.  I bought the speaker in white (actually it is a very nice cream color).  The exterior is covered with a feaux leather, which is very attractive.  I highly recommend this product without hesitation.
