I know professional audio cables have to be of a certain quality to bring your professional studio equipment to the pinnacle of operation, so I was quite skeptical when I saw the price of these cables. I bought a DB25 8 channel cable previous to this brand (that was almost 3 times the price) because I needed a cable with DB25 connection at both ends. I have to say,I cannot tell the difference between the two. I have an Orion 32 (an already clean 32-ch converter) and with the Planet Wave cables, I get super clean audio. I haven't had any pops, clicks, or hum to date. I was so impressed, I bought additional cables to reconfigure my studio to include outboard gear. The great thing is these cables are modular. I'm amazed at the build quality of these cables too. Not to say that the cable I have that was 3 times the price was not good, but for some reason, I feel like the build quality of the Planet Wave cables was just as professional. I'm very satisfied with these cables, especially for the price.
