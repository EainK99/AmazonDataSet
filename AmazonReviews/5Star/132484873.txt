Perfect to prevent damage from abrasion. I use these on my kick drum. Work great. The other day I was looking at another abrasion problem, and I bought these to protect a foldout camper tent wall where the hinge rubs against the tight fabric. Works great! Who ever thought a drummer could be so clever, eh? :-)
