We ordered this for our 13 year old it is her second year  playing the cello . Some of the reviews were negative on this product. I highly disagree with them. I think some of those people are cello snobs. We took it to get set up at music store owner said it is a great beginner cello for kids. It sounds great and our daughter loves it. She has gotten lots of compliments on it sound and looks. We put on high quality strings and they set up bridge and loosened the pegs. Which you would do on any brand new beginner cello. We bought a second one for our 7 year old son who also plays.
