PYLE-PRO w/o question delivered! Flawless connectivity, well made, just the right length of cable. I'm using it to connect linear interface with mixing board for live recording of drums... no problem! Not that looks determines efficiency, when connected has that &#34;pro audio&#34; look! And, the price point was unheard of! I will no doubt continue to look to Amazon for my audio concerns!
