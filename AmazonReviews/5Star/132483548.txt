These lights worked very well for my application. They came packaged well, which had clear instructions on use. The packaging was also clear that these lights are for indoor use and are not water proof. I was able to cut and attach wire to these lights as I needed very easily. The 3M sticky tape on the back side of this light strip is extremely sticky and should hold up well. I am not sure how well it would do in freezing temperatures such as in a vehicle in winter time but for indoor applications, I don't see them coming down. I would buy these again.
