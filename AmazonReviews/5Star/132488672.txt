I just added this Behringer Bass Overdrive pedal to my board and I really love it.  It adds that little extra punch that I really like and I have found that I rarely turn it off while I'm playing.  I play hard rock and metal and this little pedal really caters to that heavier sound.  Aside from the plastic case the construction seems solid and the controls are nice and smooth and really allow a wide range of sound control.  I love the size of this since I have limited space on my pedal board.  If it holds up this will be a steal for the price.<br /><br />I will definitely try other Behringer pedals in the future based on the performance so far of this one.
