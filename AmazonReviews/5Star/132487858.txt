Lots of people more experienced with buying guitars have made more technical and detailed reviews of the Yamaha F325 guitar but I just want to add how much I personally LOVE my Yamaha! The sound is so clear, rich, and deep and even for a brand new guitar it held up its tuning relatively well for the conditions I put it in! I adore the folk-like timbre and it's a gorgeous instrument. At first the guitar felt bulky and uncomfortable to hold but after a few weeks in my guitar class at school it suddenly fit my body perfectly. Don't know why or how, but I know I don't plan on buying a replacement for Daenerys (my guitar) any time soon.
