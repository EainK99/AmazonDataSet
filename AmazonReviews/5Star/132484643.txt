its an amazing tool for vocalists but it takes a lot of time to learn how to use it .. I would suggest watching the tutorials on tc-helicon's youtube channel cause they've helped me A LOT.. so if you got time to watch videos & ready to learn then Its perfect.. other than that I think it has so so many effects which gives you the freedom to choose & create your own style..
