Quite possibly one of the best purchases this musician ever made, aside from the instrument of course.  I'm 4'11&#34;.  A trumpet-player friend has one of these chairs and highly recommended it; he let me borrow it one rehearsal, and I was sold.  $200 for a chair is crazy.  But it's totally worth it.<br /><br />I collapse the legs to their second lowest setting, and twist the feet to adjust for any non-level floor.  My feet can actually touch the floor now.  My back is actually supported now; the front of the chair doesn't &#34;dig&#34; into my knees/calves.  I can't remember EVER being comfortable while sitting to play; I have always just endured.  Hear me, all you shorties, and people who must sit a certain way while playing (I'm talking to you, cellists and bassoonists!).  The chair height is extraordinarily adjustable (My 6'3&#34; students use it too), but the platform is small.  The part you sit on is only 16&#34; deep; 17&#34; wide in the front tapering to 15&#34; wide in the back.  It's good for me, and I think it was intended for cellists who prefer to sit more angled down (all four legs adjust independently--they remind me of tent poles).  For tall bassoonists, the seat strap may pose a problem with the small platform.  You need the strap to be adjusted far enough from your hip so that the bocal angle is correct, and so that your wrists/arms/elbows aren't bent at an odd angle.  If you have long femurs, your ideal seat strap placement might be off the chair.  If you have a lot of girth, you may uncomfortably spill off the sides of this fairly narrow chair--again, an issue with the seat strap.  They make other chairs--if you're tall and/or wide and you have issues with standard orchestra chairs, just check their website for other offerings.<br /><br />Speaking as a short-stature bassoonist, I can't tell you what a wonderful difference this chair has made in my orchestra experience.  You'll be shocked if you've never realized how much tension you hold in your legs when you can't REST your feet on the floor.<br /><br />The only con, aside from price, is the weight.  This is heavy.  Lugging it to rehearsals (in addition to instrument and whatever paraphernalia) is a royal pain.  I've replaced the back two leg feet with casters to wheel the folded chair around.  This is a bit unwieldy, so I've taken to just putting it on a dolly along with my instrument.  Neither solution is ideal, but until I can convince every group I play with to provide me with one of these chairs, I'll just keep bringing my own.  It's worth it.legs when you can't REST your feet on the floor.<br /><br />The only con, aside from price, is the weight.  This is heavy.
