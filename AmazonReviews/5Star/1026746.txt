Pleasantly surprised with these pickups. They are wax dipped and have awesome tone for such an inexpensive pickup. I will probably purchase again. They are engraved HMV brand which I have never heard of before but they are decent sounding and come with all related hardware. That includes the pickup rings. I received a good set that's all I can say. If I remember correctly they were awhile getting here but like I say the quality is great for the price. I feel they have a classic humbucker tone , excellent clean tone and also capable of getting pretty nasty yet articulate.
