The first thing I noticed about this guitar was the color. It was awesome!!!! I was impressed how it darkened as it went to the sides.  Just try to put it somewhere where it won't get bumped.<br /><br />When I first played it, it was a little out of tune.  But I bought a tuner to go with it.  After I learned a few songs I had finally got used to the size, because I had a smaller guitar before.<br /><br />Before I got this guitar I had used an Ibanez.  I liked how the Indiana didn't get untuned half as fast as the Ibanez.  Also the Indiana sounded really nice and the strings arent as thin so they didn't break.  When i used it the first time it was a little awkward to hold but that's all<br /><br />The main reason I got this guitar was because my old one was getting too small to use.  The only bad thing about it is it dents up pretty easily.<br /><br />Overall this is the most amazing guitar I have ever used ( and i have used a lot)
