I was looking for a set of strings which was easier to play than a normal tension string and decided to switch to a light tension string.What I found after playing these string for a week, a week after they settled in, was that they provided excellent tone which is very crisp and clean. I also found that I had better control over this set of strings than normal tension strings. I am better able to push and pull notes with my right hand, my picking hand, and landing my left hand on the fret board is also somewhat easier. All in all, I am very pleased with the sound and feel of these strings and after trying out several other strings will be using these strings exclusively.
