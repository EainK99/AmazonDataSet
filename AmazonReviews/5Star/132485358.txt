The last version of Cubase I used was Cubase 5, which I was using at a university. I loved the interface, but I didn't like the instability and lost a lot of work when trying to simply modify a single parameter. I'm happy to report that Cubase 7 Artist edition is a much more reasonably priced yet extremely powerful tool, easily comparable to Logic Pro and other DAW software out there. I use it for both recording and MIDI and find it very powerful at both. However, if you're going to get the most out of Cubase, you're going to need to familiarize yourself with the software.<br /><br />Also, and this is very important, it comes with the required USB dongle. Do not order another one! I made this mistake and ended up with an extra dongle I can't use or even return.
