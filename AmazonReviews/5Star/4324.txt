I am always looking for a way to simplify my rig and make a load in and load out easier and lighter. This stand helps that greatly, by replacing the unwieldy,tangly guitar stands that most folks use. Two of them fit nicely in my gig bag.<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical, but the rubber back pad and pads on the legs hold my guitars very securely.<br /><br />They hold standard guitars very well, but they do not hold odd shaped guitars. I have an Explorer that the stand will not hold. V-shaped guitars will not work either.
