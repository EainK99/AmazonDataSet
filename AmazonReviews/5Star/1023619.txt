I have a Resonator Banjo with a tone ring (Deering Goodtime Special) which I am using to learn the Scruggs style of picking.  I have decided that I will also take up the Clawhammer method of picking which is popularized in my region of the country (Southwest Virginia).<br /><br />After reading the previous review, I was excited to try this particular model.  The banjo is well constructed for an import.  The head is a Mylar type of cover.  The yellow color of the head is close to natural maple.  The neck is finished with a rosewood fretboard.  The edges are done in a tortoise colored plastic or Formica. There is a steel tone ring which adds to the richness of sound.<br /><br />One minor issue was that when I received mine, the bridge was not set up.  I had to loosen the strings to fit the bridge.  Mind you, that I purchased an open box special and whoever used it did not properly set it up.  There were more grooves than what were needed so I didn't hold this against my own rating.  However, regardless of that fact, the bridge is very low quality.  I installed a Golden Gate GB-3 Deluxe and it made a world of difference for maintaining the tuning.  I have considered upgrading the strings but I will hold off until I break the current ones in to see how they perform.<br /><br />The action is good and doesn't require a great deal of effort to play a chord.  The strings are much closer together than my Resonator Style Banjo.  The configuration is more suited to Clawhammer over picking with a Scruggs style approach.  With respect to sound, the volume is lower than a resonator style.  The pitch is a little higher, and the tone is brighter/higher.<br /><br />The very light weight makes it great for a traveling banjo.  This would work great for a youngster or beginner.  Overall, I am pleased with my purchase apart from a minor issue with the bridge.<br /><br />For the price it is hard to beat.  Another similar model to try would be the Recording 1930s style banjo, or you can go up to the Deering Goodtime (Open Back) which is much more money.much more money.
