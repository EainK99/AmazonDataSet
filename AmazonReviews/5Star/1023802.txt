This drum is excellent. It has a great attack to it and a lot of &#34;pop.&#34; It's versatile and can be used in any style of music. However, it's best applied to ska, reggae, Latin, and jazz. If you use a lot of rim shots you will love this drum! Also, the price cannot be beat for the value of the instrument.<br /><br />Suggestion: Use a Remo Ambassador with this drum.<br /><br />WARNING: Don't tune too tightly!! It's tempting since it's such a highly pitched drum, but tuning it too high is bad for the drum (and the head).
