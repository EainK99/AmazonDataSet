I play blues and use lots of slides & growls.  I need to be able to play soft in the low register and I have to be able to howl in the upper register.  I can get to G in the altissimo, but with a 2 1/2 I don't have the power i have a few notes lower.  Always compromises.  Generally i don't do any sanding or other reed prep.  When a reed seems hard to play, stuffy or dead, I toss it and take out a new one. A decade ago 8 out of 10 Vandorens were fine. That stopped, and I got one box where I spent time sanding every reed in the box and only one reed ended up good enough to use.  I tried several new-to-me brands including the Vandoren V12s and settled on the Marca 2 1/2.  Probably the Marca 2 1/2 is slightly softer than a Vandoren 2 1/2, but not enough softer to change my play.<br /><br />I have liked the Vandoren Java Reds for my tenor sax.  I wonder if they every will come out with a comparable clarinet reed.  I have not tried the german cut & black label -- I think those are newer.<br /><br />But save those nice plastic reed guards you get with the Vandorens.  Those are handy.
