As an audiophile I would highly recommend these headphones over any other in the same price point. They have crisp clear highs, solid band very detailed mids and the bass isn't extremely hard but it is very tight clear and strong. Even using an equalizer from your smartphone with these headphones you could get them to sound exactly how you would want them. The looks and build quality is by far the best over any other in this price point such as the sennheiser equivalent however the sennheiser headsets tend to benefit more from DAC's and headphone amplifier's. Trying to say this as simply as I can for the average consumer, these headphones are the best out there at this price, nothing could beat them overall and the build is strong and sturdy with little risk of breaking if dropped by accident.
