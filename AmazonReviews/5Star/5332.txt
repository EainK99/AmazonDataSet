ToneRite really made a difference in quickly breaking in my new Martin Dreadnought Junior.  The sound is fuller and sweeter and rings out longer now.  I'm a believer!  I also use it on my Martin DCPA4.  It's not as big a change because it is several years older, but it helped.<br /><br />Some people even put it on their electric guitars but I don't understand the benefit.  I haven't tried it yet.  Maybe I will try ToneRite on my Gibson Les Paul next.
