I have only had these for two days. Also I am not an audiophile. I have not really listened to music for about 15 years. Now the review. Spent most of day one running white noise through it as suggested through a lot of the reviews. Still in the breaking in period. Listening to my old play list and hearing instruments and vocals I have never heard before. Alanis Morrisettes &#34;All I really want&#34; is one example. I can hear her talking in the background saying the chorus while the track has her singing it. Some people may not like that but I for one feel that this is what the music sounded like originally. Absolutely amazing. I bought some Beats Solo before this. I thought that would be a premium sound. Oh how I was wrong. This is night and day compared to that. I will update this post if something changes or if the headphones get better. Other reviews stated that these get better the more you use them.
