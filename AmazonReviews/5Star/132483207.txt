After spending hours looking at Amazon and other websites, I selected the OU5T combination.  This is not only a great looking, well made, and sounding Uke, but the case and tuner are a plus.  Later, I have found that &#34;Ukulele Mike&#34; also like Oscar Schmidt Uke's and suggests the OU5 as a nice Uke for a serious beginner.  I have a soprano Uke and it is too small for my hands.  The tenor is an excellent size.  Got interested in Uke on a Hawaiian cruise where they had Uke lessons and I was hooked.  Going on another South Pacific cruise where lessons will be given so I am really prepared with this excellent instrument.  The OU5T is expertly crafted and I love the pearl inlays.  The gold plated Grover Tuners are a real plus.  This is a &#34;plywood&#34; constructed instrument which will serve me well in my travels.  Time has been spent in the details, not only on the outside, but the inside.  For the price, you will be well pleased.  If you are a professional, as I am not, than this may not be the instrument for you.  I am basing this review on knowing what makes up a good guitar which applies to Uke.  Take a close look at all the Uke's and you will find that this has the most bang for the buck.  In the future, I will upgrade the hard case.
