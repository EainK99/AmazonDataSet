Needed pick-up for my F5 mandolin to solve feedback problems. Reluctantly bought what I figured would be a $30 POS because somebody told me to and it would more than pay for itself in one night. I was mind blown. It won't replace and expensive Schertler but at thirty bucks every working musician should have at least one of these around. Very stable and functional and it sounds pretty damn good.
