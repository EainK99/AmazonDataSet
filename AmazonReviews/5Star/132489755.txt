Glad I picked up this case, I really like it.  I'm an adult beginner and the case I had for my violin made me feel, well childish.  I wanted something that would protect my violin well and make me feel proud to cary around.  This thing looks very classy inside and out.  I really like to olive interior, the brass gauges and the size.  I wanted a place for a humidifier, a couple of different mutes, shoulder rest, rosin, extra strings, peg drops, a rag and a few thin books.  It all fits perfectly!  It's very light and quite beautiful inside.  The temp and humidity gauges are a classy and a helpful touch as my violin is very old and the humidifier really helps keep the violin in tune between practice sessions.
