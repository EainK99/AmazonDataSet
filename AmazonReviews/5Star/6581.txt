ADDICTION ALERT! This ukulele is highly addictive. I just received it, and I can't put it down. It looks so cute, and sounds so sweet and mellow. For all of you, guitar players, there are nuances that you will need to adjust to. It's very small and it takes some time to learn to hold it properly so it won't slide. It's definitely not for the male's fingers (I got soprano). It has 4 strings that you will need to tune to AECG. All the chords are different from the guitar chords, but very easy to re-learn. I'm using my regular guitar pick. I played for about 2 hours after the initial tuning, and it seems to stay in tune.<br />All in love, I love to make this birdie sing and I will be enjoying doing so on my trip to Europe!!! Perfect for travel!
