I use this for scratching.  As stated previously, this is the iconic DJ cartridge.  It tracks perfectly and has never skipped for me.  For scratching, I recommend angling it along the plane of the axis of the tone arm's rotation (not perpendicular to the record's groove).  This further reduces the possibility of skipping.
