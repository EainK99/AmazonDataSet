A &#34;band&#34; sax is issued with a nylon strap that is thin, hard & rough on the neck.  We were very surprised to find this strap at 1/2 the cost of our local music store, decided to give it a try.  HE WAS SO THRILLED to open the box and find this really nice, well-padded and adjustable strap (which would work for both alto & tenor sax, we were informed).  Highly recommend both the product and the seller, which was also prompt, efficient & very courteous in their responses.  I will definitely look for all our music supplies through this seller, and highly recommend this saxophone strap to new band members.
