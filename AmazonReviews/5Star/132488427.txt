The 920d Custom Shop built the guitar that I wanted to build, but managed to build it cheaper than I could, only including the parts, not even taking into account the inevitable frustration that would have ensued had I attempted the build. If you don't like EMG pickups, choose one of their many other Strats with any pickup options that you want. The setup on this Strat is the very best, I couldn't have asked for any thing else. $749 for this professional grade axe? Still smiling about this buy.
