First of all keep in mind these picks are green (if it matters).  I ordered these picks because I have been using black raven .80mm and I would shred through them.  I just got these picks about 2 minutes ago and I already love them.  They feel alot more durable and you can grip them easier than the black ravens.  Also the extra .08 mm makes a difference.  I prefer a thicker pick when tremolo picking. I still get a nice glide over my strings for strumming but it is still stiff enough to keep control and consistently tremolo pick.  I will never use anything other that Clayton picks, and no matter which pick you choose you will love it if it has the Clayton logo on it.
