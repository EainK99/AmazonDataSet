I've always been a little scared of using an electric tuner, but this changed my mind. It attaches to the headstock of your guitar and uses the vibrations to tune the guitar perfectly. This was a godsend in class because i could tune my guitar while others struggled with their tuners picking up background noise. Easy to read, easy to use, and I've never sounded better
