These 4 Chip LED Module White 12V (Pack of 20)<br />Great LED lights, Easy to install. Using under a cabinet to add some lighting.  Runs off of my battery bank.  They look great and give a nice warm glow under the cabinet.  I need to order more so I can do my kitchen too.  LED lighting uses less electric, it also last much longer that CFL or standard light bulbs. Perfect for solar becuase they run off of 12V.  Super excited. I give 5 Stars!  I received the 4 Chip LED Module White 12V lighting at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
