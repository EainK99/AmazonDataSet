I use this tuner to monitor our signal at a micro-power elementary school radio station. It is sensitive, selective and provides plenty of output to drive powered speakers. I appreciate that this bargain-priced unit comes complete with a remote, antenna and all the wires needed for installation. It is also an attractive unit with appealing lighting.
