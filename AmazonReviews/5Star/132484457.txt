Great sound, good for music, movies, games, etc.<br /><br />Not very portable, I basically leave them at my desk and use them with my computer, the long cord is difficult to manage if you want to use them on the go, but is fine for use with a computer.<br /><br />The only other high end headphones I can compare them to are &#34;Beats&#34; and these, while less portable, sound as good if not better than those (the Beats tend to have over-amplified bass in my opinion).<br /><br />If you want to buy a pair of headphones, and don't want to spend $150+ these are an awesome value.
