This stand went to music camp with two of my children this year (ages 13 and 14). They liked that it was good and sturdy, and that it had a carrying case with an ample strap for slinging over a shoulder or attaching to their backpacks or cases. It's a little more involved in setup/takedown, though, so on a few occasions (when rehearsals let out late and they had to scramble across campus to get to another rehearsal on time) they were frustrated that they couldn't just &#34;fold it down and go,&#34; as one does with the standard silver collapsible music stand. All things considered, though, they thought this purchase was a good one and look forward to using it for many years.
