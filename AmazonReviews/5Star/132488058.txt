I was hesitant to buy this case from reading the reviews.  But this is a great case.  I prefer a full zipper versus clasps.  There is no chance of the case opening and the horn fall out.  My other case has 3 latches.  The case will protect your horn.  It is solid.  I am not talking about putting on a plane, but for gigging, it will work great.  I bought it for a Armstrong bari, which fits great, but it also will hold my Keilwerth SX-90.  I like the case so much that I swapped the Keilwerth to it. I have a pro-tec for my tenor.  I have used it for about 15 years,  the strap lost a rivet, so I put a screw in the case and it works fine.  I am more than pleased with the purchase.  It is a solid case and a great value for the money.
