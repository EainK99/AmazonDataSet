I got one of these a few years ago, the model hasn't changed, and why should it. it is just fantastic.  Never had a problem, well the remote is confusing to use, I just run it full tilt the entire time anyway, so I don't really need all the fancy remote options.<br /><br />just keep it clean and it will last you a long time.<br /><br />Also, if you buy it, remember you just got a \\"Real\\" fog machine, so spend a few extra bucks and order your fog juice online, don't get it at a local big box store.  The 2 extra dollars you spend will be well worth it. you wouldn't put 87 octane in a sports car now would you?
