I was actually interested in buying something under $200. The deal seemed pretty good to me. So went with that. I got the guitar and it sounds really good. Along with the Yamaha FD01S it comes with a very nice digital electronic tuner, Gig bag, pics, extra strings, strap and an instructional DVD and with no shipping charges.<br /><br />One thing that I do notice is everyday when I play I see the tuning has changed a little bit. I see a variation of around +-20 decibels every other day. However, it could be because of room temperature variations or because of playing itself, so can't complain. I don't mind turning the knobs a little bit to re-tune it.
