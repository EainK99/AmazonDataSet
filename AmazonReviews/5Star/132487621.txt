This thing is all you need to improve your sound, even a cheap bass will sound as a beast after it meets this pedal. This is the first pedal I bought and I'm glad I did. There are a lot of settings and uses for it.<br />If you play blues or reggae you can get deep and strong sounds by lowering the mids and you will love this thing. There are some special settings if you are into slapping and such.<br /><br />I study a little bit of sound theory and this pedal works awesome to create a natural distortion, just increase the mids and level knobs all the way and put all the gain in your amp, it will create a nice tone special for metal, crust and alternative music that need a violent bass. Just be careful and keep a low volume if your amp is not that strong you can damage it!<br /><br />Best thing ever. Period
