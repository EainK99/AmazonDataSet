With a beautiful rich crimson shine, and a smooth (yet powerful) tone, this instrument can just shout quality. At first, I was a tad worried, considering I didn't know what to expect, \\"Is it going to feel weird to hold?\\" \\"Is it going to be durable?\\" \\"How well is the mouthpiece sculpted?\\" and after trying it out for a few minutes, I just knew it was worth the wait, and every penny I put into it. Would highly recommend this to anyone who likes to travel. Word of warning, carry some form of bag with you! It doesn't weigh a lot, but it will take up a bit of space. On a final note, I have never been more sure about giving 5 stars. 100% satisfaction.
