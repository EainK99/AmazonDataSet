This was an impulse buy for me.  I got it at a store where I was browsing to kill some time between appointments. I paid more than I would have had I bought it at Amazon.<br /><br />That said, I got home, plugged it in and wow.  The entire room was swarming with color.  This little box lights up a room like nothing else in green and red geometric patterns.  You can change the speed from still to fast, set it to follow music (it has a built in microphone) or set it to strobe on and off.<br /><br />The larger the room the better! The projector is extremely bright for its size and price.<br /><br />The only downside is that the cooling fan (built in) is a bit louder than I'd like it to be but not so much that I'd take away a star in my rating. All and all I'll give it a rating of &#34;too cool for school&#34;.
