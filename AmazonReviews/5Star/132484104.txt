I've had my share of overdrives.  all the good ones I won't list and all the obvious ones you know about.  I've spend way too much money on pedals.<br /><br />This is a secret weapon overdrive.  Nobody knows about Joyo and I never advertise it.  This is by FAR one of the best OD's I have ever played.  I play 3 church services a week, plus rehearsals and use numerous configurations of Tele, Strats, gretsch, hollowbodies and this little sucker has amazing fat tones for ALL of them, both singles and humbuckers alike.<br /><br />I initially wanted an EQ pedal that I can adjust on my board because my amp is in another room when I play live and we use In ear monitors (go 1964 ears!!  woo hoo!)  I found this pedal to be very versatile for all types of guitars.<br /><br />I've used Fender tube Amps, Egnator, Vox tube, Orange amps and even some solid states.  Works well with pedals.<br /><br />My general setup (regardless of amp), is setting my amp (in another iso room) to the point of just before tube breakup, all EQ's set to 12:00 (even) and enough power volume for pluckiness punch (so you can hear the tubes working for you!).<br /><br />On my pedalboard, depending on the guitar, I set my gain for the right breakup for me, the volume for the best digital board volume for in ears.  Here come the REAL adjustments:<br /><br />Everything depends on that middle EQ and the &#34;VOICE&#34; knob.  for Single Coils, I roll the mids up to about 2 o'clock.<br />I roll the trebs back just a HAIR and the bass is still at 12.<br /><br />The VOICE knob is MOST important.  If you roll the voice all the way to the right at about 5 o'clock, you get this FAT FAT American Grunge sound.  Super FAT!  if you roll the voice back the other direction to 7 o'clock, you get this Orange amp/Vox amp boxy crunchy sound.  Somewhere in between you can find a Marshall sound and a Mesa sound (for these you have to mess with the EQs a little more for that &#34;chunk chunk&#34; growl.<br /><br />For use with Humbuckers, you can play around with the mids EQ knob and the voice knob a little.<br /><br />It is a very dynamic pedal so try to make super minimal adjustments.  If you can't find your sound, set everything back to 12 o'clock and start over.  I have a friend that made too many adjustments on both the amp and pedal and he managed to sound pretty thin.  After setting everything to 12noon (zero-ing it out you could say) on both the amp EQ and the pedal, he found the sound he needed pretty quick. He was surprised that he needed very little adjusting.<br /><br />The AC TONE Pedal is accurate and doesn't seem to suck tone. I like it a ton.  I use a modified Boss Blues Driver after this as a slight boost for solos.  works well with delays and reverbs and tremolos too.  excellent pedal and highly recommended. I still can't believe the price tag.  I feel like I overpaid for my other pedals!  (although my Strymon Blue Sky reverb was worth every penny)<br />Get this pedal!Humbuckers, you can play around with the mids EQ knob and the voice knob a little.<br /><br />It is a very dynamic pedal so try to make super minimal adjustments.
