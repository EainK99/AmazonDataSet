A simple clean boost pedal that does exactly what you want it to. The Spark Mini has a wide range of usable volume (from a slight bump to stand out in the mix) to a pretty intense 20 db CLEAN boost which is rare. I am mainly a clean player but I've also begun using this to boost my overdrives and distortions, and this pedal works wonderfully for both applications. The full size Spark has a more tone-shaping flexibility but I've found that I prefer single knob boost pedals (like the MXR Micro Amp) for ease of use and transparency.
