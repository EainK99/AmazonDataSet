As far as I'm concerned, it should be illegal to sell those amber bricks of rosin to violin players! My son has been playing for 3 years, he applied Jade rosin, played, and we both stared at each other stunned. The sound was so pure, round and effortless, it literally just increased his ability and talent, he couldn't stop playing and saying, &#34;LIsten to THIS!&#34; Who knew. Now you do. Do not even give it a second thought, this rosin is a game changer.
