I had been looking to replace a simple digital recorder that I used for recording rehearsals for choir. The Roland was a little bigger than its predecessor. The quality of the musical voice recordings was excellent. My voice sounded much fuller and round. The ability to record in multiple formats saved me the time to convert the files. I can rehearse much more effectively.
