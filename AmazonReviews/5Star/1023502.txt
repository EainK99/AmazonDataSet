This brought my clarinet back to life without spending very much at all.  The pamphlet and video tutorial were extremely helpful.  Cork replacement takes a bit of patience for a first-timer, but worked out great.  It is a basic process, but care is required to dice the cork to size and not spill cement on undesired parts of your instrument.  The material supplied would serve several more cork replacement jobs than for just the four cork strips included - so the next time you need to re-cork your clarinet all you need is more cork.<br /><br />*** As a warning, if using pliers be very careful when pressing down on the cork after completely installed.  Although he emphasized to press lightly, I still almost cracked my wooden clarinet at the sleeve by clamping pliers too hard against the cork.
