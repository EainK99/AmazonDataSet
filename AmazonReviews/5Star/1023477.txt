This thing is absolutely amazing.  It breathed new life into my 6505+.  I was using BOSS pedals before.  I always have, since I first started playing guitar.  It took a lot for me to want to switch to a multi-effects pedal.  I went for it and was pleasantly surprised.  It turned out to be a fantastic move, and here is why.<br /><br />I've seen a handful of reviews where people have talked bad about this thing, and it doesn't make any sense.  They have no idea what they are talking about.  This pedal is extremely diverse.  It can do so many different things, and be good in so many different situations.<br /><br />The first situation is recording at home.  The sound you can get with the amp modeling is amazing.  all you need to do is install the driver, and plug the GT-100 into your computer with a USB cable, and you can record with amazing quality right into any recording software.  I use Reaper, and it's flawless.  It's really been a great asset for pre-production while my band is writing material for our new album.  Also, in this same exact way.  You can plug it directly into a P/A system, and it will sound great.<br /><br />As for my amp, my set up is different.  I turned off the amp modeling, and I use the 4 cable method.  If you don't know what it is, then go to youtube and search for the 4 cable method and find Glenn DeLaune's video.  The 4 cable method allows me to use the true sound of my amp, while the GT-100 equalizes it out.  The 6505+ is a noisy amp.  The clean channel sucks, the rhythm channel is weak, and the lead channel can be a bit muddy on it's own.  Thanks to the fact that I can make patches.  I was able to get a great clean tone on my clean channel, and I was able to fix the muddy sound on my lead channel.  So I use the lead channel for my rhythms, and then with another patch I boost it for my solos.  It sounds great, and so much more clear.  I'm still tweaking it here and there, which is normal, but I love how it sounds.  Though as of right now I'm about to pick up a new amp, one that is more high end than the Peavey 6505+.  I'm confident this pedal will shine through still.<br /><br />Now, this pedal is really sturdy.  It feels like it can take a beating.<br /><br />As for the software.  There has been an upgrade sometime this year.  I have had no problem with the software.  It's really easy to use.  It's not that hard to figure out the menus.  It takes a little bit of learning, but it's not a problem.<br /><br />Also for advice.  If you want to get the best sound out of this pedal for your amp.  Learn what pedals and effects should go before the amp, and which effects should go through the effects loop.  It will help you get a better sound by far if you are using the 4 cable method which I highly recommend if your amp has an effects loop.'m about to pick up a new amp, one that is more high end than the Peavey 6505+.
