This is a really nice beginning ukelele with a fair amount of nice goodies to go along with it.  The case is the biggest bargain of all; you'd probably pay as much as the entire package to buy this case separately for any other uke.  The strings aren't too bad although I am going to replace them all with Aquila strings to see if I can keep the tuning a little better.  Nice sound, good quality tuning pegs (the kind with gears to keep the tension) and the electronic tuner is a nice bonus.  I'm looking forward to getting a lot of mileage out of this instrument.
