Not only does this Super Reverb look great (Burgundy & Wheat) but, also sounds Killer! My 58 Les Paul RI sounds awesome through this amp. Tons of fat tone. Plug in my JB Strat and I'm floored. Just tons and tons of tone from this amp. The Celestion G10 Greenbacks (4 of 'em) roar and clean up nicely. Glad Fender decided to make these again. Best amp in the Fender line up in IMHO. It has awesome reverb and tremolo. Takes pedals very well. Get yourself one, you won't regret it.
