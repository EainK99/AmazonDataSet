My friend and I purchased this laser light projector for parties in my college dorm. It is absolutely perfect. We love it so much, the lights look so cool, and our friends come from all over campus just to see them and party with us. People from all over the building have been complimenting us, telling us that we made the &#34;best purchase ever&#34;. If you're looking for a great way to boost a dorm party, this is the perfect size for you and it works awesome. Doesn't need batteries either, which made our lives easier. Great price for the value. Would highly, highly recommend.
