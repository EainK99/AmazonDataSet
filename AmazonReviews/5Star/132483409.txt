I was skeptical about this screw-down capo thinking how inconvenient it would be to take on and off my guitar on stage.  However, it can be placed easily and securely on the nut and ready for an instant key change.  I was pleased that it did not depress my strings like the spring-loaded capos I have used for years.  There is less sound distortion and tuning adjustment with this capo.  I use it all the time and keep the old clip-ons for backup just on the odd chance that I lose this one.  It is solidly constructed, lighter in weight and will last for many years to come unlike the spring-loaded devices that keep breaking on me after a few months.  If you buy it and use it a short while, you will not go back to your old capo spring-loaded or rubber band capo again.  Why have I not bought a second for a backup?  This thing was built to last a lifetime.
