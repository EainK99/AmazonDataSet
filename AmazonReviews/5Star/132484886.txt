I have gone through many headphones over the years, having a 20+ year old set of AKG 240DF headphones for high quality (pinkie in the air) listening.  Love those, but wish to keep them from being destroyed while packed with a laptop bag.  I tried a couple of low price($25) Philips headphones, which had a good sound, but were definitely not sturdy enough for travel (with children, especially), breaking at a plastic swivel connection (not the smartest design, I must add).  To be fair to Philips, I did find another pair for my children to use and they have held up well thus far.<br /><br />These AKGs sound good, especially for the cost and appear well made.  I will not say they sound as good as my reference AKG headphones, but certainly sound fine when attached to a laptop or tablet for mp3 or video watching.  I am not a fan of heavy bass and these certainly seem to have a nice flat sound to me, which I find a good thing.  They look and feel sturdy enough for the mostly plastic construction (hopefully not a plastic swivel point) and are comfortable on my big head for a two hour movie.  They do have closed ear cups, so be prepared for some moisture buildup if you perspire a lot.<br /><br />The AKGs come with a mini phono plug, which is perfect for modern headphone ports, but also pack an adapter for the large size plugs of old type equipment.  Definitely recommended.
