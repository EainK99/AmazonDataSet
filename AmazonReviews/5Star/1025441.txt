I bought mine elsewhere at a nice discount but I just wanted to say I use this with a Mesa Boogie Mark V 25 head and it sounds awesome Great bass response as well as mids and highs. The MK  II sound selector on the amp in overdrive is smooth with no breakup Great little cabinet and I plan on buying another one. I found that adding casters from Amazon is a great choice also Rock On
