I've been a bass player for 45 years, and this is one of the finest drivers I've ever used.<br /><br />I ran across some interesting information on the Talkbass forum about a speaker design known as the Greenboy fEARful 15-sub.<br />It is a design specifically tailored to this driver, and has been built by many with very satisfactory results.<br />Since I'm getting older, the light weight (45 lbs) and small size (20\\" x 24\\" x 16\\") appealed to me, so I built a fEARful cabinet and put one of these monsters in there.<br /><br />Using a Fender P-Bass through a GK 1001RB amp, it has deep lows, quick response and amazing punch. Very efficient but with huge power handling and long excursion.<br />Only disadvantage is it rolls off quick above about 1400 hz, so if you're a bass player that likes pops and snap, match it with a 6\\" mid or a horn. There are other fEARful designs that do that.<br /><br />I hooked it up as a sub on the home theater and even though it's not in an optimal sub cabinet, with proper EQ'ing it still hit concussive levels without breaking a sweat. (enough to make the cat throw up during \\"Armageddon\\").<br /><br />There are many different designs on the web for this driver for specific applications, a real testimony to it's performance.<br />Best choice I could have made. Now I can get rid of my old 4-10\\" and 2-15\\" boat anchors.<br /><br />My back and my bass both love me now.
