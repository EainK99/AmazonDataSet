This is a great pick for playing the ultra-modern \\"digital\\" guitars.<br /><br />(I'm talking about either the Yamaha EZ-AG or the You Rock Guitar, which have metal string triggers instead of normal strings... I'm sure more of these digital guitars will come out as time progresses).<br /><br />I currently have a Yamaha EZ-AG... And I plan on getting a You Rock Pro guitar when it comes out.<br /><br />With these digital guitars, when I played with a normal pick, I would get an irritating clacking noise, because of the metal string triggers.<br /><br />Problem solved with these wonderful leather picks!
