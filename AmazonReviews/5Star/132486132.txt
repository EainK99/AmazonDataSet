Bought this amplifier a few weeks ago for a 12-year old playing an acoustic-electric guitar. The amp looks nice, is handy for practicing and sounds great with both acoustic and electric guitars. I have compared its 6 1/2\\" speaker with some 5\\" - 8\\" ones and let me tell you, this baby is no match. It blows them away big time -- both sound and power wise.<br /><br />The production date shows 2011 and so, it's been sitting on the shelf somewhere. But there is no buzz or hum and the options (gain, volume, boost, treble, mid, bass, phone) give you all you need from a practice amp producing a good, clear and crispy sound. I would not hesitate to use it on stage, too. I don't understand how people could miss this one.<br /><br />The only thing I am missing is some feature on the controls to indicate their relative left/right position. However, control reliability is more important than visual reference and I can compromise on that. The controls feel smooth and solid.<br /><br />Now I see the price is up by over $14.00 to $59.23, putting it next to Fender Frontman 10G that has the same features and a smaller speaker. However, I would not trade this amp for any other one I have tested including Frontman. If you see no update below, then the Archer GA-15 still rocks and the kid is happy with it.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />May 26, 2014<br /><br />Okay folks, the champs of this web design, apparently stuck in their little computer lab where they seem to suffer from oxygen deprivation and reality check, won't let me post this review directly because of my previous one (see above). So, I am doing it this way, hoping it will attract attention and help someone just like a straight review would. Unfortunately, the amplifier will neither get an accurate count of reviews nor any stars on the Amazon's scale of goodness that this product deserves, which is 5 stars. As it is in the Amazon world, you can keep buying the same product in tons, but you can say how good/bad it is only one time, even if you have new info to share. Go figure. Hard to say who's the champ and who's the chimp here, and how the buyer fits in their concept, i.e., the one who pays them for thinking and serving? Call this reversed marketing where the seller calls the shots; you supply the paycheck...<br /><br />Anyhow, if actions speak louder than words, then this amplifier is a perfect example of it. It speaks with awesome power and conviction I have not found in other models of this class. Of course, the back cover of this amplifier provides not only a greater total surface to resonate and amplify the sound, but makes the sound bounce and go to the open front. Some cheap amplifiers do not have the same sound quality mainly because of the back being open and the sound not coming out fully rich where you want to have it. Nobody needs to hear the blast in the back, do they?<br /><br />Given the drop in price down to $37.99, I just could not resist -- I bought anoth Archer. Do I need to say more? You don't get a bigger bang for a buck than this one gives you. Make no mistake, this is no replacement for the Archer GA-15 that I bought last year. That one still works and works well. This is more like sticking with the winning horse and getting more of the pleasure of winning.<br /><br />The only thing I still miss on this amplifier are dials to show their relative position. The ones used here are esthetic yet not ergonomic. But what the heck, you don't buy an amplifier to play with dials; you buy it to play a guitar, and this one certainly gives you a great pleasure to do so. You can always use a marker to put a dot/line on the dials to aid those in need of visual reference.<br /><br />One more comment to those complaining about getting a buzz from an amplifier. Please remember this before jumping to conclusions: (1) make sure you have a good quality cable that is not susceptible to electromagnetic waves; (2) keep the amplifier awayfrom other electronics and sources of interference, e.g., fluorescent lights, microwaves, appliances, etc. This includes any electric/acoustic-electric guitars plugged in, whether played or not. I have experienced no buzz with this amplifier playing an acoustic-electric guitar.<br /><br />Good luck, and have a blast!from other electronics and sources of interference, e.g., fluorescent lights, microwaves, appliances, etc. This includes any electric/acoustic-electric guitars plugged in, whether played or not.
