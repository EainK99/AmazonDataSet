The Numark Orbit is a device that sends commands to your programs and allows you to manipulate them through this hardware interface.  It is really meant to be used with professional tools like Serato DJ, Traktor Pro, Abelton Live, etc.  If you don't have any of those (and especially if you don't know what they are) then this device could serve as a toy, but you aren't going to get much use out of it.  Numark DOES provide you with software you can download for free and use this device with, but I'm having a hard time seeing what I'll ever do with it.  But then again, I'm not a DJ.  If I were a DJ and I had one of these professional tools, then I think I would love the Orbit.  It does put lots of functions at the tips of your fingers and since you can customize it to do pretty much whatever you want (within the limits of the program you are using) that means you are able to have all your favorite functions up front where you have easy access to them without the clutter of the other functions you don't use as much.  Although at first I thought the built in accelerometers were just hype and not for any serious use, I have to admit that they DO give a nice analog control factor and I decided I liked having them (although note that in the sample program, it looks like it only uses the forward/back one, not the side/side one).<br /><br />As a side note, I noticed the EULA for the software is, for the most part, pretty standard, but this caught my attention:<br />\\"10.3.  Software upgrades. If you have upgraded your software, you may not<br />about the software and the hardware devices you use in connection with the software in a manner that does not personally identify you.\\"  I have no idea what they are trying to say, but I sure hope they are respecting my privacy :)<br /><br />If you have one of these professional tools, then I think this would be a great addition to your set.  If you don't... hey, it could be a fun toy for a while, but unless you have a specific use in mind, that's all it's going to be.
