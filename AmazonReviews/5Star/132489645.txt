This little guy...wow. I play bass...I know guitarist what does a bassist need with pedals...But after purchasing this little guy because i needed just a slight boost when the bass needs to cut through just a touch more, hence the purchase. But it does so much more than boost your signal, it also gives you more head room, and putting this little guy just after my volume pedal but before anyother effect does amazing things. Its like the MXR micro amp, but in my view better than the micro amp. I had the micro amp and was satisfied for a time but just didnt match my sound, kind of dropped my bottom end out or at least thats the way it sounded to me. But replacing it with the EHX LPB1...it alters the sounds of other pedals...If you want it to...Keeping the dial at less than 9oclock gives me the boost i want...go to 1030-11 and get a clean overdrive (going to an ampeg tube amp) but activate other effects pedals and its amazing what the LPB does, auto whas are more pronouced, synth pedals carry tones better, chorus pedals cut through better, reverb is more.....reverby(sorry i just get passionate about my pedals is all)...it doesnt tak up to much room on the board (EHX nano) but has huge sound properties.<br /><br />Looking for boost, or just a way to change the sound of some of your favorite effects pedals...DO IT NANO STYLE<br /><br />Keep makin em EHX...Ill keep buyin em
