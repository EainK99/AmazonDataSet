I am using the Chauvet Stage Designer 50 for a medium size church. Works great for par cans and pin spots, that is what it is designed for. Do your home work first before buying a controller because there are three different types Par can, LED, and Intelligent lighting controllers. LED and intelligent controllers will allow you to use the full 512 channels to cover all the channels needed for lights that use several channels per light fixture. If you are on a small budget the Chauvet controllers are great, make sure you get one with enough channels to cover your needs plus a few more for the future. I will be adding LED lights next for the color lights on the stage and I plan on purchasing a Chauvet LED controller. If you want to find a controller that will do everything you will spend thousands of dollars. You might save some money if you buy a computer based controller. Have fun with your project and remember do your home work first.
