My Gibson SG fits very snugly and securely in this case.  The case is well-padded, so it can take some bumping around and I know my guitar is safe.  A covered compartment inside gives you space for accessories.  The case closes and snaps securely.  Easy to carry.<br /><br />The case feels solidly constructed.  It's not going to withstand being hit by a truck, but it take some pretty good knocking around and still the guitar safe.<br /><br />The only downside is figuring out how to position the guitar strap so that it all fits it in easily.
