This bag is padded and my granddaughters snare drum and drum stand fit very well. I was worried about whether or not the drum stand would fit because I had to order a taller than normal drum stand. Alas! the drum stand fit perfect. She carries her drum bag over her shoulder along with her back pack to school. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a snare drum and stand bag.
