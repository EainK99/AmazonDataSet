I received the item today, I bought it used from Amazon Wharehouse Deals. The instrument was in all the original packaging and has no damage or anything to it so I am completely shocked it was used. Plays incredibly, looks awesome, solid build, beautiful sound. The case is very nice with great wheels and tons of protection and storage. The instrument came with a mouthpiece, ligature, a cleaning cloth, a pair of white gloves, and a neckstrap with a metal hook that is very comfortable. I was hesitant at first since it had no reviews but since it as sold by Amazon I decided that with there return policy it was a great deal. I absolutely love it and can't wait to use it more and more for many years to come.
