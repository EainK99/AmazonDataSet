I ordered these to hang my daughter's ukelele, mandolin, electric guitar, 6 string acoustic guitar and 12 string acoustic guitar on the wall of her room. My husband easily hung them with the provided hardware. The arms are adjustable, so the same size hook holds all the  instruments. The padding is adequate to protect the finish and the hook is sturdy enough to support the weight. I'm very happy with this purchase.
