I was interested after purchasing a banjo in investing into some finger picks, having some previous experience with them and not being completely satisfied with the standard Dunlop style finger picks, I chose to order these on a whim.<br /><br />They shipped very quickly and arrived much sooner than the estimate given,<br /><br />Although upon opening the package and seeing that they where a bit tangled, after some time and prying, I was able to separate all 3 picks.<br /><br />They are working wonderful for my banjo playing and are also effective when I play my dobro!
