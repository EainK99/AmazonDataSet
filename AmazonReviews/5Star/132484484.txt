To say that most products today are cheaply made is an understatement, but this case is an exception. It is better quality than I expected even with the other reviews. I am an avid collector of vinyl and also a father of kids including a 2 year old that thinks daddy's collection is hands on. This will be used for my more valuable vinyl, but I am seriously considering purchasing more.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
