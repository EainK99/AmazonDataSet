What I wanted. It will hold my Vinyl Collection. The only downside was the instructions. pictures, very few words.<br />Take your time when reading and the putting together this unit don't try to get ahead. I did and had to take it about half way apart to get one of the cams out of its hole very tight fit.<br />Also it heavy so get it where you want it then add your collection
