Among the capos I have, this certainly is one of the better ones. The construction and the material used is of good quality, and the single action clamp has an unparalleled advantage in live performances. I do not believe in 'one-size-fits-all' when it comes to music gear/accessories, but this capo can be used on most classical guitars. Depending on the construction and the action of the guitar, one &#34;may&#34; occasionally prefer capos with adjustable tension such as a Shubb.<br /><br />That said, for what it is made for - quick changes without affecting tuning (especially in live performances) - this capo has no equal for most purposes. Great buy!
