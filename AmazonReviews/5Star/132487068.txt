I ordered this through a wish list as a gift to a 1 year old boy. the drum was packaged well and is a good size for a kid. comes with 2 mallets, I think. the box was sealed so I could not see inside but I can hear the mallets moving about. the box has a peak through window so you can see the drum and the fabric. looked really nice to me and felt like a good drum even an adult could use. I hope our little cousin loves his gift and drums on it all the time. hopefully his parents wont hate us :)
