This came from Israel so it took awhile but it was worth the wait.  Still learning to play it.  The polish is so beautiful....I did not buy the protective cover and would recommend that to anyone buying this beautiful instrument.  We blow the shofar to start the Sabbath and on feast days so it is important enough to have a proper protective covering which we will be buying soon.  Shalom.
