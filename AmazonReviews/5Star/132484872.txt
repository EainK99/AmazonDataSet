The guys in my shop are very impressed with this product.  Tusq is much harder than bone and rings like a bell when you drop it on the floor. So acoustic guitar sound quality is much improved over bone or the old OEM soft plastic parts. Machining to a correct fit requires a fresh sanding belt in our vertical belt sander, but we do get to that perfect fit eventually.  My only complaint is that the manufacturer leaves injection mold marks on one side.  Not a big deal since they do sand off.  We exclusively rebuild Harmony H1260 guitars.  These vintage instruments always need a new saddle.  So TUSQ 3/32 thick blanks are the way to go.  (Luthier's hot tip: the original saddle on an H1260 bridge is 1/16 inch.  That makes it easy to align and accurately cut a new saddle slot to 3/32 since you have 1/64 wood removal on each side of the original.  If you align the cutter correctly you will never have any of the original saddle plastic showing. Be sure to plain off the original down as close to the bridge wood as you can before cutting the new slot.)<br /><br />We are converting 100% to this product.
