There are sites on the internet and apps for smartphones which will play the necessary notes so I can tune my violin, but I have to keep reaching over and pressing keys on the computer or phone.  There are also electronic tuners which indicate if a note played on the instrument is sharp or flat, allowing adjustment and tuning, but why pay for that?  For me it is just simpler to hold this in my mouth, blow the notes, and use both hands to tune the violin.  Simple and effective.
