The Mister I received exceeded my expectations. It came with it's own power source, I wasn't expecting that. It creates a smaller flow of mist than I've had before, but that means less moisture on surfaces below the mister. I would like a higher quality cover to keep the mister from shooting up, but you get what you pay for. Over all I am very happy with this product.
