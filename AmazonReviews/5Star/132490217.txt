As a woman and also getting older now, I find it harder and harder to squeeze my spring-loaded capo to clamp onto the neck of my guitar.  Also I don't play much anymore these days but this portable capo is so great to have on my keychain for impromptu situations. It's light but yet effective and very easy to strap onto the neck of my guitar.  All the strings are crystal clear and it works just as good, if not better, than those fancy ones selling alongside this little portable one. It works just as well on my electric guitar as it does on my acoustic guitar.  What a great idea to attach a pick to the capo as well to bring along everywhere I go!  The guitar playing in the FREE album downloads are just awesome.  Love this capo.  I don't leave home without it now.
