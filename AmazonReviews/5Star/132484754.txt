I'll start off simple;<br /><br />PROS: Like having four microphones in one<br />Amazing sound quality<br />Easy to set up<br />Very versatile<br />Solid and stable<br /><br />CONS:<br />Stand design picks up desk/pc noise.<br />Paint chips easily<br /><br />Now, I need a very good microphone to do vocal work, and for the price, this one takes the cake. Worked right out of the box, and<br />the sound quality is perfect once I got the settings right. Very pleased, and would buy a product from Blue again.
