This violin is absolutely gorgeous, both in sound and in appearance. The strings, on the other hand, are absolutely atrocious. They are very tinny and hard to tune, and I snapped both G strings the first go around so I had to use the spare D string as a replacement. I'm definitely going to upgrade the strings to something more worthy soon... The bows are both excellent, and the rosin is surprisingly good quality. The shoulder rest leaves a bit to be desired, as it's just a bit too short for my narrow shoulders. The case is very good quality, and both it and the violin don't have that &#34;fresh out of the factory&#34; smell. All in all, even the horrible strings couldn't bring down my rating on this violin!
