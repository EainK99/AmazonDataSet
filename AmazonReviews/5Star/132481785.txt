For someone who wan'ts to entertain and being able to mix and contantly play music this unit is great. I had it for almost 4 months and is working great. I recommend this unit it comes with free virtual dj the simple version but enough to mix and play music. This unit is also good for a beginners djs to get your feet wet. I like that is small but not that fragile so far is a 5 star rating for what it is supposed to do.
