This is a really great tuner for an awesome price. The local music store had these for a lot more, so I got this one from Amazon. I had the blue version of this, which does not have the microphone, and I loved that one as well. When I gave my guitar away, I gave away the tuner too. So I bought this as a replacement. Clips on easy to pretty much anything. I've tuned my bass, my acoustic guitar, electric guitar, mandolin. Very quick to tune the guitar. Can see it well on a dark stage, but not noticeable to the audience. Recommend!
