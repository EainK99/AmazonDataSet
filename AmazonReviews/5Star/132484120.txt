Starting a new band and bought 2 of these to see how they would sound.  Now going back to buy 2 more.  I play electric guitar through a Line 6 Pod direct to the board and out through these speakers.  Sound quality is great and I can stay beneath the vocalist easily.  We used passive Yamaha monitors in the past and considered those THE reference for on-stage monitors.  But these match them easily and have more EQ flexibility. Differentiating feature is the compression driver instead of the standard horn.  The horns in the Yamahas disappeared at about 2' right/left of axis which made sharing a monitor between two singers difficult.  The F1320's drive was stayed the same as far as 4' off axis...a big plus.<br /><br />And even with a class D amp in them they are lighter than the Yamaha's.  A great value.
