I didn't need more than a couple inputs and outputs for my PC and laptop, and I had read a lot of good reviews about these new focusrite boxes, so I decided to pick up two of these. The price was right, the sound is great, and it just works and hasn't given me any hassles. I can record excellent sounding audio and play back audio without any noise from the computers, good stuff.
