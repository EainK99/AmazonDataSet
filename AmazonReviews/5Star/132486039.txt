This thing is pretty damn cool if you're into doing karaoke nights in your home.  The design and snazzy with light blue led lights that light up when you adjust anything on the mic or the box.  I also like how the design is slim so you can stack it in your media center.  The racking mounts you see on the picture are optional if you're wondering what those are. They come off so it fits well next to your bluray player and other devices under your tv.<br /><br />What's important for me is ease of use.  I'm not a pro karaoke user or KJ so my experience is just from using at home.  I wanted something that I can turn on, easily pick up, and start using.  So far this system has served very well for that purpose.  I also want the reassurance that the quality is above par and this certainly has met my expectations in terms of sound and build.  The mic feels solid and well built.
