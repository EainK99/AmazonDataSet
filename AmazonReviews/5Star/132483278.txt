Initial impression:  This thing is fun!  Came out of the box in good shape (except for broken e string).  Looks good, build quality seems good for the price.  It's an eye-catcher.  You can't see it without wanting to play it.  Sounds like it should.  The legs went on easily, but don't provide much stability.  I took them off again and played it on my lap.
