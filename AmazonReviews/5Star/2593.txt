Very clear display with large, easy to read letters and a distinctive green hue when the note is in tune. The screen rotates and adjusts on a swivel ball joint to accommodate almost any viewing angle that might be needed, a great improvement over previous models.<br /><br />It's very easy to use as well, as there's a single button that is used to toggle between Chromatic, Guitar, Bass, Ukulele and Violin modes. A simple hold of the button for 3 seconds turns it on and off, and there's a auto-off feature to save on battery. Plus, given that it's a clip on, there's no messing around with plugging in instrument cables or holding a tuner's mic close enough to hear -- the tuner is right on the headstock, right next to the pegs whenever you need it.<br /><br />Very easily worth the money -- I'm planning on picking up a second one to keep on my home-away-from-home guitars.
