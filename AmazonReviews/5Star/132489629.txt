I looked and reviewed for weeks in this price range and a little bit more and came across these. These bongos have all the appointments of more expensive bongos but without the price tag.  Siam Oak, natural skins.  The chrome hardware is not cheap and flimsy.  The high gloss finish is very nice.  You can tighten these up to some really nice bongo tones. The rims are very comfortable to play. You will find a fellow playing Tycoons on an instructional DVD. \\"Bongo Grooves\\".  Get it to go along with these.
