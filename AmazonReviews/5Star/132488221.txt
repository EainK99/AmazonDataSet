I asked Santa for this case last Christmas and despite all my bad behavior in '12 he put it under the tree. I got the grey one because I have about a '70 King Zephyr silver plated and it fits very well. My buddies told me to go black but I actually think the grey one is nice and different in a good way. After seeing it they have come around. You will get compliments but most people just look at it with that jealous stare.<br /><br />I have used it quite frequently since and it has held up perfectly between going back and forth from the truck to the locker to the bandstand. Some people on here seem skeptical to call it sturdy but mine was in the bottom of a charter bus on a round trip from St. Louis to Nashville and both it and the horn were unscathed so I don't think there is any need to worry about that.The compartments are well designed and even though you can't get the music folder in it you can get everything else put away quite neatly. The little netting, zippers and straps are nifty and keep things where you want them.<br /><br />For as nice of a case as it is I think the price is very fair. Sometimes you have to play with the strap a little to get it to ride on your shoulder just right but that is small potatoes compared to lugging around a bulky, moldy old wooden case with fake alligator peeling off and leaving black streaks on your gig pants. It is very light, and for a smaller guy like myself it is great to not have to have one arm sticking out walking like a penguin just to stay balanced. It has been good to me and I highly recommend it!
