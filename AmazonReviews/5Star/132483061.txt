Wow.... these bongos are very very high quality, looks and sound.. and especially at 100 bucks. Im a percussionist and have played on many high quality bongos and these are just as good as much more expensive sets. The heads that come on them are really nice and just feel excellent. I am very pleased and I recommend these to anyone who wants a high quality set. (much more so than meinl headliners or lp aspire... yuck).
