I was going crazy looking for a non latching footswitch, and then i came across this one. Perfect for what I needed. I was trying to trigger an audio record button in Ableton Live and I had a latching footswitch which basically made me have to stomp once to start my recording, and then twice to stop my recording. Yeah, that got old fast.  Non latching basically gives you an \\"on\\" signal for the down position and an \\"off\\" signal for the up position which is exactly what I needed.  Perfect for it's purpose.
