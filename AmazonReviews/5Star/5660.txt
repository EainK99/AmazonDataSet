This case was a lifesaver.  I was being deployed and wanted to take my keyboard with me.  It is padded and used it to but my keyboard in it along with the stand and pedal and then checked it in to the airline as checked baggage.  I did add those packing balloons into the case for extra padding but it made it through the checked baggage process from the States to Bahrain and then back.  I was very happy. I would recommend this case to anyone looking to travel or not with their keyboard.
