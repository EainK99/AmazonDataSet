I purchased my strap directly from GruvGear's website during Labor Day weekend so I could get the special discount they were running.  I didn't use Amazon's fulfillment services.<br /><br />I ordered the black leather signature Duostrap.  GruvGear shipped the strap quickly. I opened the box, and to my surprise, they sent me the black NEO Duostrap.  I immediately called GruvGear and they said they would send me the correct leather strap and a return postage label.  After an extra nag call they did exactly what they said.  Their customer service is excellent.<br /><br />I put the NEO Duostrap in place on my shoulders but I didn't install it on any instruments.  I like the look and feel of the one piece leather strap because it looks more solid.  The NEO part of the strap is well padded and I'm confident will provide a similar experience to the leather strap.  I don't know if there is a significant amount of difference between the two models to justify an extra $50.<br /><br />I'm around 6' and weigh around 145 lbs and I'm in my middle 40s.  I play bass guitar in church and we have begun practicing prior to our services.  This means I'm wearing my instrument for 2 to 3 hours.  My cheap cloth strap I've used for years finally started digging into my shoulder causing pretty significant pain.  I considered switching to a lighter, smaller bass or an acoustic bass.  I thought I would give this strap a try and see if it would help.  By the way, I play a right handed Peavey Cirrus 5 string bass and it weighs just under 10 lbs.<br /><br />My wife and I installed my strap locks on the strap.  It was almost a two person job because the leather is very tight when new.  It took a little effort to get the 2nd strap in the correct position.  Once it was strapped in, the instrument stays put really well.  I have concerns that the leather on the 2nd strap could loosen up over time, where the strap buttons itself, making the strap useless.  I'm hoping this is a false concern.<br /><br />I used the strap this past Sunday for the first time and my left shoulder didn't have any pain.  The strap forces me to stand in a near perfect posture.  I'm able to move around and the instrument stays put.  I'm used to playing my bass in a more upright position.  This means my head stock is up near my ear and the body is much lower.  The strap forces the instrument into a flat, straight position.  I like wearing my bass pretty high so the position is the same as any of the pictures you see on the internet.  I can move the head stock upwards a little bit but not much.  I would liken the experience to sitting down and holding the instrument on your leg.<br /><br />My upper neck muscles and right shoulder were a little sore afterwards.  The soreness is nothing like the pain I experienced in my left shoulder before.  I'm pretty sure my neck muscles are sore because this is a new stress to a different muscle group.  The angle the instrument lays causes me to push my right shoulder up and out a little more.  I've had right shoulder pain on and off for several years so I don't consider this a problem with the strap.<br /><br />The only negative thing i can say about the strap is the 3 inches of leather on the back of my right shoulder blade seems a little wide.  It would be nice if it was more narrow in that area or came over to the left of my body more.  It feels like it is hanging off the side of my body a little bit.<br /><br />In summary, I'm pleased with the strap.  I would recommend it to anyone suffering from pain because of a heavy instrument.  I will try and post an update after a few months of use.<br /><br />9/9/2017<br />I install strap locks on all my basses so I can use this strap.<br /><br />I received an email from Amazon because someone had a question of how adjustable the strap is. I am 5' 11&#34; and you can see where the strap fits on me. I also have a few shots of how much space is left for adjustments./>I used the strap this past Sunday for the first time and my left shoulder didn't have any pain.
