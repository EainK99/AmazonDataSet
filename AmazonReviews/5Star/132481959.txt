I recently ordered this kit from Amazon to service a 2007 Taylor 110e I bought used. The tools made it easy to strip everything down, clean it, and put it back together. The tools are pro quality and do not feel cheap and the case is sturdy. All the included tools and cleaning products worked great. The kit also came with an Ernie Ball sticker as well. I would honestly recommend buying this if you have no tools and need some to work on your guitar. You will not be disappointed.
