I am a uke player, this allows more bass tones.  String action is good, with long resonance and sustain time.  I have tuned with dropped G which is great for finger-picking. Good tone with the quality strings.  I have much more expensive  ukes, but this one gives great value for the price.  Travel, take to the beach without worry.  My violin strings cost as much as this fun package.
