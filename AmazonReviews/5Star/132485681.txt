I have a Yanagisawa S6, and this case holds it perfectly. A lot of the other people on here who bought it for their soprano don't seem to like it, but I think they're just lazy. The thing is that it's customizable, so as to fit a large variety of saxes, whether they be straight or curved neck, removable neck or one piece, traditional palm keys or Mark VI style,  or what have you. It just takes a little experimentation to get the little foam pieces to fit your instrument right, but once you do it works great.  Very sturdy, very light-weight, with a handle that is comfortable to hold for long periods of time, way more storage space than you will ever need, and a shoulder strap. This thing has it all. To me and most others I know, this and all other Protec cases are the best you can get for the money.
