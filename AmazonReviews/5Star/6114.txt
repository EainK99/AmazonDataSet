I researched A BUNCH of speakers and I settled on the ELS-15BT. I was looking for a speaker that would be ideal for tailgating at football games and both indoor and outdoor parties and I think I found the perfect one. It just came in today, right on time, in great condition. No scratches, marks, dents or anything. It is very simple to use. From out of the package to playing music was about 40 seconds. The bluetooth is perfect and the sound quality is AMAZING. Super clear and great bass. I've yet to use it outside but so far I am VERY impressed. I'll update my review once I use it outside but I am loving this speaker! (stand is not included).  UPDATE: I've used this speaker twice at a tailgate outside and my knly complaint is that sometimes the bluetooth will not connect. A few times it connected after 10 minutes or so but yesterday it wouldn't connect for an hour but it ended up working. Speaker is SUPER loud outside and is perfect for my tailgates. I usually don't have a problem with the bluetooth when I am indoors but overall its a great speaker. So worth it.  Second Update: after a few months of *heavy* use the ELS 15BT randomly shut off and wouldn't turn back on. Keep in mind I used this for hours at a time at my tailgates and didn't use it with the care it should have been handled with, but it still broke. However, under the 1-year factory warranty, I sent the speaker in to American DJ and got it repair and returned in 3 weeks. Works great now! Impressed by customer service!
