I love my little Uke. I bought it for myself as a Christmas gift to myself. I realized within a day that it would indeed need &#34;Aquila AQ-S Nylgut Soprano Ukulele Strings.&#34;  The difference in tone, sound, and quality was just amazing after purchasing and putting on the strings. Seriously - invest in good strings. Remember a good sounding instrument is fun to play, a bad sounding instrument gets left behind.<br /><br />Now that being said. For any new Uke players out there, remember that the strings are nylon and not steel, so you need to stretch your strings and tune tune tune. For the first several weeks you will be tuning every time you pick up your instrument.  Then suddenly it will only be once a day.<br /><br />This uke came with a nice little chord chart that was super helpful. The pineapple shape takes a bit of time to get use to, it does slip from time to time. But as far as quality, looks, and sound are concerned, I have not been disappointed in the Makala brand (I also have a standard one with the dolphin as well). Change, stretch, and tune those strings.<br /><br />The funnest instrument to play and teach!
