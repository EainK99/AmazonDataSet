I'm just an amateur DJ. After playing around with FL Deckadance, I thought it'd be far nicer using an actual console with it than just my mouse and keyboard and it definitely is.<br /><br />It doesn't come with any guidance on how to use it (I guess it assumes you know what you're doing on your own), so I'm not really any better at mixing stuff, but it's definitely high quality. It's made of sturdy materials, the buttons feel good under my fingers and the turntables have grips and turn easily.<br /><br />The one thing that's unfortunate about it is that it doesn't have a dedicated button to switch between a pair of decks. To elaborate - the new version of Deckadance features four decks instead of just the two it had when I bought the RMX, so I'm rather out of luck making use of that second pair of decks until FL makes me a software workaround mapping (and I re-purpose another of the keys on the board).<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a great board and definitely recommended for the novice prepared to learn how to actually use it elsewhere.
