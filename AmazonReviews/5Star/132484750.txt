Metal Method is a great learning tool for the beginner to the advanced guitarist.  It does contain advanced techniques that are taught at a slower pace and then slowly sped up.  Very excellent lesson plans.  It covers everything from Barre chords, to tapping, pinched harmonics and pick raking.  Great balance of rhythm and lead exercises.  Using this method first and then going to an guitar instructor helped me push to either further advanced principals and challenges.  This will get your technique and foundation solid.  Then the guitar instructor can provide motivation to apply these skills in a writing scenario.  Provide further education on theory or help you improve your guitar ear.  I will say this Guitar instructors could learn a lot on the how to advance the intermediate guitarist by progressing the lesson plans just like this method does.  This is a great method and if you do not have the money for an instructor every week,  this will advance you just as well.  I have owned this product for many years and I still find myself going back to this method time and again.  I also own learn to play and master series, lick library methods and basic tab forms.  IF you want something that is strong in overall quality, theory, rhythm then this is for you.  Nothing is left out. I wish that Marks' would offer a second series to this as an advance course of study. Hopefully someday.
