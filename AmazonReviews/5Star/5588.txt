Bought the orange mpow swift.  They arrived promptly and were very easy to connect.  They have a great stereo sound and the battery lasts for at least 6-8 hours of constant use.  The only issue I had was one of the ear pieces became dislodged and the wire dislocated after moderate use.  I contacted the product maker and they promptly sent a new pair. This is what customer service should be.  A great product from a company concerned with the purchasers satisfaction.
