This bag is so well designed!  It fits my trumpet, two mouthpieces, straight mute, cup mute, Harmen mute, plunger, clip-on stand light and there's still room for more!  I bought the backpack straps as well and they stow nicely in the side pouch since I don't use them all the time.  Really good quality workmanship.  It also comes with a 5-year warranty (don't forget to go on their website and register within 30-days of purchase in order to activate the warranty.  Also keep the tag that comes with it so you'll have the model number and serial number when you register it).
