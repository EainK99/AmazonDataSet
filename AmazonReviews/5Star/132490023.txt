Although this is very heavy, I was able to roll it out slowly, measure and cut it with an ordinary pair of scissors.<br />I installed it directly under my carpet and carpet padding and sealed and secured its perimeters with acoustical tape.<br />I am very happy with the product and the comparative ease (with a good amount of heavy lifting) with which I  was able to install completely by myself.
