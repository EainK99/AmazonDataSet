If you're looking to catch good audio, here you go.  I have a handheld recorder with a mic input.  I tested with the built in mic and then with the corded mic.  The audio with this mic was so much cleaner.  Some people complain about the windscreen being hard to keep on, I didn't seem to have that problem, maybe they didn't have it on all the way or were a little rough with it, I don't know.  The lack of an LED for the power is true though.  If you research stuff before you buy it then you've already heard that this mic doesn't have an LED to show Power on/ Battery good.  I knew it before I bought it, just have some extra batteries (it's a common button size battery).  Change it out before/after doing interviews or long sessions.  The mic picks up really well, but keep in mind that it is an omnidirectional mic and CAN pick up louder noises in the background.  My experience is that in a normal setting, it picks up just enough background sound to be natural and almost unnoticeable.<br /><br />Item arrived on time and was exactly as described.  Extremely happy with this purchase.
