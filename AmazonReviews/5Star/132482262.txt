Great quality Saxophone.  Beats renting one for sure.  I got this for my son's 5th grade class. He is loving it also.  He is able to play at least three songs after just two weeks of practice. The only thing that I would recommend is to get a better neck strap.  I purchased an extra Yamaha mouthpiece since some of the other reviews said the the mouthpiece is of low quality.  However, I found that the mouthpiece that comes with it works perfectly. Now I have a spare one in case my son drops it and breaks it somehow.  I would highly recommend this Saxophone for any beginners.
