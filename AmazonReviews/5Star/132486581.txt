I have started out playing bassoon on the regular Jones reeds, they give me the best pitch, control, and feedback. After going through a mid-life crisis but for reeds, I checked out many other brands to see if there were any other reeds that were superior. I couldn't find any, except for the Jones Artist reeds, the artist reeds are different in that they seem to be pre-adjusted, and have better quality cane than the regular reeds. I cannot recommend any other reed than the Jones reeds.
