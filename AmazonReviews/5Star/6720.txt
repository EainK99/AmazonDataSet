My daughter has been playing violin for 8 years and viola for 1 year.  We own both the viola and violin Everest shoulder rests (yes, there is a difference!).  We have tried other brands but Everest makes the most comfortable one and it doesn't slip out of place like others.  If your child is using the sponge and bands, and you are wondering if you should spend the money to upgrade them to a shoulder rest, the answer is a resounding yes.  It makes a difference in how they hold and support the instrument and, therefore, how they play.  I noticed a difference in my daughter's performance immediately and she was so much more comfortable when playing.  She could practice and play longer without neck and shoulder fatigue.
