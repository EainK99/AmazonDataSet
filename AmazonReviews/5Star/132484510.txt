THis is a GREAT Headset! Please note: One size does not always fit all. THis one is unique in that it has ear pieces that make it possible to actaully get it on to one's head. The mic element is small and very sensitive, though it does NOT pass air noises back through my wireless system. There is no big piece poking me in the side of the head by my ear and even woth a windscreen on hte element it is almost unnoticeable while using or observing a wearer. The price alone is worth you investment. It is not designed to be rough-housed though. So the operator and material handler will have to treat it with the respect this type of equipment deserves. If you have 'prima donna vocalists' do not let them handle them when they get irritated...they WILL BREAK IT!. Great piece of gear...I have 2 and may get some more....
