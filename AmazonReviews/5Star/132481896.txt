I purchased my Trinity College Octave Mandolin used some years ago and have been extremely pleased with the build quality, durability, playability, and sound that it produces.  This is a wonderful instrument.<br /><br />Don't let the 3-star review fool you with its rating - the guy hasn't even seen this instrument.  BUT heed his advice - either have a professional set it up with new strings for you or do it yourself.  This requires adjustment of the bridge.
