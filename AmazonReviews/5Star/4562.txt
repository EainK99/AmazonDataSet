Bought a Fender Malibu Dick Dale in Istanbul, Turkey at the Grand Bazar. It is a very fine instrument, sound is full and strong without amp. Have hardly explored possibilites with amp, but first experiences were pretty promising. Like all acoustics with steel strings, playing requires some effort in the left hand, but not more than average. The design is exceptionally beautiful, it's an instrument with a classic charisma. Very glad I spent an afternoon negotiating the price and even more time figuring out how to transport it home.
