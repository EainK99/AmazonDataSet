They are not for everyone. But they work for me. I needed a string that is easy playing and is significantly louder than standard classical strings. Both true. And as a bonus, these strings don't squeak when your technique is less than flawless moving about the neck. As I age, my hand strength is less and my arthritis reduce my flexibility. These strings make those issues less of a problem.<br /><br />On the downside, because they are thinner than standard classical strings, you may have to alter your set-up as they sit lower in the nut. They are bright sounding strings, but not so much as they don't still sound like a nylon guitar. As far as string tension goes, they are pretty much the same total tension as high tension nylons. Also, many classical players rebel against the ball ends.  However, I find that the ball end stringing makes the saddle angle a bit steeper, thus contributing to the volume/sustain increase.  And of course, they are not cheap, and their useful life is about the same as D'Addario strings.<br /><br />So if you think you want to try them, you'll have to eat the cost if you don't like them. Or put them on your steel string where you'll find similar benefits.
