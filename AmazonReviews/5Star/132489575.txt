I bought this for our middle school cheerleading program.  I was needing something loud enough for the cheerleaders to hear it at half time while the crowd can hear it as well. The bluetooth syncing is awesome, totally recommend having that feature.  My Iphone found it instantly and was able to play music through the speaker in seconds!  I love the portability, the luggage type handle is genius.  The battery life is impressive and way more than we need.  This is fantastic and with this price you can't go wrong!
