These HD 280 Pro headphones are comparable to Sony MDR-7510. The audio is clean and neutral. Audio detail comes out clean but the bass is a little bit dry. I'm told in time the bass will get fuller with use.<br /><br />HD 280 Pro headphones are good for any audio with fine detail. Also, if your mixing these are sound accurate.<br /><br />I can recommend these headphones.
