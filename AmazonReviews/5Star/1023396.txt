Excellent sound!!!,I'm an experienced player,and have played many older doumbeks that were heavier.This one sounds just as good as Most other ones i've played,its almost just as loud as the more expensive doumbeks if not just as loud.<br /><br />The teks are super crisp and the finger rolls come through clear.  The highs can get loud and the doum is basey, especially if you tweak the tuning. The drum over-all cuts through pretty well. The design on the one I received was very different than the one in the picture.  so I was a little disappointed, but it still looks & sounds really nice, and its a lot lighter than older doumbeks.  For $140 after tax I'm really impressed so far. I received it  in two days as promised.  The case is thin and fairly cheap, but wrapping it in a towel before you put it in is just an extra protectional step. Will be looking for a  better case. The extra drum head and tuning wrench were a big plus for the money.  I highly recommend this drum and most other Meinl instruments and accessories, which I have used I've used in the past. When other companies fail me, Meinl always saves the day at great prices!!!
