These mics sound awesome.  All I do is gate these and tweak the channel EQ a little depending on which tom / frequency I want to accent.  They sound awesome - pro all the way.  These mics are basically Beta 56 that are made in China to keep the cost down.  Good rugged metal case and screen.  And they coume with a killer clip on drum mount that's made of hard rubberlike material that won't mar your rims.  I would definitely buy them again!
