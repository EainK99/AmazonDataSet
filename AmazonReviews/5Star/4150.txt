This is a pair of reliable, quality made hangars for guitars and ukuleles. I picked these up to hang my concert and tenor ukuleles in my music room. The hangers are made of steel and thick coated with a black protective layer that gives it a nice look. The prongs are wide enough to allow easy placement and removal of your instruments, and they're wrapped with foam to protect your guitar/ukulele necks. I especially like that the prongs swivel completely on the bracket, allowing you to choose if you want to mount horizontally or vertically. Mounting requires four (4) screws (screws and wall anchors are included), which I think is probably a bit of overkill... but a nice safety touch.<br /><br />NOTE: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I review many products, and I only review products that I personally use and sample.
