These headphones are awesome!!<br /><br />They look, feel, and sound professional.<br />The sound quality is rich and clear.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about<br />these headphones were that the<br />cable runs through just one of the ear<br />pieces, not both of them. But it's not<br />a big deal, just a minor opinion.<br /><br />This is definitely a good buy.
