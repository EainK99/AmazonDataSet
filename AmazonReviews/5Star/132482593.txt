I bought this because I needed a nice tape emulation delay pedal. At the same time I was playing around with loop pedals and came across a demo of this on youtube. The pedal is wayyy better than I expected with all features (tape delay, looper, and digital delay) - the tape delay heads have individual outputs, so if you have a nice recording gig at home, you can hook up all 5 outputs (1 mix, 1 tape head, 2 tape head, 3 tape head, and 4 tape head) to a 8 input mixer/interface and create swirling, panning, delay effects. Its really cool if you have it all hooked up and setup correctly. Im currently using this as my outboard delay effect that I route through the aux channels (I use a MOTU 828 firewire). The looper is great as long as you have rhythm and know when to press record and play to start and end phrases. Again, I was very happy that this pedal exceeded my expectations.<br />NOTE TO DELAY TWEEKERS (meaning you like to turn the knobs while the delay is on to create crazy sounds...) This is not the pedal for you. When you turn the delay settings while a signal is going through it, the delay effect is reset every time you make an adjustment. So you can not make those crazy delay tweeking swoops and robotic metal chainsaw oscillations like some other delay pedals...
