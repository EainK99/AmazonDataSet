I ordered this guitar for getting into a class in school my dad bought me it. I wait and the day I go to work it comes and im not there. So than I went to the fed ex store and pick it up. the big box that it came in was \\"abused\\" the side was ripped, but the guitars box was fine (there was two boxes the bigger one was ripped and torn but the guitar came in a smaller box) the guitar was properly shipped and packaged and in amazing condition. I love it and I would certainly buy it if your considering it the only problem is finding a affordable case that fits it but it is amazing buy one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
