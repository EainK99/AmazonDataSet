To be fair, I'm assuming this is a tube screamer clone, and I've never had a tube screamer, but this thing does what I wanted it to. It sounds like garbage on its own (hollow, tinny, harsh, zero warmth), but I don't use it on its own. I got it to run in front of a fuzz pedal (ram's head clone) to get stupid gain. It does that fine. It takes it from real nasty to God-awful, blood-boiling, soulless, raunchy noise.
