I have purchased a few of these effects pedals, and I mounted them in a pedal box. I am working with three guitar players, (I don't play guitar myself), and they seem to be having quite a good time to combine which pedal combination they are going to use for each of their various songs. Mounted in the box, the pedal are benefiting from the supplied 9V power source, and this resolves the issue of batteries or individual power supply. I use low cost guitars in the home studio, and these precious units make good compensation for the sound quality.
