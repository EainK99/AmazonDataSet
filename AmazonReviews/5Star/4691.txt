Love it, I put it right above my monitor, and I forget its there. I have a USB microphone so I didn't end up using the cable that came with it, but doesn't look bad after I zip tied the end to the frame.<br />I had no problems getting it into position(aside from hitting the monitor), and it hasn't moved since I put it there. I used an attachment I already had for the microphone and it fit right on.<br />If you are looking for a simple microphone stand for your desk, this is worth the money.
