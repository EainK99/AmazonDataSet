Sweet!  I was very happy when I saw the Uku in the box.  I have a Rubin Tenor in Zebra wood and it sounds great with Low G.  I tried a Mahogany laminate concert but wasn't happy.  I took a chance that Caramel is from the same factory as the Rubin.  I can't tell for sure but the quality is good and the sound of the Zebra wood is great. Much better tone than the Mahogany $120 concert and with the same Aquila strings.<br />The wood is open pored, lightly finished and is not slippery in the hands.  The only problem I found was high on the back of the neck the grain was raised a bit making the neck rough, but a little 0000 steel wool cleared that up. Construction is  excellent and everything is straight and level and the intonation is almost perfect to the 12th fret!<br />The built in tuner is a really good idea, but I haven't tried it with an amp...yet. The tuner takes two 2032 cell batteries, easy to find.  The Tuner matched my Snark so no external hangers on needed.<br />As for sound it is sweet and more like a tenor , not plunky like a lot of cheap, and not so cheap concerts.<br />I highly recommend this ukulele it has excellent sound  and is worth the MSRP, but for the offered price and the reasonable shipping time it is a steal!<br /><br />Aug 2017 - I've had  this Uke for two years now and it has proven to be excellent, although I did have to lower the bridge a bit, file a  few fret edges, and buff it with 0000 steel wool.  I changed the strings for D'Addario Carbons ( EJ99's) and it chimes like a bell.  This is my go to carry around Uke, compact, easy to play and beautiful sounding.  It has helped me learn to play and I have played a lot of different ukes trying to find out if there was a better uke out there.  So far it seems that to get much better will cost over $500! It has a nice mellow sound and is a real joy.
