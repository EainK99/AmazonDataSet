Ok, so here goes. I've had 3 sets of these, in 3 years. They've never failed, or let me down. I use an old Marshall plexi. I play a lot of gigs, both indoors and outdoors. I travel a lot. I change power tubes once a year, because they get thrashed. I keep them for back up.<br />  I recommend these ,because of tone, cost effectiveness, and rugged build. For a new manufacture tube this is a great choice . Does the job and sounds great.
