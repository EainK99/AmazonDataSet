I have had a number of distortion/OD pedals and, up to now, the only keepers have been my old Boss HM-2 (too brash for normal use but only occasionally fits what I'm doing) and a recent addition, the MXR 78 Custom Badass Distortion (very close to what I was looking for but still a bit harsh for my liking on some of what I play).  I've always wanted to get the Boss OD-2 because it has such a great and controllable classic natural sounding OD but it was discontinued.  I read about the OD-3 being a successor to the OD2 (with good reviews) and decided to get this pedal and just see how it fits in with what I do.  The OD-3 showed up a few days ago and I have been testing it out with it configured just about every way possible.  I like the tone at about 11:00 to 12:00 and the OD throughout the whole range.  I like the way it behaves (like a tube amp) with the notes still sounding pretty clean when playing lightly but growing dirty as you dig in harder.  I feel like this pedal completes the low to mid range of OD/distortion where the other 2 pedals cover the other end.  I would definitely recommend this pedal if you like classic rock and highly manageable levels of OD from clean to pretty ragged.  The tone at 11:00ish is very good for letting the lower notes stand out while also keeping the high end clear.  Going back and forth (pedal on- pedal off) I have it set where the natural tone (clean on amp) is close to the tone with OD on.  Then I just set the level to about what the other OD/Distortion pedals are at and then put the Drive knob wherever I feel like and it seems like it works for me throughout the entire range.  Some criticize it's limited range of output sounds, where I feel like that is what I want.  Something predictable and easy to find the one sound I am looking for.  I only use about 6 pedals and I like to be able to know them all well enough to dial in my favorite sounds quickly. Overall, a &#34;must have&#34; for the classic rocker.
