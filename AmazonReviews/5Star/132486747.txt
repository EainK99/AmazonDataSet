Construction quality is good. The materials used are decent. But if you really want to make this guitar sound better, more playable and overall comparable to many $400+ guitars, do the following:<br /><br />1. Remove the Factory strings<br />2. Replace the cheap nut and saddle<br />3. Put some good strings<br />4. Give it a good setup<br />5. Remove the pick guard<br /><br />All this should not cost you more than $100 ($30 if you do it yourself), and you'll have one great guitar.
