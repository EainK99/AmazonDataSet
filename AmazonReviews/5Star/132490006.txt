I got this as a gift for my wife, for her new (2ndG) Nexus 7 tablet.  The build quality was really good and she is using it every day for about a month now with no signs of wear and tear.  She likes the red.<br /><br />What I didn't realize, and what made my wife so happy is the included stylus.  Her hands are quite dry and she was having problems with the touchscreen at times.  The stylus has eliminated all that.
