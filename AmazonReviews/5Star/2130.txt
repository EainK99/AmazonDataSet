I am a pianist and bought this to record myself playng with good quality sound and minimal background noise.  What a great product!  You can adjust the record levels so (my grand piano) your sound source does not overwhelm the device and cause crackles in the playback.  You can also record as .mp3 at varying levels of precision (ie memory space), same for .wav.  And you can convert one to the other within the device.  The visual interface is not that user friendly, but the user manual is comprehensive.  And you can download onto your PC and upload onto iTunes, creating your own playlists of your playing or send .mp3s to friends or teachers over email to let them hear your progress.  Plus just listening to myself from a recording is so edifying.  I love this little device.  Came fast and free with Prime.  Thanks Amazon!
