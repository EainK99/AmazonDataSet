A great little package with a big sound; never got the knobs passed 5. A wonderful blues amp, I love it! I can get changes in volume and tone simply with my hands,also I'm a fingerpicker, bare back style. I play an Epiphone  Special(like a studio Les Paul),sounds great through the amp. Dirty or clean, with just the force of picking attack. Like how an old 50's car looks, this is a beautiful,nostalgic piece...has that \\"era\\" vibe in looks and tone. A great amp for rockabilly too. For the cash, you can't go wrong...Peace,bluzcat
