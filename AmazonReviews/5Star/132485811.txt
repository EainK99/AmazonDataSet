Just added my new Hercules Stand to the studio and it  looks and works great! Very strong support for my 61 and 49 key midi keyboards. It looks really professional and the build is of high quality materials like round and square steel tubing. Not flimsy looking at all! It locks at different height levels for personal preference. And even though the second tier isn't height adjustable. It is also very sturdy! This stand is ready right out of the box. No assembly was required. Making it that much more of a bargain in my opinion. I'm really liking this stand. I would definitely recommend to a friend!
