Decided to teach myself bass so I bought this and a VOX PB10 amp. There were many good reviews on this unbelievably economical bass and so I jumped. I'm very pleased with my decision as this is a fine instrument at an amazing price. Packaging was minimal, just a form-fitting cardboard box but the item arrived unscathed. The construction is solid and the bass appears well built with a pretty good level of fit and finish. Astonishing, actually, for a $100 instrument.<br /><br />The sound out of the box is good but you really must go through the four key adjustments before it becomes &#34;playable.&#34; I recommend the Elixir Strings 1-4 series on bass setup with John Carruthers. If you do this, you will be very, very pleased with how the bass plays and sounds. It's magic.<br /><br />I'm already having a ton of fun messing around on this and look forward to taking some instruction. So if you're thinking about picking up the electric four-string bass, I can't think of a better, more economical, low risk entry than this Legacy bass. Highly recommended.
