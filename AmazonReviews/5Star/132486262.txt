I couldn't find a guitar pick the other day so I cut up an old credit card to use in a pinch. It was fun repurposing the old plastic, but I couldn't get the edges quite right, so I decided to explore pick making options.  I chose the Pick-a-Palooza because it got good reviews.  It works great!  Within minutes, my high school daughter had punched out a handful of picks using the plastic strips that came with the punch, and she's having fun creating her own picks now from other materials.  This product works as advertised and I highly recommend it.  The seller shipped promptly and we received our Pick-a-Palooza on time.
