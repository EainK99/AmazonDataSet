this little light of mine....oh boy it's gonna shine! Wasn't expecting much for the price, but it was definitely worth it! The 'voice control' doesn't really describe what it does though. It flickers with sound, so will flash along with any song you play. Pretty cool! And it was also brighter than expected.
