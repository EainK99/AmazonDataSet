Ignore the picture, which shows a violin case (rather than this case cover). The picture of the black VIOLA bag is correct. [[ASIN:B007XEVUM8 Mooradian Oblong Viola Case Cover - 15-16, Black Interior/Black Exterior]].<br /><br />MUSIC POCKET: My only \\"issue\\" with the product is the fact that the music product cannot hold a full-sized orchestra folder. But that would require the size and design to be changed a lot. The full-length \\"music pocket\\" is fairly wide and very tall. With my 40-year-old Jaeger case inside, it can easily contain a stand light, and a non-collapsing shoulder rest, and a few volumes of music at the same time (or MANY volumes of music alone). It's much larger than the largest music pocket in my previous experience; and the zipper,sewing seams etc. look very durable.<br /><br />BACKPACK STRAPS: It doesn't provide a horizontal chest strap to keep the vertical straps comfortable for a LONG walk, but the straps are comfortable and adjustable to a variety of sizes. I bought the product with these straps in mind - keeping the violin safely on my back during receptions and parties, instead of having to leave it somewhere out of my personal control.<br /><br />CASE/VIOLIN PROTECTION: It's excellent all around, but Mooradian has put a lot of extra padding at the corners and small ends of the case. If the covered case ever falls off of a chair or table, I would expect it to land on a corner. So this dramatically reduces the likelihood of cracking the top in such a disastrous accident.<br /><br />I'M DELIGHTED.
