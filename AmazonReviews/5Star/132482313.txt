This product is awesome! Super comparable to the Boss TU-3. Practically the same pedal. The only difference to me was that the Boss pedal is made out of metal and seems a little more sturdy, and this is just a super strong plastic with some metal parts. But you shouldn't be smashing your tuner pedal much anyways so they both should hold up equally. The best part of this is I ordered it halfway through a Thursday and it was at my doorstep early on the following Saturday morning! Worth the buy!
