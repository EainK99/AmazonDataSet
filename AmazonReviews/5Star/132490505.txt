It was exactly as i expected it and perfect in every way. This is a present for my geeky boyfriend for our 3 year anniversary coming up this Thursday and I'm certain that he will love it! I bought it so early in advance so i could get my hands on it before anyone else because i knew this was perfect for him. Though i was expecting it to take longer than 14 days, when it came a little earlier than 14 days, it was like an awesome surprise and i was very glad to have it in my possession to wrap it up in a pretty bow and keep it safe until this Thursday.<br /><br />THANK YOU!
