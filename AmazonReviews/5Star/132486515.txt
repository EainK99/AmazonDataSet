There aren't many reviews as of yet on the Moku select series, as they're a bit new I'd expect and there are many competitively mid priced ukuleles out there to choose from. That being said, having purchased the MS-60s, All I can say is, WOW I can't leave it alone:) I'm partial to mahogany in the first place,(my performance tenor is a handmade custom solid mahogany:), so I just had to try this soprano out. Living in San Francisco where the MOKU company is based I was a little apprehensive as my wonder was how can they compare to the handmade K's from Hawaii? Well it doesn't:) It's it's own little beast:) The fit an finish is flawless. Everything from the Abalone sound hole to the binding and closed tuners, bone nut and saddle, premium wood selection and a neck that glides within my hand flawlessly:) It's truly a beauty to look at as well as play. The sound is warm yet projective as one would expect from a handmade solid wood uke that will only sound even better as time goes on and the wood ages and mellows within your hands. I was specifically looking for a solid wood performance soprano to take with me everywhere, without breaking the bank or being fearful of taking it anywhere with me, such as I'd expect would be the case with a $1500+ \\"K\\" brand from the islands or my custom tenor for that matter. I FOUND IT!!!:) I will definitely be purchasing a tenor select from MOKU in the future, but for now I highly recommend checking out the MS-60s if you're looking for an affordable yet professional and beautifully sounding handmade solid wood soprano:) Happy strumming, Aloha
