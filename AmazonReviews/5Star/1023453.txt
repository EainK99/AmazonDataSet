I use this metronome for setting my cadence while running.  It is lightweight (I clip it to my shorts or my cap) and the volume can be turned up pretty high.  This is the second one of the very same metronome that I have had in the last 6 months.  The first one I had I forgot to remove when I went for a swim in the ocean.  It is not waterproof... otherwise it is a great little device.
