I purchased this for my son's birthday. He had been wanting an Ocarina for some time. It is great! Well made, and substantial feeling in your hand. The sound quality is VERY nice! He picked up on several songs pretty fast. Yes, it's not likely for younger kids (he's a teenager), but if you practice at it for a few days, you can pick it up pretty quickly! This doesn't come with the carrying sack or songbook... it is just the ocarina itself (some others are offered including the extras).
