I don't agree at all with the Guy who gave it 1 Star Cause the Delays are \\"Harsh\\" as he put it.<br />Which is fine that is his opinion and everyone has different Tastes.<br />That Said, I have and Love my MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay.<br />But this is a different style/sound. I am actually using Both Delays for Different Things.<br />The Mod on this I found was only good to my Taste with both of them Dialed all the way down.<br />There is a Switch to Select T/B (True Bypass or Buffered)<br />The bypass circuit is only active when the effect is off. Choosing buffered will light the LED; true is LED off.<br />I have this and the MXR Carbon Copy in my Serial FX Loop of my Diezel D-Moll Tube Amp.<br /><br />It almost seems to have a \\"Ducker\\" Mode, where you will not hear the Echos until you stop with Mix Low.<br />This works really well for one of my Originals where the Band would stop and my Echos would Count off 1,2,3,4 and we would come back in. While these Echos are pretty loud, they do not interfere with What I am playing, which is why if seems as though there is a Ducker active.<br />The Delays are \\"Gritty\\" or Harsh as another Reviewer put it, but I love the Sound, it sounds awesome to me.<br />I bought this at Guitar Center, I could not decide on the MXR EVH90 or the MXR Block 90 so I was there to A/B those and to get the TC Flashback for my Secondary Delay. I ended up not being 100% satisfied with either Phase so I held of on that, but I was talking to the Guy about going mostly Analog and getting the Flashback. When I A/Bd the Flashback to this Pedal and the Carbon Copy, I thought the Flashback was too Clean and Sterile, I guess I am one of those True Analog at Heart, because both Phasers and the TC Flashback stayed at Guitar Center and this Pedal Came Home with me. Now... to just find the right Phaser... MXR100, MXR107, or maybe Electo-Harmonix...
