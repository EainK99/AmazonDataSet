I own 4 of these DI's, although I will be buying at least 2-4 more in the near future.  They're great sounding, and they hold up to abuse on the road.  These are my go-to active DI's for acoustic instruments and bass, and they work well on everything.  I've owned 4 for about 4 years.  They get used on a lot of low and high-profile shows without a single issue.<br /><br />Wait, I had one issue.  One of the plastic nuts on the 1/4\\" input connector came unscrewed and fell out.  We found it rolling around backstage, reinstalled it and tightened up all of them, and it was no longer an issue.  But other than that, no issues, ever.
