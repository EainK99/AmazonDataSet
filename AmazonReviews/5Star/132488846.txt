I picked this strap because I was looking for something a little more showy than a solid color but also didn't want it to be some bands logo either. I thought this particular color combo would look amazing with my Deep Sea Blue Reverend Charger. It does look great. However, the color is much darker than what it appears in the picture. The picture gave me the impression that the blue was more on the turquoise side than navy (even though the description does say navy). If you are looking at this strap just be aware that it is darker than pictured. The &#34;yellow&#34; color in the design looks more orange in person, the brown that appears tan is dark brown, and the navy leather is true navy (almost black in appearance).<br /><br />It's nicely made. It fits my guitar well. The strap is pretty soft but the edges are a bit itchy (like a seatbelt). Despite the color not being as pictured, it is a very pretty strap. I'll certainly be keeping it!
