I have had this product for about 4 years, I love it! It has given me no issues at all.<br />The lack of moving parts makes it more durable, because you don't have to worry about parts breaking as easily. I use this weekly on my friday web radio show.<br /><br />It does have a bot of a learning curve at first, but once you have it set how you want it's brilliant. My favourite feature is the ability for you to switch between decks on one controller. With two of these and the mixer component, you can seamlessly control 4 virtual decks, with effects and reprogrammable cue points!<br /><br />Great piece of hardware, and at $29.99 it's a steal (I paid $150 when I bought mine).
