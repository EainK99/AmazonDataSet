I am a Pick Boy fan. I have been using this brand of picks now for about ten years, and they merit the slightly higher price and difficulty in finding them.  The longer I play, the more I find the pick makes a difference in sound as well as effecting technique.<br /><br />These Japanese-made picks have a certain feel to them which i haven't gotten from any other picks.  Not to generalize, but there seems to be a bit more attention to detail. A luxury 'common place item'. Yet, priced nicely compared to the many 'boutique picks' now on the market.  (Yes I admit have drank the kool aid on a couple of those brands, based on forum testimonials, only to find, there was no epiphany, for which I was prepared, but wanted my own first hand experience).<br /><br />The important detail...? I think it is the bevel or smoothness of the edge, and the pick material itself, very high quality, and that is why I pay a bit more for them.  I really notice this.<br /><br />This particular style/shape/size (known as a 346) is one I use both for mandolin and guitar, but primarily for mandolin.  The 1.00 mm thickness provides good stiffness, with a bit of flex, and great attack.  The sharper point allows for good string precision as well.  The plastic seems to be cellulose, and so has a familiar feel, but the edges are, smooth, in fact, slick, which does help with speed a bit. On both mandolin and guitar I find that the attack stands out when playing with other instruments (\\"cut\\"), making single note runs a bit brighter and distinct.  Having used standard tear drop picks for most of my playing life, I have come to use these larger picks equally as often, simply for the ease of grip the larger size provides when playing for more than an hour or so.<br /><br />And I imagine, you are asking, why buy the \\"clown barf\\" color? ( a color description I have heard used or sometimes, rather less amusingly, described as 'mardi gras', tutti fruiti, multi etc., color)<br /><br />Simply, they are so easyto find if I drop one. They never blend in (as do cream or tortoise)and seem to have contrast even under dim or colored stage lighting.  And I tend to get them back if I let someone borrow one, as they are distinctive, and not that common.<br /><br />I think, if you try Pick Boy, you may become a fan too.  No affiliation, just a great product.
