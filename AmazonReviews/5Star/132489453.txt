I'm an amateur singer / singing as a hobby and upgraded from a 'better than average' black PC lapel microphone.<br /><br />Likes / Positive Comments:<br /><br />- Ability to plug in headset and monitor AND listen to songs at the same time (overdub) is fantastic.<br /><br />- (Male) Lower range sounds reasonably rich, with high range more airy.<br /><br />-Sound quality is great, can't complain if you factor in the cost. Easy to use and doesn't tend to pick up too much background noise or static.<br /><br />-Mic stand also seems to be of fine quality (others have mentioned it being horrible, I find mine fine for a 'freebie'<br /><br />- Packaging was welcoming and looked good<br /><br />Dislikes / Negative Comments (Nothing particularly major):<br /><br />- Lack of volume gain control - the headset volume on the bottom of the mic is rather useless and placed in a position that is rather hard to use<br /><br />- No carrying case / bag - would be great to have one, even if it's a cheapo one<br /><br />Overall extremely happy as it solved my problem of being able to directly monitor (hear) what I'm singing AND listen to the music and overdub.
