I read the other reviews both pro and con for these speakers. For my application, I use them on a Bose JS-10 guitar module and the sound is perfect. I get the right amount of bass and treble for my small practice space. So, depending on your application, I believe these speakers are quite a value. They are amount $20.00 dollars cheaper than the standard, low end active monitors.<br />I know they look old school but I think you will be pleasantly surprised with the tone and cabinet quality.
