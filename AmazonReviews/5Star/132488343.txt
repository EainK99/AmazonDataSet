I have 2 of these and play simi-professional. Out of the box you will need to tighten all hardware, replace strings and tune to your favorite tuning. The bridge anchors must be tightened flush to the body before you tune up. The pickup works but is not the greatest. I like the model with the smaller single coil for sound. Overall this is a decent product for the price. A good starter product, and easy to modify for a better player.
