Want flatwound strings on a 6 string bass, then grab a 5 string chrome pack and add this string. Want to setup your 5 string bass E A D G C, then grab a 4 string pack and add this string. The tension for the CB032 is designed for the high &#34;C&#34; tuning. Works great, feels great and staying in tune. Typical D'Addario quality.
