Overall the MixTrack Pro 2 is awesome, I am pretty new with DJing and this was a great beginner board.  Great amount of knobs, sample pads, and everything.  But the only thing I wish was different was that the effect knobs were smooth to turn, instead they click when you turn it so you cant gradually turn on effects it turns them on in stages.  But other than that I love the Pro 2 and will continue to use it for a long time!
