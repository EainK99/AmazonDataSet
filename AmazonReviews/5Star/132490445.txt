I love it because I can take it anywhere.  I recently took it on a trip to the Ukraine and used it in the hotel room and on the train traveling.  It allows me to keep up my playing pretty much anywhere.  I had a small incident at the airport in France where I was told I was only allowed one carryon.  To solve this, I put the guitar in my back pack and took it on the plane.  I usually carrying it in my backpack anyway.<br /><br />It plays great and with the acoustic Vox amPlug, it sounds really good.  I have only one issue with it... while using the amPlug, there is a lot of string noise when changing positions.  I can live with that, I'm using it for practice and I think the noise is mostly due to the pick-up which otherwise sounds great.
