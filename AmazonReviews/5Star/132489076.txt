This little recorder combines fun, ease of use, utility and quality into a product that is a joy to own.  Unlike many other similar products, it comes with everything you'll need to get going.  We are associated with a small vintage instrument shop and use our Zoom to record sound files for customers, select moments from workshops and concerts (with artist permission), and special spontaneous moments in the shop.  All of us love that it is so easy to grab, point and shoot.  With this Zoom in the line up, we can not only share our memories but also show them and hear them in HD.  For this price, the Zoom is an incredible deal for anyone who enjoys capturing memories in a quality format.  Strongest recommendations.
