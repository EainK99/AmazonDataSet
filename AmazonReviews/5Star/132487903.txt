I had a real Yamaha U1 piano and it burned in a house fire.  I could not live without my piano, so until I can afford a new one I needed to purchase a replacement.  This model knocks my socks off!  I am an intermediate player and was looking for a real piano sound.  I am amazed how great it sounds.  The action like most electric keyboards is much easier to play than a real piano but the keys are weighted enough that it is very easy to adjust to. The sound is incredible (I like the modern and bright tones best) and put those earphones on and I think I'm playing my U1!  Even without the earphones, the speakers are great and much improved over older models.  I took a chance purchasing it on amazon without playing it in a store, but thanks to reviews, I was pleasantly surprised.  I did not compare to other more expensive pianos, but I cannot imagine them sounding much better.  Pedal action and sound is much improved from older models and the keys are slightly dulled to make them grippier than the old shiny keys on older models.  I miss my U1 but not nearly as much now that I have this great substitute.  I can't resist playing it whenever I pass by it!  I even think I like the keyboard (playability) even better than my real piano, but I am having a hard time admitting that....
