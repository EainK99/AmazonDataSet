These picks are well made.They allow me to flat pick both electric and acoustic guitars.I find these picks don't warp between my thumb and index fingers after playing awhile.Other thin picks did! I'm basically a finger picker trying to get into flat picking again. These picks are helping me improve greatly. Thanks for a great product! Highly recommend!
