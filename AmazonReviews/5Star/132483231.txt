All of these bulbs are quite nice. All are dimmable, which is something that I was looking for and limits the choices signficantly. All were tested in 3&#34; Lithonia micro-can fixtures in a drop ceiling in a downstairs bedroom. I had 4 LED bulbs and 2 halogen to compare in 6 fixtures. 2 were the Hitlights 5W dimmable LED<br /><br />* At lowest dim setting, none of them got as low as the Halogen bulbs that came with the fixture. But even at the lowest dim setting, you can feel the heat from the halogens. At any brightness you could barely feel the heat from the LED bulbs. At maximum brightness, you can't put your hand close to the halogen bulbs. At minimum level, the Halogens are barely on with a very soft red-orange glow. The LEDs just can't get that dimm, but, the light quality is still very nice. It's a nice yellowish color. The Cree was a bit bluer than the others at lowest light. The Hitlights was the best quality because of the light diffusers. The others you could see the individual 3 chips very clearly and they are surrounded by circles. If you don't look at the lights, it's hard to tell the difference. The Eagle may have been slightly brighter than the others.<br />* At brightest setting, the temperature quality is nearly identical. All of them would be excellent replacements.Still, the diffusers on the Hitlights make them seem the nicest. Looking at any of the lights makes you see spots for quite a while afterwards.<br />* They all fit into the fixtures fairly well, though the fins made them a little bit tougher to install in than the smooth halogen bulbs. The Eagle was slightly more difficult to install because the fins are bigger and more widely spaced, though this is a peculiarity of the fixture that I used more than anything. The cree was the easiest to fit.<br />* At 9w, the Cree used the most power, but it was difficult to tell the difference in brightness between the 9W Cree and the 5W Hitlights, so again the Hitlights has an advantage.<br />* The Eagle has the best warranty, but costs almost twice as much as the Hitlights<br /><br />The Hitlights Durall 5W was my overall favorite, but I don't think you could really go wrong with any of them. I give the Cree and the Eagle 4 star and the Hitlights 5.
