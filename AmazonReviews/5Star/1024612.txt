Purchased this as part of my bucket list in 2014. It was my first ukulele and its great! Great sound, great size, easy to hold and durable. I think its really good for the price: didn't want something too cheap as I wanted quality, but also didn't want anything too expensive as it was my first ukulele.  Didn't feel like I had to compromise for cost or quality with this.<br />I will however (highly) recommend you get aquila strings or any other strings with this, helps tremendously improve sound quality. Strings it comes with are ok but new strings will enhance your experience with it.
