These stickers are really terrific, particularly if you keep your music in plastic sheets. Rather than having to pull the printed sheet out of the plastic to diagram the chord, you can just stick one of these on the plastic and ink the appropriate dots in.<br />I haven't figured out how to get the &#34;free shipping at checkout&#34;, and I would like a tiny bit more room at the top of the tablature to write in the chord name, but I'm ordering them again. All my ukulele ohana want them.
