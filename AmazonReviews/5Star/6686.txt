This is a great pickup . I got mine in a gold finish , normally the gold covered ones are around $100+ , scored one for $50 . I was a little concerned before it came that it would sound too muddy in the bridge of my les paul , but no it sounds great . Really clear, full and smooth sounding without being muddy . I haven't played it too much with a clean tone . But to be completely honest I have never really found the bridge pickup to be good for that in many guitars. For clean sounds I prefer the middle or neck position ... Anyway I really like it's bass response and mids, it gives a good rounded hot sound without being muddy. I guess it's similar to a super distortion but with slightly less output and a little more mids so it gives you a good rock tone that isn't too crazy , and smoother because of the alnico 5 magnet . Super distortion uses ceramic which is a little harsher making it more for hard heavy metal sounds . If you're looking for a smoother, rounder rock tone this is a good pickup . It's a good rocker yet has a good sweet sound
