I was reticent to spend so much on headphones for the office. But my office can be rather busy, chaotic, and I wanted to be able to close out the noise.<br /><br />It does a great job of closing out the noise without the battery hassles of active noise cancellation headphones. So on that front: winning.<br /><br />But more importantly they sound fantastic. So much better than what you'd get for a little less money. It's worth the investment. I'm not an audiophile, I'm not going to nerd you out with specs & buzzwords. There are other reviewers here who can do that. :)
