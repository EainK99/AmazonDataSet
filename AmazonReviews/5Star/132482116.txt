good size for kids. my 6 year old can hold it well and goofs around a lot. she is learning guitar in her group music class later this year so i bought this in preparation. I've played it a few times and the sound is good. The strings really do get out of tune super fast but that is typical of nylon. Also at the bridge the strings are just knot tied to it instead of attached. I used to play violin where the strings hooked onto something near the bridge. oh well. perhaps this is how guitars are.<br /><br />would recommend again as decent price. just be ready to tune it every day. i sort of enjoy the tuning. kinda relaxing.
