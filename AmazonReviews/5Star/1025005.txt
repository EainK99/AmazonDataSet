Bought a 3rd set of these recently, for a 3rd guitar. The first set i bought is still in use 4 years after i installed, still in good shape. The only issue i've had with that set is that twice ( over a 4-year time span ) i've had to put a drop of oil or two on them to stop squeaks. They've held a Les Paul securely, through several hundreds of hours of use. An added bonus is that they are minimally protruding, so that i can just leave the strap attached when i have the guitar in its &#34;model-specific&#34; plush-lined hard case. It's easy enough to &#34;unplug&#34; them if needed, but i haven't once had any of them accidentally detach, or fail.
