Great lightweight headphones. I don't use it to mix my music because I like to hear my bass frequency higher and this headphone is more for vocal and treble editing (note monitoring headphones). I pretty much use a cheap JVC Gummy headphones ($10 at any store) for mixing because its has everything you need and you got to edit your music with what people are normally gonna hear it with.
