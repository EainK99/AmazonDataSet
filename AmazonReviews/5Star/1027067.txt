I loved the cover I bought for my Mustang I so I had to buy one for my Mustang IV as well, and I'm so glad I did. They're light, tough, and durable. If you have a Mustang IV, you know it has an open back. This cover closes the back and protects the speakers as well as wires and gear you may have stowed in the back. Wonderful product!
