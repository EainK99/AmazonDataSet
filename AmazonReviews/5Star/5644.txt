I actually didn't get this case for hardware. This case is so big if you were to fill it with hardware no one could ever lift it. I actually put a rack Tom,a floor Tom, and two snare drums in there.  It keeps my drums safe, and it stacks well in the trailer. As always, SKB  makes the finest cases and has the best warranty. I would highly recommend this or any of their cases.
