We got two of these to protect a couple of inexpensive guitars.  The roads we drive on are awful (lots of banging around in 4 wheel drive) and these have held up fine.  They were a great deal on Amazon too.  Just for reference we have used these cases with a Yamaha FG-335ii 6 string (fits snug as a bug in a rug) a both 6 and 12 string Jay Turser guitars.  They worked well with all three sizes.  The cases seem to be well made and all of the hardware works fine.  Nice lining and cushiony inside.
