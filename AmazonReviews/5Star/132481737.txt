I just got this unit tonight and have been playing with it until the wee hours. I cannot recommend this puppy enough. I made the switch from a Line 6 TonePort UX1 (I know, I know) and the difference is as clear as night and day.<br /><br />I've thrown everything at it: vocals, guitar and MIDI and it handles everything with gusto. I'm especially enamored with the ASIO driver, as the TonePort's sucked and ASIO4All wasn't performing as well as I hoped it would. I've got my buffer set to 6ms and my latency is 15.1 in/21.2 out. That translates to exactly the low latency I was hoping for when I read other reviews; when I hit the key, I get the sound - instantly. It's incredible how much that helps when recording.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze and I opted for the most recent driver from the website and had no issues installing or integrating with my DAW. One really cool aspect to this device is it can read from both inputs at the same time. I hooked up my Berhinger mixer's L/R outs to the ins on the Focusrite and am able to get a stereo mix with the additional control and connectivity afforded by my mixer. Big plus!<br /><br />Oh and noise? Practically non-existent even with my computer fan running in the background. I would always recommend slapping a gate on top to cover your bases, but it's not essential the way it would be with cheaper devices.<br /><br />I'm incredibly happy with my choice. It's even better than I was hoping. And a big thanks to the other reviewers; you really helped make my decision easier.
