It was exactly what I was looking for. The bag itself is not heavy, but it is very sturdy and protects the mixer inside. You can tell it is very well made and durable. It also has smaller compartments for your power cord or other accessories.<br /><br />I bought it for my Yamaha MG-166CX-usb and it fit perfectly. Definitely recommend for anybody who needs to transport a mixer around town.
