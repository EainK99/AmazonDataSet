Item showed up quickly and was in perfect condition. Very easy to install took about 10 min. The sound is fantastic! especially the clean tone. There is honestly no bad setting,any pickup any position of the exg,it all sounds great. There is nothing better for a single coil than the spc, simply great! It's not something you're going to get great metal tones out of, but you can if you put a overdrive/distortion pedal in front of a high gain amp. Where this product really shines is clean tone and gritty blues tones,just outstanding. Whisper quiet as well. Give it a try, it will turn your so so guitar into your go to guitar.
