After a massive research effort to figure out the best headphones that I could buy between US$100 and $200, I settled on these. I live in Hong Kong, so I didn't order them off of Amazon (Amazon really needs to improve their international shipping options. I was able to purchase them in Hong Kong for a similar price and took them home and listened to a couple of hours of music. These are fantastic. They are so comfortable and the sound is so great!
