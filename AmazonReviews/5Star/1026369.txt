These are great for the musicians on stage. The only problem we have found is, when mounted on a mic stand, they are easily knocked over, and with the headphone plugged in, it seems to hit the floor first breaking the connector internally. We've had several occurrences and had to replace the headphone connector using an instructional youtube video. My suggestion is to buy a right angle headphone adapter so the headphone plug does not stick out far enough to break the internal connector. Further, when removing the buttons on the individual channels during repair, do so carefully and slowly as the surface mount switch it is mounted on can easily break or come loose from its soldering. I hope this helps.
