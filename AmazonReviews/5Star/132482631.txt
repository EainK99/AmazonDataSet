If your new to the gibraltar drum rack as i am, and if you have the basic rack with the 24\\" arms on left and right side, you gotta get two of these. I have only got my left side for now but as soon as I get the money I plan on getting another for the right side. I've added three more cymbal boom arms on my left side and it is now rock solid and looks very cool. When Pearl finishes building my new toms i am going to mount them on the right side and have one very cool touring kit. you will not be disappointed in this purchase, I could not be happier! Well maybe if GIBRALTAR would sponsor me and send me an endless amount of hardware, HINT, Hint...Drummer for FLIPSWITCH looking for drum sponsors!
