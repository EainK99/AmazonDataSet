I am an entertainer at parties (Magician, emcee, balloon twister, face painter), and this system is GREAT for me.  The sound is clear and can be turned up LOUD.  The microphone works great, too.  The plug-in sounds better than the wireless mic, though.  When I go to parties, all I do is plug in my iPhone and play my kid-friendly play list for the kids while I face paint or twist balloons to keep them entertained while they wait for their turn.  It works out perfectly.  And when I need to let the whole party know that my time is coming to an end, or anything else, the microphone is there to clearly project my voice.  The other thing I like about it is that it's not that big and it's very easy to transport because it's built like a rolling suitcase, PLUS the rechargeable battery lasts three hours, which I think is great.  I would recommend this to anyone (you can use it for house parties, or parties in the park or at the beach), especially to entertainers.  I'm even going to buy a second one.
