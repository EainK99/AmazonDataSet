My son is a musician and I got this for him for his acoustic guitar.  It is simple to use, just remove the cap, wet the sponge, recap and insert through the strings so that the humidifier is inside the cavity of the guitar.  The base will keep it from touching your any part of the guitar and it is drip free.  Make sure you use distilled water.  He is really happy with this humidifier and it should keep his guitar from drying out and warping.  I purchased the humidifier at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
