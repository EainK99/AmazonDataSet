I've been playing drums since the seventies and  have played every pedal from speed kings to DW 9000s. After one session of playing with this pedal, I've already gotten past  'sticking points' in my bass drum technique.  After making two minor adjustments (beater angle and beater shaft projection increase) the pedal feels nearly effortless and like an extension of my foot.  Highly recommended!
