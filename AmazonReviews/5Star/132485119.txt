This mouth harp is so much fun and easy and calming to play.  You just put it against your lips instead of your teeth like the most common style.  It is not a toy, well made and in a little wooden tube case.  Especially good for me or anyone with dentures or irregularity.  I had one as a child and so did my father,  I wanted to relive those days.
