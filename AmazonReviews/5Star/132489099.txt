If you have been on the search for the best delay pedal then look no further. I can easily put it up against any boutique delay pedal and I still love the carbon copy. I play on the worship team at church and gives me exactly what I need. However, I have played in the secular music market for over 37 years and have been through more gear than I can shake a stick at. Definitely one of the best pedals on my board.
