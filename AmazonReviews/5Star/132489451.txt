It is well made. The case is hard enough to protect from usual carelessness, and padding insid seems to be adequate for an ukuleles  which are not super expensive. My Ibanez UEW10QM EW concert ukulele is a bit too small for this concert case, but I was able to padd the case so that it does not move in the case.
