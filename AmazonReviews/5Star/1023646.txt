I use Dunlop Straploks on all my guitars and basses (let's just say I have a LOT)....  Been using them for 20 years I guess, without a single mishap, without any disappointment.<br /><br />By putting them on all the guitars, I can move a few high quality straps between axes without trouble too.<br /><br />I've used others, for a short while, then went to Dunlop.
