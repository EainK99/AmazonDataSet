I can positively attest to the added longevity and resistance to corrosion of these strings. I play between 15-25 hours per week and if string(s) go unbroken (I've broken one high E) I only need to change out every 3-4 months. The resistance to corrosion part is worth highlighting. Corrosion has a tendency to spread from the strings to other metal guitar parts while also leaving a thin layer of rust dust across the body of the guitar. A wipe down with a clean dry cloth after each practice along with these strings significantly deter such buildup from occurring.
