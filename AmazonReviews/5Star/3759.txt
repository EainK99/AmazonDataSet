I got these to replace a set of Grado SR80 head phones that were nice, but had weak mechanical integrity at the cord connections.  I got this due to the jack that I figured would be more forgiving, and since it came with three cables, if one breaks I have back-ups.  As to the sound quality, you can find plenty of positive reviews for that from folks with better ears than mine, but I agree they are excellent at this price point.
