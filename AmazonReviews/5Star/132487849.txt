I have 2 Sennheiser wireless sets. The latest I bought was the Sennheiser EW 112P G3, I love the way this mic sounds with very low background noise perception. The first set I bought was the Sennheiser 100 G2 EW100G2, but I don't like the mic that came with this set, because it picks up a lot of background noise. I have been wanting to replace it by the one that came with the EW 112P G3, but it's about $140. When I saw this JK MIC-J 016, I thought I will give it a try. To my surprise, the sound quality is as good as the second Sennheiser I bought and the background noise is not a problem anymore. I have being using this mic for the last 2 months every week and I'm really happy with the sound and also, because I saved $110.
