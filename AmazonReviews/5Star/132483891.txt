I use this for when I want to record my voice with GarageBand on my MAC. It definitely has a great background noise canceler and even when my dog is barking, or the tv is on a few rooms away, I won't hear any of that noise in the recording, also if you put a towel over it and record it sounds even better! great price as well!
