Here's a description of the decision process that lead me to the DP-24 over competing products.<br /><br />I've been using TASCAM recorders since the early days of the 244 4 track cassette. I also have a TASCAM DP-008 which is a great portable, very intuitive with a nice blend of features.<br /><br />I wanted to ramp up my recording with higher quality, more tracks, and more functions. I considered  a DAW but the idea of sitting in front of a computer was not appealing to me. My preference is for a capable all in one unit that allows for easy export of tracks and master recordings, so working with a DAW and collaborating with others via exchanging tracks across platforms is still possible.<br /><br />There are other players besides TASCAM and due to the learning curve on these units it's difficult to know in advance what's going to be the best solution. My experience with TASCAM products, particularly the DP-008, has been singularly positive. The DP-008 is amazingly intuitive and capable. So in the end I decided to go with the DP-24 figuring that it would possess the same outstanding engineering that allows for an intuitive work flow without tripping over a clunky user interface. I also gambled on the hope the the DP-24 would have the right balance of quality and functionality for the price.<br /><br />Fortunately I was right on all counts. However, the learning curve is steep on the DP-24. I used the manual which is good but incomplete along with internet message boards, youtube, and my own experimentation to bring myself up to speed.<br /><br />Now that I fully understand the DP-24 and know how to use it I'm very pleased. It can't do everything, but like the DP-008 it has the right blend of features. I think overall TASCAM made the right design and engineering choices. (a techy comment) The only thing would I would add is the possibility of assigning returned effects to the bounce bus. That would be nice but not necessary.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a capable all-in-one recording studio I highly recommend the DP-24. Just expect you'll need to take  time to learn how to use it so you can avoid frustration and focus on creativity.
