I got this with free shipping so it was very worth it.<br />The strings are individually packed in plastic bags and the rest will not rust when I opened just one to use. Unlike Ernie ball, I used only 1 string and the rest rusted in the paper jackets once opened. The sound is very acceptable :).<br />I would buy these again - if there is free shipping.
