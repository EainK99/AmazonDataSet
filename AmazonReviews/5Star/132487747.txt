I have used several pedals, TS9, SD1, OD1, MXR stuff. This pedal keeps up with all of them. It's sturdy, well built, and sounds killer. I use mine to push my Peavey 6505 + a little harder, not that this amp needs it, but it pulled the lows in tighter. I'm a guitarist on a budget, I've learned over the years, 20 of them playing music, that price does not always mean better. So if the price is to low for you on this pedal, go ahead and spend 70 to 100 bucks more, but you'll be missing out on one heck of a Vintage Overdrive clone and throwing your money away. YouTube Joyo VO vs TS9, hear for your self. Keep in mind that the opamp chip in the joyo is upgraded J4558 vs the stock TS9. Most ppl have to get the TS9 moded to this chip. Makes the tone a little clearer if you ask me.<br />LOVE THIS PEDAL!
