I don't know a thing about clarinets but took a chance on this for my daughter due to the reviews.  She loves it, she has rented the past two years and says this hits notes she could not get on her rented ones.  She is in middle school and her band teacher says this is a fine clarinet for her to play during her middle school years.<br /><br />The only down side is the case, the handle broke off in less than two weeks; it is pretty flimsy.  I'm going to contact the seller and see if they can replace the case.<br /><br />(EDITED)<br />I contacted the seller and they sent a new case out to us at no charge. It took some time to get the new case but the communication was great. The new case is holding up much better. Thank you very much.
