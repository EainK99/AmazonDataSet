I've been playing for 20 years, a GHS Boomer guys for 15 of those years. I'm a big Sheehan fan so I figured I'd try out one of his sets of strings. Wow, it seriously makes my bass play about 30% better than it did before, and it played awesome before. I'm totally sold on these. Buying them or all of my basses now.
