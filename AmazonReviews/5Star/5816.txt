Nice sound as a cup mute, equally impressive as a straight, & you can use the cup as a plunger (mine has a rubber seal where the cup would contact on the bell). Versatile, but would recommend a separate straight mute & plunger if needing to do a quick swap, the cup is slightly fussy when trying to remove from the mute, as it should be so it doesn't rattle when you play.
