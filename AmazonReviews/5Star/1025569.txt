Such a cute play microphone for a child.  The stand is made of plastic.  It is not heavy, but it does feel sturdy.  There is a volume/on/off button on the stand which is actually a functional feature and not just &#34;for looks&#34; as many toy items have.  My daughter was able to get a matching guitar and she loves to rock out with the guitar and stand.  I definitely recommend!
