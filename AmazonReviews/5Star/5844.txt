Luis Carpini  has a beautiful outlook and the sound is very soothing. It requires proper maintenance and the quality of the sound it produces keeps improving with the quality of strings put on. The average action and range of the violin is great as well. The pegs are of a very good quality and considering that my violin had to bear the harsh temperature and humidity conditions in Pakistan, the wood really held its own, never causing any issues with pegs turning etc. Moreover, Kennedy violins has been most helpful and responsive to any issues that I had have for instance regarding the setup and so on. I would highly recommend Kennedy violins to anybody hoping to buy a violin that fits him.
