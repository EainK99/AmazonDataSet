My experience with Shure SE215-K and the Bose IE2<br /><br />I have owned the Bose IE2 earphones for over 2 years and had them replaced twice. The bose earphones are okay but after 6+ months they start to wear very fast. The wire had wear and tear 8 months in from purchase date (authorized dealer) and I had to have them warrantied.<br />I still own them but decided to buy new earphones because the quality on the earphones started to die out and then wire got really bad again. This time I was out of luck cause the warranty period ended 9 months ago. I used the Bose IE2 daily and it served its purpose. Back then, I was suckered in by Bose advertising and got their product. After looking at many online reviews, I started to wonder if Bose really lived up to their name and quality. So that's when I started to look at new earphones to buy and landed me here.<br /><br />Please note warranty periods: Bose - 1 Year VS Shure SE215 - 2 Year. To have a valid warranty make sure you buy directly from Amazon.com LLC. If not, you risk buying a non-authorized one without warranty.<br />After reading many reviews and thinking about the price ($100), I have decided to go with these(Shure SE215-K).<br /><br />When I received the product, I was happy to un-box them and compare them to my Bose IE2 earphones. At first, it took some getting used putting them in my ear but I figured it out within 5 minutes. I plugged them into my phone ( Samsung Galaxy S4 ) and started to test out multiple songs. Surprisingly the bass was a lot better than Bose and WAY MORE sound isolation. I had another person compare them and they came up with the same conclusion. They are not super earphones like the 400$+ ones but they do get the job done if your looking for decent earphones.<br /><br />The only DOWNSIDE to this product, in my opinion, is the shape of the wire around the ear. If the wire was just straight down like other brands, I would absolutely love it. This may be one factor to which you may not like the product so please consider that before buying. I am still getting used to the shape around the ear but I believe over time I will conform to it.<br /><br />Also a huge plus to this product is the detachable wire. If you ever rip the wire due to accident or any other reason, you can just buy another wire on Amazon near $20-$30. So after your warranty period ends and an accident happens, you can be sure to stay in the okay. Unlike Bose IE2, which are totally useless now due to my wire accident.ke the product so please consider that before buying.
