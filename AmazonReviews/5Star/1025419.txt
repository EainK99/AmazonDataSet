Prepare to be bewildered when your One Spot first comes out of the box. The condition is temporary, however. Don't panic. Just sort out the tangle of parts and it will soon make sense. You'll quickly find yourself wondering why it took you so long to get one of these things. And how you were able to function without it. Just one caution. While most work fine, a handful of stomp boxes don't play well with the One Spot. Isolate the problem child, remove it from the loop and try to remember where you stashed the original power supply. But unless you're using something exotic or finicky, odds are you won't have any problems. The One Spot is a great product. Buy it.
