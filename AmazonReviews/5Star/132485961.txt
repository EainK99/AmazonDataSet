Excellent sound and song selections. Unit being all black looks very sleek and modern, perfect match with my all black entertainment center compared to other ugly colors. I wish the song expansion card were cheaper, around $80 each? Common guys I dont think thats a very good price, I will probably never buy it unless they cut the price in half.
