I'm very pleased with the performance of this small, very inexpensive microphone. I use it directly into (with an extension cable) my Nikon camera's when I'm making videos. The sound quality is very good and there are no batteries or adjustments to make. Just plug it into the mic input of the camera and go! Much better sound capture of my voice than when I use the built in mics on my Nikon DSLRs and Nikon 1 series cameras.
