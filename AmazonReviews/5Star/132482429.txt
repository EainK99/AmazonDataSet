I ordered out for this microphone to replace my shure sm58. Not that they are good microphones, but they didn't have the punch that I was looking for while performing beatbox. And when I recieved the microphone in the mail, I plugged it in, and boy let me tell you, big difference! I was blown away by how loud the sound was when performing inward and outward snare sounds with my vocal percussion! This mic has a nice responsive diaphragm that not only encompasses the full sound, but also durability so I won't wreck my microphone in a performance. One of my top microphones!
