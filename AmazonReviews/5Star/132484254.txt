I bought one of these a few years ago now...before I discovered the wonderful world of DMX. This thing has lots of preset chases. It's a very simple controller to use...just plug your lights into it and go! I still use this controller in my lighting rig...just not for chases (that's what DMX is for). It's used to light up the spot lights on my bandmates and me. This thing is a tough cookie, and can handle a gigging Rock & Roll band. At the house around Halloween we hook up our regular reading lamps to it to make our house look haunted with blinking lights. It's a great effect to freak out your friends when they want \\"ghost hunt\\". LOL.  :D
