I was extremely pleased with the price, delivery packing and playability of this new fully loaded pickguard.<br />The Kent Armstrong pickups are sweet and pure, the special wiring was professionally done, and all the knobs, and components were high quality.  even the 11 screw holes matched up with my mexi-strat without a problem<br /><br />Fantastic value and huge improvement in my sound.  Adding the 7 position custom wiring gives me added tonality and playing options. It arrived ahead of schedule and was definitely well packed I would definitely buy from Metal Shop Music again.
