I expected less, because of the price, but Yamaha delivered and then some. Comfortable & excellent sound reproduction. I use them to practice playing guitar by plugging them into my amp or effects box. Easy to do because the phones come w/ a larger adapter to fit amps & effects boxes. Light weight & I can hear nuances that I didn't hear on other headphones.
