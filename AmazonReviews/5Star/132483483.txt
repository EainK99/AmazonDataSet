I literally had this installed in less than 10 minutes and I didn't even have to remove the strings, just loosened them enough the slide the pickup into the existing slot.  Swapping out the strap holder with their 1/4 inch jack was super simple also.  This pickup sounds great running through the clean channel on my amp and even sounds good running directly into a sound board.
