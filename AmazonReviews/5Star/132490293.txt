I wasn't improving and I was practicing bad habits. To jumpstart a new routine I strung my budget Hohnor nylon guitar with a set of these and paid for some lessons. My playing is improving! I enjoy the sound of them. The nylon strings are bright and clear and the wound strings are clear and the bass is even. I will buy these again..
