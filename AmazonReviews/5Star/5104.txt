this little controller was purchased as a replacement for a larger box that went bad.  Works like a charm, and due to its size, is really easy to hide away yet still have IR accessible for remote controller.  The remote seems to be standard with most of the other controllers out there, which allowed for the remote from the older box to also work with this one.  All in all, the the price, you can't go wrong with this.
