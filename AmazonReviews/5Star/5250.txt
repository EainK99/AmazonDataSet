I have been very satisfied with Samson's Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone.  Although the product is very small and not particularly expensive in terms of microphone options, I have found records sound in a very high quality way.  In terms of configuration, I use this microphone with my desktop, but given the portability, I imagine that the primary use would be with laptops on the go.  The product itself seems very well-made in terms of durability and I have not had any technical issues with the product on a Windows 8 setup.  Overall, I would definitely purchase this product again.
