First of all this product DOES not come with english instructions, this is true.  However here's all you need to know to get it running.<br /><br />1.) Yes you cannot install drivers on windows 7+ without them being signed, however... some *hacking*.  The best way you can get around this is by downloading \\"Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider\\" and following the instructions.<br />2.) It was kind of a PITA to get working with freestyler, however I watched the chinese video that came on the disc and that helped me choose the proper controller in the setup.  \\"uDMX\\"<br />3.) I also installed the drivers off of the disc, after signing them and they worked fine.<br /><br />You do these 3 things and the product works. I have it running a simple setup for movie poster LEDs.
