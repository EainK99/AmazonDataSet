I purchased this guitar for my daughter. She loves it! the artistic workmanship of the designs on the guitar are quite stunningly beautiful. The wood on the guitar has wonderfully beautiful grain and lovely colors, and the mother of pearl inlays are strikingly beautiful. Craftsmanship is great! The fact that it comes with a guitar stand, strap, picks, etc. make it an excellent value. The added bonus of the FREE amplifier, that we sent in for and received a few weeks later, is truly a huge plus to this package. I would definitely recommend this guitar package to anyone.
