This is by far my favorite brush for everyday cleaning before playing an album. It gets the dust and the static out of the grooves and makes for a great sound. It does not scratch your vinyl like others I have tried on &#34;test&#34; albums before using it on my collection of mostly MSFL and Japanese pressings.<br /><br />There are several of these out there that look identical and they most likely are. I used another brand that looks identical and it was worn out in less than a month. The bristles where bent, the handle did not want to stay attached and it looked very clumpy like it was washed or something. I threw it away. I only use this one on my platter and a different one for deep cleaning. It's made similar , but it has a pad between the rows of bristles.<br /><br />I have yet to be disappointed in any Audioquest products I have purchased. They are pricey, but worth every dime.
