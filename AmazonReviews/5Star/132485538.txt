I bought this banjo after doing a lot of research and found it to be the best &#34;starter&#34; banjo that I could find.  I have played guitar for over 20 years, and I know nothing about banjos other than what I've read, so what I am going to write is only based on initial impressions.  First, I was very happy with the retailer's speed in sending out.  Though it was third party, you would have thought that I bought it through Amazon Prime.  It was package very well.  In fact, it came in two boxes: one bigger that was filled with styrofoam, which helped pad the actual banjo box.  In other words, it was packed for potential UPS abuse.<br /><br />When I opened up the banjo box, the banjo was wrapped in a soft packing material and took a bit of work to get out.  That's okay...it shows me that keeping the banjo safe and beautiful was a priority.<br /><br />The best surprise that I encountered was finding out that the banjo was already set up!  Everything that I read told me that I would need to at least set up the bridge myself, which I was a little nervous about (having never worked with banjos before).  But, I didn't have to worry about it.<br /><br />Since I am just starting out playing, I was able to play only a couple of chords but the action seemed simple up and down the neck and I anticipate this is going to be a smooth banjo to learn on.  I hope to provide a follow-up review once I can work on making this instrument sing.  But, from what I can tell, having been a guitar player for a long time and having been a public school music teacher, this instrument initially seems like it will be a good investment.
