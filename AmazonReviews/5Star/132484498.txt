I really like this tuner.  I actually bought it as a &#34;mute&#34; switch to mute my bass when it is plugged into the main sound system for a large church (1,000+ people).  The soundman would sometimes mute me on the soundboard and forget to unmute me when it was time to play…not good.  Now I can mute/unmute my bass as needed and even unplug it.  It is also a great tuner.  It is dead silent when switching from the live to tuner/mute mode and the tuner accuracy is the best I’ve tried.  I highly recommend this product.
