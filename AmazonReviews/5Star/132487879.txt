These strings are hands down the best I've played.  They last forever and hold their tone for the entire duration.  I probably change them more frequently than I need to, and that's every 4 months or so.  I have practice once a week, play shows at least once a month, and practice every day, so these are not sitting idle during that time.<br /><br />These do not flake at all either!
