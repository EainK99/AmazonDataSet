Not breaking a string during a live performance is the best insurance a guitarist can have. These strings last! They retain the tone quality much longer than traditional strings that collect all the grime from your fingers and also guard against those of us that have an acidic quality in our hands that eat through strings quickly. These hold up and retain tone. Accept no substitute. Just wished that they still produced the bass strings in Polyweb. The Nanowebs are a joke. Bring back the originals! For Electric Guitar.. these are the bomb!!
