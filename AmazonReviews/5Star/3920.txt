I have a 56 Les Paul Jr that I bought this case for and I couldn't be happier it was a perfect fit. The pink liner made a great pic the guitar really popped in the picture.The quality matches Gibson for a whole lot less money. I'm a professional guitar player and a lot of people have commented on how great it looks. A+
