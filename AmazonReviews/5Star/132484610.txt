This isn't a an expensive pedal... People say that you get what you paid for, but with this pedal that is not true. Is one of the best delay pedals i have ever owned or tested. This pedal has really good delay times and is really easy to use. If you are searching a delay pedal but you don't have the enough money to buy an expensive one, this is your choice. I use it with power supply so i don't care if the battery input is difficult to open, actually i don't think it is difficult. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
