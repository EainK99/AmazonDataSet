These are great for the price. The frequency response is very good. I am using these with a Fiio headphone amplifier and am happy with the results. I think one is going to have to spend 3 X this price to gain a better set of headphones  I have used these with the Sony new receiver and with a tube amplifier. These r as good as the other Sony Disc jockey set.
