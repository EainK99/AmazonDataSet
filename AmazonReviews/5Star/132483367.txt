I bought one of these back in 1997 or 1998 and still use it to this day for my Bass rig, very solid and never had any problems the doors have always been tight never come off unless I pull them off. I have done so many shows and have always had this rack in the back of vans, trucks, etc. my amps still look as good as they did when they were new always have been well protected in this rack. I'm buying this one for my DJ company to rack all my amps and power conditioners in as I know it wont let me down. I was really happy to see that Odyssey was still making these and was able to buy it through Amazon. Yes they can be heavy but you can drop these racks and bang them around but they will last and last extremely solid and well built.
