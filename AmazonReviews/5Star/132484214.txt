Excellent and perfect fit for my Takamine G Jumbo EG523SC Acoustic-Electric Guitar.<br /><br />Actually, there was nothing necessarily &#34;wrong or broken&#34; with my original Takamine input jack.  The sodder points were all connected, but for some reason, I kept getting a crackling sound when plugged in live.<br /><br />I've seen this happen before on a friends 414 Taylor.  It could be bad fit cables.  Although, I have tried Monster cables, Planet Waves, generic cables, braided fender cables, generic braided, etc.  I even tore apart the jack end pin and everything was  connected and assembled correctly.<br /><br />I finally got fed up and bought this as a replacement. This was an easy replacement endpin jack.  I've had ZERO crackling cable issues when leading worship at church.  It's been over a year and a half now and still no issues.  Love this endpin jack.  Should fit all standard endpin holes.  Easy soddering..
