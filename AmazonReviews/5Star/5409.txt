I`ve always had to tolerate wrapping excess cord around my hands or my device while I`m running. Now they`re not because the excess goes behind the ear and can be neatly clipped away by the shirt clip. By the way, that also reduces the cord noise because it restrains the cable from actually bouncing around so much! Hope this helped with your purchase decision!
