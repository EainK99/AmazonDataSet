I use this guy for a slightly out-of-th-ordinary purpose. As opposed to using an acoustic guitar or bass with this I use a 36 string lever harp. This box does a good job of transmitting the sound and the EQ definitely helps the sound (there is a noticeable bump in volume where the pickup on my harp is connected, I can't EQ it out, but I can get it to sound more even). The sound is very warm and captures the harp sound nicely, and the FX loop input works very well for those instances when the acoustics of the room are bad and I want to put extra reverb into the signal. If you have access to a PA system, the XLR out works very well and give sound engineers a good signal on the mixer as well as provide you with Phantom Power.<br /><br />My only real gripe with this box is that I cannot use a standalone external power source with it. It takes either a 9V batt. or 48V Phantom power. There is no real way to use a power brick to power this box. For most people this will probably not be too much of an issue, however one of my main \\"gigs\\" is playing in a church where there is no sound engineer and the head music minister will not let anyone touch the sound board (it's literally locked in a cupboard). As such I cannot plug into the PA system, which means no phantom power. In this case I wind up patching into the system via a guitar amp that they have upstairs, and run the DI on a 9V batt. To be fair, I have been using it for 1/2 a year (there abouts)every Sunday and the batt. is still alive after somewhere between 24 and 30 hours of non-continuous battery powered operation, but it would have been nice to just be able to plug this into a power brick and be done with it.<br /><br />Great product, one (minor) oversight. If I could I would give it 4.5
