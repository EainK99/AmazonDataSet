The sound quality is perfect.  The action, in my opinion is perfect.  It is extremely easy to play and very light on the fingers.  You can also take the resonator off for mobility and to take to parks, etc. Or to make it quieter.  It can be good for expressive purposes, as it has an electric guitar whammy bar sound when I move the neck on purpose.
