i have to say, these mandos are great. i have an old gibson F5 from the 1930's. it needed neck and fret work, and i bought one of these for the interim. it truly chops, is well set up from the factory, and, well, i am finding i am falling in love with it....i rarely write reviews, but had to do so. i went to a bunch of new england shops and played mandos from 350 dollars to 6500 dollars, and this one was the best, hands down. about to take it to UK. thanks, debra from lonesome sisters
