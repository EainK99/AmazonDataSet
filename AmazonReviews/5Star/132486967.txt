I read a lot of the reviews for this product before I bought these, and I have to agree with every positive review. The headphones are comfortable. I can wear them all day without my ears getting too hot. The sound is terrific - very rich in all the ranges I can hear. These are probably my favorite headphones I've ever owned.
