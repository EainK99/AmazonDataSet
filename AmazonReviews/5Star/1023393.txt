I have own and played some of the top dollar saxophones, and I find the Lazarro to be a very good instrument. I am pleased with its action and tone.<br />Although I put quality over price in my opinion it serve both price and quality for what I want in an instrument. I done see a need to upgrade and I have more than 63 years experience in playing the sax.
