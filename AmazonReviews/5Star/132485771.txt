First off, I am fully in understanding of the purpose of the ToneRight. It will accelerate the break in process of your new guitar and restore the sound of an older guitar that has been dormant. I decided to try it out first on my Aria AC-80 classical guitar (I did play it first to see if I could get a feeling for the improvement) and then let the guitar and ToneRight sit (on a guitar stand) for the initial 144 hours (6 days). Wow, after I played that guitar I could not believe the power and projection. I kept looking down at the guitar in amazement as it seemed to be amplified. Seriously!<br /><br />Next, I placed the ToneRight on a more higher end classical guitar (I changed the strings first...which I did not do the last time which I highly recommend) and I got the same results. I used the middle setting on the ToneRight and placed the ToneRight as close to the bridge as possible. I just purchased a new Ramirez 1a and after my initial playing I plan on putting the ToneRight on that guitar. A previous post stated to watch the humidity...so that is sage advice. Not an issue for me though, where I live.<br /><br />The ToneRight really works and as far as I am concerned the price is right. I have been a major Amazon customer for years and this is my first review. I definitely needed to chime in on this one. As advertised \\"The ToneRite® is not designed to make a poor instrument great, it is simply designed to bring out the best in an instrument.\\" Put this on a high end guitar and you will be amazed! I am!
