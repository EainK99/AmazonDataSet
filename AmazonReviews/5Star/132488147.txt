I bought this  Takamine 2012 Limited Edition guitar because after auditioning Taylor, Breedlove, and Martin I realized my favorite acoustic sound was coming from a 1977 F-350M I bought in college. However, I was intrigued by the built in pre-amps in the pro level Taks and the reputation of quality that was so ubiquitous. This guitar is a gorgeous piece of work in a piano black deadnaught cut-away body. It has a Cool Tube2 preamp. The guitar comes with the palathetic pick-up embedded in the bridge. It sounds wonderful as supplied, but when you add the Takamine soundhole pickup, it enters another plane of bliss. (See below) The workmanship is perfect and exquisite. The inlay in the fingerboard and the rosette and the spurling is just stunning. I love the antique gold tuners. The guitar arrived with a perfect action and setup. The relief at the 7th fret was 0.006 which is very straight. The string height at the 12th fret was 5-6/64ths on the bass end and about 4.5/64ths on the treble. that is a tight as I get my Tele or Strat without buzzing. The width of the nut is perfect (42.5 mm I believe which is the smaller of the 2 sizes that Tak uses.)<br /><br />The bridge deserves some comment. They are using a pinless bridge where the strings are inserted and removed by pushing through a tight hole parallel with the body. A pair of needle nose pliers are useful to help pull first part of the string through the hole when changing strings (which i have done a few times now). But what I want to warn you about is that you can scratch the hell out of your beautiful black finish if you do not protect the area behind the bridge during string change!! I have a roll of blue 3M painter's tape that I put down before string changes. It comes up easily. Use anything you want, but those strings are as sharp as razors and will scratch upon removal!<br /><br />I am extremely pleased with the sound of the guitar unamplified. I did remove the supplied EXP strings because they sounded too bright and a bit \\"harpsichordish\\". (Which my wife really liked, by the way.) I put on some flat wounds which had no tone at all and were promptly removed and then went to my favorites which are the D'Addario Phosphor Bronze 12s. They are perfect. The action, resonance and sustain is wonderful up and down the neck. It has nice volume, singing highs and deep bass. A powerful strum is well tolerated and yields strong bass and volume if not overdone.Country, blues, folk and jazz all sound great.<br /><br />The real strength of this guitar is found when you plug it in. I am using a Fishman SA 220 PA (a very awesome device) and I have an extensive pedalboard with TC Electronic Chorus, Flashback X4, and Elecro Harmonix Pulsar tremolo (and a wah, Mojo, Spark Booster, Ditto looper etc.) I use the first 3 alot and the others rarely with the Tak. The amplified sound is jaw-dropping. After a few minutes of playing I could see why so many pros prefer Tak for the stage. The sweet, sweet highs. The deep powerful bass. The long sustain. The overtones. I have added the Triax soundhole pickup which is a must-have. (Yes it sound very good without it, but this adds a level of control and depth that just has to be heard.) I was able to use a professional stage the other day because my friends are the sound guys and were getting ready for the new season. They let me bring my guitar and pedalboard and I played through those huge JBLs speakers and Oh my God!! I felt like a rockstar.<br /><br /> The Cool Tube preamp has an extra input for the Triax pick-up. You move the switch on the back of the pick up to \\"passive\\" (The power then comes from the preamp in the guitar I can move from a sweet rock to gentle jazz. . The resonance is exquisite. The bass is deep and powerful. You can dial in the balance between the soundhole pick up and the palathetic pickup and you can also control how much \\"tube sound\\" is provided through Cool Tube. By the way, the CoolTube used up the supplied \\"heavy duty\\" batteries in a week. When I replaced them with Duracells I was upset to see that there was a now a noticeable hiss in my signal. I could make it go away by putting the old weak batteries. I was panicking - the noise was not OK. Good news people. The buzz lasts for about a half hour and goes away when the charge drops a hair on the batteries. I now have 3 weeks of daily use on this set and they are going strong an no hiss. Overall, the batteries will last over a month with a couple hrs a day of playing.<br /><br />I love this guitar. I love Takamine.
