I am glad that I got an awesome guitar at an affordable cost.  It is of high quality in all respects and I enjoy playing it.  Today I got an amplifier and the amplified  tone of guitar is simply excellent.<br />My transaction with the seller was very good.  It was well packed and delivered on time.  I strongly recommend Yamaha FX325 for those who seek a quality acoustic/electric guitar at affordable cost.
