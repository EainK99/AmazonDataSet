Tiny but full of features. I velcroed mine behind the bridge of my practice guitar so I can just walk around with it wearing headphones at 3:00 AM and not bother my neighbors. I got a short 18&#34; amp cord to run from the guitar to the iGTR. Works amazingly well. Try this: In addition to the iGTR, velcro an MP3 player to the guitar and feed its output into the aux input of the iGTR. Use the MP3 player to play a jam-track for you to play along with and you have the perfect practice machine. I love this thing.
