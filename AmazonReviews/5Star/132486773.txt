I was skeptical at first because of the two reviews on here being almost identical so I wanted to post my own review.<br /><br />I absolutely love the thing.  The case is quality and awesome looking.  I put it on my belt and walked around the renaissance festival all day with it bumping around my hip.  Never came loose, never had a drop, worked perfect.<br /><br />There are absolutely no defects on the instrument itself, everything is perfect smooth, and the finish on it is very similar to a rock smoothed by the ocean.  Feels lovely.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the high notes get quite a bit breathy, but those low notes are always completely gorgeous.<br /><br />I have had one of the beads on the very end of the retractable necklace fall off because there's no knot after it on the string, but hey... watchya gonna do.  It's not near enough to dock a star.  It was nice to have on there but it really doesn't matter much.<br /><br />I've received multiple people asking about it, loving the sound.  While it looks bulky and out of place worn around the neck, it's nice to have the necklace on there for safety reasons.<br /><br />All in all, completely wonderful.  I have even taken time out of my night to write this review.  Bravo OcarinaWind, you deserve it.
