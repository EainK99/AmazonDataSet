Chest percussion and vibration (\\"chest physiotherapy\\") have long been standards of care for patients with pulmonary problems.  The medical literature is replete with scientific studies demonstrating the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy in the treatment of individuals having difficulty clearing secretions.<br /><br />But access to respiratory therapists to receive regular physiotherapy can be challenging and costly.  In addition, many patients with chronic conditions find self-monitoring and self-management to work very well and to contribute to improved quality of life.<br /><br />Taken together, Pulmonica is a brilliant solution for patients who understand their disease and want to take an active role in keeping themselves well.  As a physician, I see the potential for Pulmonica to become an important adjunct in the management of chronic pulmonary disorders and the raise the standard of care.<br /><br />Stephen Harlin, MD
