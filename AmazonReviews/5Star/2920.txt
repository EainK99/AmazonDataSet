Decided to try a pick with more substance than the fender thins I was using.  The &#34;Snarling Dogs Brains&#34; is one of the many different  picks I purchased.  They all vary in  materials, styles and thicknesses.  Still haven't tried half of the twenty-something choices,  but for now I find myself using the SDB pick the majority of my playing time. I have them scattered about in easy reach.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to locate with the bright color;  Orange 1.1 mm size<br />Rigid enough for some decent attack plucking<br />Easy to keep hold on and not rotate because it has the raised grid (on both sides)<br />Love the Tin they come in<br /><br />Cons:<br />Keeps me from trying the other picks I got!
