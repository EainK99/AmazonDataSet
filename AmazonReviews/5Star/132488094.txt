I was looking to compose experimental music on my computer, recording various environmental sounds and noise from various objects, and then weaving my recordings into something vaguely resembling music.  Knowing *nothing* at all about digital audio recording, I wanted something really basic at a decent price.  I researched several different packages and finally settled on this one.<br /><br />The Focusrite interface is very solid and clean-sounding.  The controls feel good and everything works terrific. It took a few days for a newb like me to figure out how to make it work, but now that I have it all set up, it's perfect.  The mics feel and sound solid, and the included foam-lined case is a nice touch. The mic stands are sturdy and fold up fairly small for stashing in the bedroom closet.  The cables are sturdy and feel road-worthy.<br /><br />The Focusrite interface also comes with codes for downloading a free copy Ableton Live Lite, and several add-ons of instruments, effects, and samples.  But... if you're a newb like me, just launching the software and getting it to do anything is a very humbling experience.  Imagine someone giving the controls of the Space Shuttle and you'll get an idea of how I was feeling.  Completely overwhelmed!  The videos from the Focusrite and Ableton website were not that helpful (in fact, sometimes they were contradictory), but I found a book, &#34;Producing Music with Ableton Live&#34;, by Jake Perrine, and that has been a **HUGE** help.<br /><br />That book helped this package get this 5-star review, because now I can tell that the equipment is truly solid and the music-creation capabilities are amazing, something that will take me years to explore all the nuances of.<br /><br />If there is one negative about this package, it's the headphones.  The are so light and flimsy, they feel like the toy-surprise at the bottom of the cereal box.  But I realize that for the rest of this package to come down to this price, they have to cut somewhere.  Luckily, I have a couple pairs of good headphones already, so I just tossed the headphones from this package in the closet.<br /><br />So, overall, this is an incredible music-making package and an incredible price.  I would definitely recommend it.where.
