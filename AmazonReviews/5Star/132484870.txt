First off, the heads look like the pegs pictured here: [[ASIN:B00BLY75J8 Ebony Violin Tuning Pegs Set]]<br />as other reviewers point out. However, the ones I got were planetary pegs. The heads look fine on the violin. I'm not docking any points<br />for difference in the posted photo vs. how they actually look.<br /><br />Easy to install (a little bit of careful work with a round filer from a local store). Needs some patience. The pegs are designed to be specific to<br />each side - so, be careful while installing. The accompanying instructions are clear enough.<br /><br />It takes some a few attempts to figure out how to use the gears - pushing in while turning vs. not, to get fine control vs. coarse control.<br />But, once you start using these, you'll not go back to normal pegs or fine tuners.<br /><br />My kid used to struggle with pegs and fine tuners constantly. These solved the problem like a charm.
