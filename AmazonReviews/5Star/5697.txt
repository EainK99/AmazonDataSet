I love this mouthpiece. After I received it I immediately felt a difference when playing in the lower registers of the instrument. The notes where clearer and the horn blew much more freely. On the other hand my upper range suffered for a few weeks as I became accustomed to the new mouthpiece. Thankfully this was only temporary. My range has recovered and sounds as good as ever.
