Couldn't be happier with this purchase.  The workmanship on this instrument is excellent -- a true american classic.  The first thing I did after restringing with my favorite Ernie Ball Slinkys and tuning up was a check of the intonation.  It was spot on.  Not one adjustment required.  Nothing like that classic Fender Strat tone.  Plus the guitar is extremely comfortable to play.  My other guitars are a Fender Tele and a Gibson Les Paul; I love them all equally for different reasons, but the Strat is an ergonomic dream.  While I'll always prefer the warmer, richer, fatter humbucker tone of the Les Paul, the Strat is the absolute champ as far as value goes.  Even at full retail it's half the cost of a high quality Les Paul.<br /><br />One word of caution:  Think carefully about what kind of music you want to play.  For hard rock and metal I still prefer the Les Paul.  You can get a lot of different tones and sounds from the Strat, but it's still somewhat twangy and icy compared to the LP and the sustain is good but can't touch the LP due to its heavier mahogony body.  But it you want clean tones there's really nothing better, especially played through a Fender Twin Reverb amp.
