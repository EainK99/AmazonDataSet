When I started using this shoulder rest, my troubles with TMJ and neck/shoulder tension were practically instantly eliminated. You can easily bend the shoulder rest so that it is shaped exactly how you need it to be. I feel like the extra curve in it offers extra support, which is critical for viola players. I will never go back to the kun.
