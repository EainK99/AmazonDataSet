Even though that I go quite often (every weekend, twice) to deep/ tech house parties And you can see the dj's doing stuff that I'm not able to comprehend, and I'm really awed by their ability, I know that this DJ controller might be a good starting point to start to awe other people. Off course it is not (again) the CDJs and Synths that the DJ booth has, but believe it is pretty close, and you can do a lot of amazing stuff with it. I'd recommend it to a beginner, rookie, expert, everybody...the construction is solid, the quality is amazing, the feeling, the response with the laptop, there's not a thing that I can criticise about this product. Absolutely brilliant!
