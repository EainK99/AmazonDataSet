My trio pianist drives 1 hour to my house for rehearsals.<br />She was not comfortable with the regular bench that came with my Yamaha 5'8&#34; piano.<br />I decided to get an adjustable bench and she and the pianists who play for my violin students are very happy with my new bench.<br />The price is reasonable and it looks beautiful as well.
