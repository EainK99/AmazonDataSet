I play in a big band with a huge library. We rehearse every week and do a lot of gigs, so this is carried around a lot, and thrown in the car a lot. I've had it for several years and it has aged beautifully. Some minor wear, but no torn corners or metal pieces falling off or anything like that. You know what folders I'm talking about with the metal corners. The Pro Tec is infinitely better. This is the real deal and it will last you a long time. Well worth the price. The elastic straps that hold it closed are brilliant and keep your music from falling all over when you drop the folder. If you gig as much as I do, that's when, not if, and this folder has made it through plenty of drops.
