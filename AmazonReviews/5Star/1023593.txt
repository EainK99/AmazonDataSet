Good reeds.  Consistent!<br />I changed from Vandoren years ago.  Too much inconsistency on Vandorens.  2 out of 10 in a box were usable.  With these.  All are usable.  No throwaways.<br /><br />One note: They do &#34;blow out&#34; faster (2-3 months use for each reed) than the Vandorens but, it is so much easier to get one to work for a gig.
