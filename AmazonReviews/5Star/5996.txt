I don't know about the other review on this product, but it is exactly what I wanted. If you want to clean up your foot room, this will do it. Just make sure you have something for it to clamp onto. I ordered the Gibraltar Extension grabber, I think it's call the ultra adjust or something like that. Just type in Gibraltar and the number 300 and it will show up. There's also the 200 and 100 for different lengths and stuff. Anyways l, this product is awesome. Cheers
