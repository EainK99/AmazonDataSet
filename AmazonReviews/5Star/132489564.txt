This is my second Eddy Finn tenor uke (spruce) and as with that one, everything is as described by the company.  The intonation is right on, the action is low and the resonance is great.  I'm partial to Aquila strings as a personal choice for all of my ukes and Eddy Finn has them as their standard.  This adds to the sound quality of any ukulele.  The bamboo is very light, very shiny and very thin.  Kind of looks like a toy but the sound is anything but. Construction is not elaborate but it IS sturdy.  As expected for the price the tuner knobs are plastic which tends to give the instrument a \\"chincy\\" look. Even with that I give it a 5-star rating simply because you can't get this good of an ukulele for the price from any other high-volume American ukulele company (most of whom do their manufacturing offshore).  This is an excellent entry-level ukulele and is a nice size for guitar players wanting to try out the uke without having to suffer the smaller soprano and concert sizes and without having to lay out a lot of money for a good quality instrument.  Its light weight makes it an ideal choice for outdoor activities.  Eddy Finn guarantees their instruments for ten years and that's a rarity in the stringed instrument world.
