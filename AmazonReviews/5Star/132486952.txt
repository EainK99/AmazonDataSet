I've used HIPSHOT Guitar Extender Keys over the years on a multitude of Telecasters for on the fly drop-D tuning- I have to say they work great! Always in tune, never a need to retune at the end of the song. Keep your set list flowing smoothly with this high-quality, simple installation, quality direct replacement for Fender style mini(Schaller) tuning gears. Easy use makes this a must have for me-highly recommended!
