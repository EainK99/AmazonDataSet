I watched the videos on youtube. it seemed like a great little amp. In person, it's just a really great little amp. Very loud, but very good tones. The harmonics sparkle on this little gem. It's small, light, the reverb is just fine to me. It sounds huge, you wouldn't think this little 10 could do it but it does. Plug and play, your guitar and a cord, like the old days.
