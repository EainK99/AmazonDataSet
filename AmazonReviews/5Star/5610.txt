Noise cancelling seems to work well, range is great. Voice calls are clear and music is a joy to listen to with both bass and treble sounding good as well as in between.Comfortable to wear with the silicon ear pieces and even though they are of decent size they stay put rather well. Plenty of adjustment with the included ear pieces to find your perfect fit.Cable is pretty long which I guess is good or bad depending on what you prefer. It is comfortable in that it is thin and soft.Overall these are great, easy to use and easy to connect there is really nothing I can find fault with in these buds.
