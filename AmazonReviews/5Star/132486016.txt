I bought these headphones for my son in law to replace a set that my pup chewed up. He is looking for a carrer in scoring music for film. When I went to replace his set I wanted to upgrade for him and told him to pick out a set (within my price range). He has received these and said that they are an excellent product. He's happy, I'm happy. Very good job. Thanks
