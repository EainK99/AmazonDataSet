I got this clarinet case as a Christmas present a few years back. It's lasted me through three years of marching band, which is definitely an achievement.<br /><br />I realize that things might have changed a little bit since I got the case, but my case came with two straps (the clips were plastic-y, not the metal pictured), a nametag holder, and the case itself. When using one strap, it can be stretched enough to be used across your body, or you can use it over your shoulder. There are rings that allow you to use the case as a backpack. The case has two pockets- the big one, and one sort of hidden behind a cloth fold on the front. The small pocket is the perfect size for a Korg chromatic tuner. It could probably fit a smaller pack of screwdrivers. The big pocket is quite spacious. I currently have a bunch of things stashed in it, like a mouthpiece, extra reeds, a name badge, gloves, and some (folded) music. I've included a picture of everything I currently have in it, so you can see what fits. On the inside, there is a small compartment that can hold five Vandoren reeds in their cases, or two reeds and a tube of cork grease.<br /><br />So far, there is very little on the case that has shown wear. The black color has faded a bit, but that's only cosmetic and doesn't really bother me. The red letters peeled off of one of my zippers- again, purely cosmetic (there's a picture of this)- and the top part of the small pocket is torn a bit. All in all, I think it's hung in pretty well, and I would certainly recommend it.
