Great battery! Mine doesn't look like the one in the item description, the LED is on the front of the unit, not in the switch. Opened up the unit to find 3 18650 style lithium cells, and a fairly loaded circut board. This board seems to function as a balancing charge circut for the batteries, and a low voltage cutoff circut. I cannot prove that it does cutoff power at a certain voltage because I have never been able to fully deplete the battery. It also seems as though this battery does NOT have short circut/over current protection, being I have been able to pull 4 amps out of this battery without the unit cutting out. I have also ran a car head unit with 4 speakers attached to it off of this battery pack.  I do not recommend doing this (or pulling a heavy load)  because the battery isn't rated for high current draws. Overall, great battery pack
