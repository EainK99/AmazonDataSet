I bought this thing on a whim after dabbling with the idea of a ukulele (but let's face it, mandolins are infinately cooler). I wasn't expecting anything more than decent, but this thing rivals several other more expensive mandolins I've played since. When I first got it, there was a slight buzz on one of the strings that no amount of tuning or playing would remove, but all it took to get rid of it was changing the strings. If you're new to the mandolin, make sure you note where the bridge is before you change the strings; it's not attached, and if you put it back wrong it completely throws off the intonation. I've had this mandolin for a year, and the only slight issue I have with it (and I stress the \\"slight\\") is that string cover on the tailpiece falls of relatively easily, so I usually just leave it off. All in all this is a really well-built cool little instument, and aside from the afore mentioned detail, there's not a thing I would change about it. And hey, even if it wasn't that great it's not like you would've lost alot of money in it.
