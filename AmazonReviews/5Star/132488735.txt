I just started learning the button accordion.  I'm taking online classes.  I've been on forums, youtube, asked people who are also learning and the consensus is always the same.  The Hohner Panther is a top accordion for learning, and it is an excellently made instrument.  The Panther has always only come tuned in GCF but they recently began producing it in FBE also.  Regardless of which tuning you choose, it is a good choice for learning.<br />The sound on this instrument is very nice.  Loud, responsive, it is alot of fun to play.  I can't put it down.  The price online is very good.  I have seen used ones listed for the online new price or higher.
