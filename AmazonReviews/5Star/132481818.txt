I've been playing for close to 30 years now, and one thing that continues to blow my mind these days is the value of newer products because of technology and (unfortunately) overseas production. With this amp, you get almost recording-quality effects, rock-solid construction, and total ease-of-use for a lousy $100. I can't even guess what this would have cost 20 years ago, maybe $12,000 (seriously), and it wouldn't have sounded as good!<br /><br />Anyway, great little amp, I can't say anything that hasn't already been said here, all I can do is agree. The &#34;Metal&#34; setting is reminiscient of old George Lynch (to me at least), and the &#34;Insane&#34; setting reminds me of Metallica a la Master of Puppets. IMHO. The phaser settings esecially are good, they could use a little more room to tweak though (but like I said, at this price, NO complaints. None). The clean settings are loud and clear enough to place a small venue. It has a built-in noise-gate also that works well-- doesn't sound choppy.<br /><br />Well done!
