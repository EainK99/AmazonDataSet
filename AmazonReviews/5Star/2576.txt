I'm a beginning violin student at an age well beyond what most music teachers regard as too late to learn to play violin.  When I decided to explore the violin, I checked local music stores for violin rentals.  I found no choice in rental instruments and lots of used violins and bows but no real help in differentiating between those worth playing, even as a beginner violin student (though not to music).  I even checked a good number of other online rental companies as well as reviews of violins made by various makers offered by rental companies.  I finally called Kennedy Violins because they had such a wide choice of instruments and dealt mainly in violins.  My experience with Kennedy, now nearly a one year relationship, has been very positive.  Always very quick and courteous service with respect to choice of instrument, bow, and accessories.  Every delivery was received very quickly and every question answered completely on the spot (via email or telephone).  The terms of my Kennedy Violin rental are better than local stores offered plus Kennedy offered a much broader range of instrument choices.  And every penny (except insurance) that I pay in rental for up to two years can be credited to purchase of my rental violin.  A good reason to pick the best violin you can afford right from the start; always good advice to beginning instrument players.  I give Kennedy five stars for choices in instruments, helpful and objective advice, terrific service and competitive pricing better than some local music stores.
