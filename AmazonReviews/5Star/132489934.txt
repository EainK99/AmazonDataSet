Being a graduate from the University of Oklahoma, I'm swallowing my pride to say that something good really does come out of Austin, Texas. Austin Bazaar sold me this package at a great price and everything arrived in perfect condition. The quality of this kit really surprised me. I recommend this to anyone who is just starting out and wants to get everything you need to get started without having to take out a loan to pay for it. I'm on my way to learning how to play (after decades of wanting to). Who knows, maybe I'll find myself down on 6th street playing guitar for meal money.<br /><br />I've had this guitar for several months now. I can say that it stays in tune and I have zero complaints/concerns. Still recommend this for the beginner guitar player.
