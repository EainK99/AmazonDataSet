This is a well built drum.Head tension is just right for a tack head drum.The head produces nice harmonics and flexibility to adjust tone.Graphics are well applied and since this is a playing drum, it is gonna wear away with time.Drum tone stays the same with graphic wear fade.The one thing I cannot buy ordering on line is the skin thickness.Like wood endless variation.The thicker heads take more of a beating wallop and volume of sound.The thinner heads allow a sweeter tone, and more delicate tipper work, with tone fluctuation.
