This guitar rekindled my long lost love affair with the guitar. It is so much fun to play. It has a beautiful, warm, resonating sound. It's not overly loud, but that is perfect if you just want to practice in your apartment. If you want something louder, then get the kingpin version of this guitar (same thing, just electric). The finish and the craftsmanship is impeccable. I have it hanging on my wall and it's a beautiful thing to look at when not playing.  The guitar looks and plays like a guitar costing 4 times as much.
