Perfect for my needs. I have been looking for a mixer like this for years, and cannot believe I finally found it at this price point. And what have I been looking for all these years? Simply: a mixer that would allow me to mix vinyl and digital, on four-channels, with midi control for my software, and hardware control for filters on each channel. Nothing more, nothing less. Every other mixer on the market either has too much to offer or too little. I'm not looking to scratch records, pretend I'm using vinly with DVS, or dump effects all over my tracks - I just want to mix good music that I know blends well and can keep people dancing. I have owned countless mixers and controllers from RANE, Pioneer, Ecler, Numark, Reloop, Vestax,, DJ Tech, and more. This is what I've been waiting for, thank god it's arrived.
