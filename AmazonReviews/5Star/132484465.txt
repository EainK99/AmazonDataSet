I didnt purchase this guitar from amazon, but either way it is a fantastic guitar with great sound. Its beautiful with great colors and good rosewood material. Its not a childrens guitar, though it could be used for a child it is a travel size guitar. I would recomend this for anyone who wants a light weight great sounding guitar that is a great price, escpecially for a taylor.
