I'm not exactly the most qualified to leave a review for music instruments -- I've been teaching my self Piano and Guitar but I don't have any professional qualifications in the music world. That said, this Capo has worked perfectly for everything that I've used it for. On an aesthetic level it looks nice and probably makes me look like I know more about playing guitar than is true.<br /><br />If you're looking for a simple Capo that looks nice and works well at a reasonable price, look no further.
