So far, I've only been using the U-Phono as a pre-amp for my old Denon turntable (yes, I still have LPs!), and to play CDs and cassette tapes from an old Panasonic boombox, through a Marantz NR1504 home theater receiver.  The hookups from the turntable and boombox through the U-Phono to the receiver were simple - I attached the RCA plugs/ground cables from the turntable, or the RCA plugs on a y-cable splitter with a mini-stereo plug from the headphones output on the boombox, to the RCA jack inputs on the U-Phono, and then attached a cable with RCA plugs on both ends from the U-Phono RCA  jack outputs to the RCA jack inputs for a CD player on the receiver.  LPs, CDs and cassettes play perfectly when I switch the receiver to CD player mode.  The only inconvenience is switching the cables from the turntable and boombox (and remembering to move the Phono/Line Input switch on the U-Phono when playing the turntable or boombox, respectively).  I was able to plug the USB cable from the U-Phono into a USB input on my cable box as a power source; I note that other reviewers mentioned using a USB adapter and plugging into a wall socket.  I downloaded the Audacity software on my laptop (looks somewhat complicated), but have yet to try converting an LP or cassette to digital format (one of these days!).
