I am an 80 year old retired gentleman living on the sub-tropical west coast of Florida. For the past seven years my outdoor travel has been restricted to the use of a motorized wheelchair because I could not walk more than five yards without having to stop for loss of breath. Having tried every nebulizer, phlebotomist, inhaler and other type of treatment that may help over the years, a kind person gave me a Pulmonica less than a week ago saying, \\"What have you got to lose?\\" I decided to give it a try and went on a five minute in the morning and five minute in the afternoon program (maybe a few minutes during the day also).<br /><br />I do believe that there may be a slight improvement in my breathing but that is not the BIG news. I have experienced deep congestion over the years as well as my breathing difficulties, and this is what the Pulmonica has done for me.  When I started using it, it took a little while before I could get the deep low notes to sound well and for me to feel them in my chest.  Then I started to feel a synchronization of vibrations between the instrument and my chest and I noticed a breaking up of the congestion in the mornings. The taste of this phlegm was unhealthy and I felt better when I got rid of it. This has continued, and I have noticed a genuine improvement in my ability to walk a bit further before running out of air.  I also found myself getting up from my desk to answer the door or go to the restroom without my cane; I haven't done that in years.<br /><br />I can't tell anyone one what this might do for you, but I have cut two slits in the leather carrying pouch that came with my Pulmonica and attached it to my belt. Now, where I go, it goes.
