Not sure who the others ordered from or what the issues were, but I've had none.  The threads are fine threads and so you do need to be careful not to cross them and take into consideration that there's paint on the threads.  Just take care assembling and all should be fine.  Bought mine from Amazon.  Works great.  Heavy enough base with a small footprint and the clamp holds just fine.<br /><br />Very happy so far.<br /><br />Note:  Somebody is trolling these reviews and dinging them.  Check it, almost every review on this mic stand has received negative votes.  Somebody really needs to get a life!
