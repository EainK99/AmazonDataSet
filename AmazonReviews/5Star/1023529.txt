Perfect capo for my soprano ukulele.  Clips onto the headstock, and acts like a nice bumper to keep things from knocking into the pegs.  I'm pretty hard on equipment.  Spring is the right tension, so I don't really think about it much.  You could spend much more on a capo, but you probably wouldn't get much more capo.
