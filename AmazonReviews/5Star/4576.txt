I love this little pedal. As stated by other reviewers, the settings allow you to set it up as a compressor/limiter or in my case I set the bass boost so that I can get a nice warm sound out of my guitars that have a bridge coil pickups. Another great thing was that the 2 cables that come with it are actually pretty heavy duty and very good, they didn't have to do that but its a nice touch. I may have to get another one of these and play around with it for my accoustic guitar. .
