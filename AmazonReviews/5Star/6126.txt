Serious clarinet case and bag.  Carries all of my accessories:  3 extra mouthpieces, 2 extra barrels, and everything else like cork grease, swab, cloth, etc.  I feel like I need to put a cloth or thin towel on top of the clarinet before closing the case to hold the clarinet in place...feels a little loose without it.  Lots of storage for everything.  Serious case for all of your needs.
