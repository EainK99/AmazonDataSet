I've been playing guitar for only 3 months now so take this review with the appropriate grain of salt. I started acoustic but frequently exercise on an electric guitar too. I got an OD-3 by Boss for an overdrive effect and decided to get SD9M for heavier overdrive/distortion. I was surprised to find the SD9M can do the overdrive of OD-3 and much more beyond that. My OD-3 moved back into its box and I suspect it won't be saying hello to my amp soon. I can't comment on the absolute sound quality but compared to OD-3, it seems to be at least on the same level. I can mock sounds from almost clean through blues, hard-rock, to thrash metal. So far I love it.
