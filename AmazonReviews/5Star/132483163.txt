Knowing many no-name brands are of very close quality as many well known brands these day, I planned to find a cheap axe to replace my good one, out on loan for a while. I ended up spending actually a little more on this one than I had planned, considering it was competing with a very nice looking Washburn, that played great and a nice mid-line Ovation, with many years of seasoned track record and fame. They were both less. I couldn' help it, the Walden was far superior in my mind as far as build quality, tone, action and value. I picked up a very similar Martin in the $1500 price range and I actually liked the Walden better. I've played  many years and was just impressed with all the features and build level of this guitar, compared to anything in it's price range. It has nitro cellulose finish, scalloped X bracing, solid spruce, etc. You can compare the stats yourself. My only complaint is that while a well made, functioning gig bag comes with it, it offers little to no protection or padding, like many other cheaper brands do come with. You would be wise to buy a good hard case for this and toss the bag. I think as far as fretting, tone, value I believe you will be wise to compare this one in person before purchasing something else in this price point. Excellent guitar.
