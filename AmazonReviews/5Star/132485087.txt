I bought this used at Music-Go-Round earlier tonight for less than ten bucks. It looks like it's been through a war. The grill is all dented up. It's scratched. It's scraped. It looks as though someone may have possibly used it to beat someone with...<br /><br />It SOUNDS incredible! No one is more surprised than I am to hear how crisp and articulate this thing is. I can't say enough about it. I bought it as something to mess around with in the home studio I'm putting together. I wanted a cheap, throw-away mic to mess with until I get paid next week - I'm stunned at how well this thing sounds! It's seriously unbelievable! I've recorded an acoustic guitar and vocals with it so-far, and I'm floored by the performance. It puts my Samson C01U to absolute shame. I popped the dented-up grill off it to record the guitar (tip: the main difference between a Shure SM57 and SM58 is the grill) and I could clearly hear a clock ticking half a room away on the wall through my headphones. The only thing I can think of that would be better than having one of these is having two.<br /><br />About the only downside to this mic is that it doesn't have an on/off switch, but for the superior sound quality it delivers, I'm cool with muting it at the board.<br /><br />It sounds great, and it's built like a tank. If you can find one cheap, get it. You won't be disappointed.
