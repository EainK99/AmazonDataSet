I’ve tried hundreds of sets of strings over the past 50 years I’ve been playing and I started using these about 6 months ago and I think I finally found a consistent “go to” set of strings I can “go to” till the day I leave this planet.<br /><br />The high E, B and G, strings, (09, 11 and 16 gauge), give you the lead playability and feel of a set of &#34;Super Slinky's' with the ability to still pull off full rich sounding chords with the lower E, A and D strings weighing in at 26, 36 and 46 gauge. Also, with these gauges they are still light enough to keep the beginning guitarist from screaming in pain like they do with a set of heavy gauge strings, at least until they get their “finger pads” raised, yet offer that big warm, or crunch sound you look for in a heavier gauge.<br /><br />All I can say is “Try ‘em and I think you’ll love them!”<br />And to make it even sweeter, “Pitbull Audio” offers some sweet deals and they ship immediately! I received mine 2 days earlier than the expected receive date and in perfect condition. Thanks Pitbull!<br /><br />Johnny<br />“No matter how frustrated you get, or how much you just don’t want to practice, or go to a lesson, or… You’ll get through it, so roll with it and NEVER QUIT and NEVER GIVE UP, because you were chosen and given this gift that will always be with you, no matter what life brings your way.
