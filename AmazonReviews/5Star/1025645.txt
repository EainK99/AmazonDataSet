This tuner is an excellent product and it is easy to use.  It works very well with all my guitars, including 12-string instruments tuned down to C and other instruments placed in various open tunings. The sensitivity of the tuner is very good and the tuning results are stable and consistent. The screen is bright, colorful and easy to read. I've had other tuners in the past, but this one is the best. Highly recommended!
