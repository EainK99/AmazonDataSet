Strap looks classy without being gaudy. Like any new leather it is a little stiff but will soften up with use. I bought it for an electric. Very pleased with it. Update--I used an inexpensive (Lexol) leather conditioner applied liberally to the back of the strap and after a little stretching, twisting, and working the leather, it softened up and is now very flexible. The conditioner leaves an odor that goes away after a couple days.
