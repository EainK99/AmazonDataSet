This is even better than the Pedal form of the Decimator ProRack G as it has a filter track setting in addition to the threshold setting for noise reduction. And of course the Mod Stereo version has two channels.<br />I had an incredible amount of noise on my rig due to noisy power line which is also amplified by high gain amps on lead settings, so I need a noise reduction system that does not compromise the tone quality of my guitar rig.<br />This thing does what is supposed to do, eliminate unwanted noise leaving the tone intact. Yes, if you look at it extremely close using a DAW there is of course a slight difference in the tone not very noticeable to the ear. All in all, if you have noise in your rig, this thing will take care of it.
