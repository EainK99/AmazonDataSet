1st things 1st: Make sure you are connecting the MIDI ports correctly --&#62; MIDI In (iConnect) to MIDI Out (your device) and vice versa. If you are not connecting it correctly, the device will NOT WORK for you.  Now for the review: I bought the 30 pin version to connect my Yamaha U1 SH Silent piano to the iPad 3. Connection is seamless and works great. My iPad can detect that a MIDI device is connected even before I power up my silent piano. (Note: Power is required to send MIDI signals over to iPad).  For tech savvy people who are thinking if the connector will work with other adapters, sorry to disappoint, they don't. I've tested both with this USB A Female to Mini USB B 5 Pin Male Adapter (http://smile.amazon.com/Generic-Female-Mini-Adapter-SF4814/dp/B0016RNX2I/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1439346135&sr=8-4&keywords=mini+usb+to+usb+female) and this USB Female to Female Adapter (http://smile.amazon.com/Generic-SANOXYA-Female-Changer-USB_F-USB_F/dp/B000BSN4UY/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1439346243&sr=8-4&keywords=usb+female+to+female) and none works. Nothing could be detected by my iPhone 5S.  Lastly, I tested the setup with an Apple 30 pin to lightning cable --&#62; my iPhone 5S is able to pick up the signals so yes, if you have an Apple adapter, it will work for you. See the photo I've posted along with this review.  iKingdom should make an extra lightning cable and throw it into the pack or sell it as an add-on. I wouldn't mind paying ~$10 more to gain the lightning connection. It doesn't make sense to pay Apple $35 for an adapter just for this function.  I have not tested the USB connection as I have no use for that at the moment, but I believe it will work, given the seamless operation I have experienced so far.  Overall, I'm happy with the product as I picked it up at a very cheap price ($32.xx) and will recommend it to anyone who needs to connect your MIDI device to an iOS device.device.
