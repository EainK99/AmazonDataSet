It was unclear from the item description, but one unit contains two stands. Since I didn't realize this at time of purchase, I now have an extra pair of monitor stands.<br /><br />Beyond that, I've set the stands up and have my monitors resting on them -- it's a sharp-looking setup. I haven't really used them yet (well, haven't used the monitors yet), but the stands do the job. Reasonable price.
