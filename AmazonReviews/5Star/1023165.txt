Hello all just got my new saxophone, and I love it. It is one of the most of the most beautiful things I have ever seen all wrapped up In her white dress. They wrapped her up in a semi see-through white wrap in a black case that gives her the elegant look.<br /><br />  I've not played the sax in years so I'm new kinda New at this if anyone has any videos or tips, I'm all ears. Amazon has been sorely lacking getting my orders brought to my house but for this everything went great. Love my sax, reviewers said to get a mouthpiece and I ddid, and the little I know tells me it was a good idea, the mouthpiece that comes with it, it seems , the air does not flow through correctly when I have to increase the air flow it seems. The new mouthpiece does just fine. Great buy for the price I love it,
