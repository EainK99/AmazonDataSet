Love this tuner. It lights up a really easy-to-see bright green when you are close and then you can zero in with the needle on the meter. Blocks out other sounds which, in my experience, is very unusual for a tuner. Low price too. Tuned my guitar while playing music fairly loud and was sitting right next to the speakers. Tuning was perfect. Buy this little gem!
