I shopped a long time before finding this solution to getting great sound on my videos. First, I tried some  poor quality $6.00 jobs. Not surprisingly, they arrived with clips that were broken. What good is a lapel mic that doesn't clip? Then I considered some really expensive options worth over $200. GULP! Thought I'd give these Audio-Technica ATR-3350 a try. My son, who is in the sound tech industry, likes this brand. The sound was crisp and clear. Makes my video commercials sound professional. Very pleased with the quality and price.
