I was looking for a smallish bag for a micro 4/3 and a couple of lenses (none long),plus the usual items (filters,cards,batteries,etc.).Though I like sling bags,I couldn't match size and function.I have a Tenba bag for stands,and liked it,so I thought I'd try this small shoulder bag.I was very pleased to find the quality of this bag,and its features.Hardware is excellent and the straps are generous and sturdy.The top opening has a sealing zipper that I've not seen before.I have other weatherproof bags that rely on welting to cover the zipper,but these tend to snag on the corners. There is an alternate fastener to use if the zipper is too slow to open.Side and front pockets are useful,and there is a built-in card slot array as well as two tethered nylon card safes,and AA battery loops.On either side,there are straps for attach accessory carriers,and straps on the bottom for a tripod.Under the main compartment is a waterproof cover,and on the back is a place for an ipad and if the bottom is unzipped,it will slide unto a wheeled case handle.Great,thoughtful features in a useful small bag.I should mention it is well-padded. It could use another divider (I have a few of those from other bags),and it is a little on the heavy side,but all things considered,it's one of the best-designed and constructed bags I've used.
