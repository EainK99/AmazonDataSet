And I surely didn't get wrong. As I began to read the description about this guitar I took attention only to the part talking about how wounderful sound it has and how many others sounds you can create with this guitar. I read only that it was an acoustic and electric guitar, so I decided that it could be the guitar I needed. So I just bought it.<br />When it arrived a had a wounderful surprise: what I didn't know (maybe because I didn't read it) was that this guitar had been shipped in a wounderful black hard case with all the hooks to close it gold colored.<br />Too expensive? NO, no really for a guitar like this and also its case.<br />But ... I had the change to play it only as a classic guitar because the seller is been not so carefull to control, before to ship it, the status of the guitar, if it worked, if there were enclosed the 9v battery and the manual. So I had to return it.<br />Anyway as soon as I could I'll buy another one, because if it has this amazing sound only as classic giutar I can't really imagine as acoustic and electric guitar...<br />For everybody loving very good music: it doesn't matter if beginners or professionists.<br />Belive me: don't loose it !!!
