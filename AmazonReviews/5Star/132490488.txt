I've used several different brands of cleaners but I will say that I'm most impressed by what the Gerlitz kit does.  The microfiber cloth is very 'fluffy', the wax does a great job, and the smudge remover does a good job (just make sure you wipe all the overspray too).  The guitar honey is what I bought this for and it did not disappoint.  It really brought the fretboard on my electrics back to life (and the wood around the saddle on my acoustic too).  The stuff is gold to me.  For the value in the package, this is a definite 5-star.
