I just received my Cordoba GK Studio. Great guitar.<br /><br />Fit and finish are excellent.  The quality of craftsmanship seems to be right-on.<br /><br />The tone is great. Far better than any other cutaway in its price range.<br /><br />Playability is good right out of the box.  A bit lower action than most classicals but high enough that I have zero buzz on any string at any fret.<br /><br />My only two criticisms would be:<br />1) The electronics control panel on the top of the side.  I just never like the look of the that sort of thing (it is common n cutaways)- but the trade off is a built in tuner.<br />2) Hard case should be standard - or no case and lower the price so you can put the $ towards a hard case. The gig bag is a very nice gig bag but not nice enough for this guitar.
