If you don't have $40,000 to spend on a control surface like Avid's new S6, which utilizes the same protocol to talk to your DAW as the Artist Series, I think you could DEFINITELY do worse than an Artist Mix.<br /><br />I'd say they are ideally suited for smaller studios/project studios as you can customize your setup to whatever you want.  2 Mixes and a Control, a Control and a Transport, maybe some of each or multiple Mixes together.  As long as you have an Ethernet hub, you can daisy chain these suckers until you're blue in the face.  But, personally, I think that would be overkill since you can move through your session 1 or 8 tracks at a time using the &#34;nudge&#34; or &#34;bank&#34; keys, so, unless you REALLY need more, you shouldn't need any more than one.<br /><br />I mean, yes, it IS still a little pricey in my opinion, but it definitely does everything it says it does and then some (you can probably find other unique uses for it...I have).  But compared the the Euphonix version, this thing is much, much better.  Better construction (it has some weight to it), the black scheme is very attractive, the faders and knobs are HIGHLY touch sensitive.  The resolution of EuCon compared to MIDI is immediately noticable.  I've found that it very, very deeply immerses you in your Pro Tools sessions.<br /><br />I would say that if you don't do A LOT of audio work, or you typically don't utilize very many tracks, or you aren't doing more complex operations that need simultaneous interface with what's going on in your DAW, you probably don't need one of these (although they are definitely cool to have anyway).  But for semi-pro engineers, or home studio owners (maybe even large studio owners) these things seem to be very, very good.  There's a little bit of a learning curve, but it's not horribly convoluted.  I'd recommend them to anyone looking into buying one.  I love using mine.
