After my husband's knee replacement surgery he was given a plastic bottle apparatus with an attached hose to blow into to keep his lungs clear. Boring! There is also an assortment of other dreary breathing exercisers available. But the Pulmonica is fun and you can immediately feel the resonating vibration in your lungs. And as we start to enter our twilight years, what a wonderful way to exercise both your lungs and your inner harmony.
