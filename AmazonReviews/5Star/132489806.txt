I am very pleased to have this oval hole type mandolin which gives a much different sound than an A or F design.  Not drastically different but a rhythm of resonance that's unique to the oval hole type.  Even looks like it has an adjustable neck based on the cover on the head stock.  The action was set at a very low position from the get go and makes it play very smoothly and surprisingly no buzz anywhere on the frets.
