I use it with my MacBook Pro Retina 15&#34; and GarageBand recording software to record a small group Bible study in conjunction with the Shure MX393/O condenser mic. The phantom power feature is essential for this mic, so this adapter is perfect for both powered and phantom-powered mics. Definitely recommended.
