We had a Baby Grand Stienway and this Yamaha key board is so close to that sound and the feel of weighted keys that it is hard to believe.  My wife loves it and our grand kids do too.  My son is a musician and he recommended a lesser variation of this Yamaha model but when you get this one, you get much more for the money.  He was suprised and agreed this was the one to get.  We also got the foot pedal, bench seat and a few other related goodies besides the keyboard stand, the JVC headphones, dust cover and power plug in adapter that came with the keyboard.  Here's the beauty of it all; if you don't agree - send it back to Amazon.
