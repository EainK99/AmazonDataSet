I bought this to replace my nut on a 12 string guitar (i bought thru Amazon).<br />I did so to make my 12 string into a workable 6 string & it worked out well.<br />I like a wide nut/neck for my big hands when playing guitar.<br />This nut fit perfectly as far as the width & thickness & I only needed to place a little a shim underneath it first before gluing it onto my 12 string guitar.  Other wise it was perfect.
