bought these because i desperately needed a new set of reeds and didn't have much money, and for the price they are very very good, they require you to know how to use and maintain drone reeds well however, these are the traditional style cane reed afterall. the tone is fairly decent though the cane is cheap but for this low price? an absolute steal, just know what you are doing when you pick em up, cane is very tricky to use
