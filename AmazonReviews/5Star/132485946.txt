I am a old (60+) beginner that just wants to enjoy his retirement and I thought learning to play would be a good use of my time so I researched guitars and settled on this package. Everything that came in the package worked fine, the strap can be adjusted to fit most anyone (I'm 6ft and still have about a foot of adjustment in the strap), the tuner is easy to use and the picks are nice. The video is mostly useless but I didn't expect much from it anyway and there are a number of sites on the internet where you can get free beginner training. ( I like justinguitar.com).<br />As to the squire/fender guitar I really like it. It appears to be a good quality product. It looks really nice and sounds as good as anything I have heard on the internet at double the price. If you are interested in a good guitar to play at a small price this is for you.
