I was a little skeptical when reading some of the reviews about these strings, but I decided to buy them anyway. I have an Oscar Schmidt Aloha Baritone Uke. These strings have a much more full and beautiful tone than the strings that came with my uke. Once strung, they took awhile to stay in tune, as all new strings do, but after a day or two, they remain remarkably in tune. I'm very pleased, and will be buying another set of these next time I need strings. Highly recommended!
