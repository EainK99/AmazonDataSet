I use Rotosound strings on all of my guitars- everything from the Standard American P-bass to an old Japanese Univox, and regardless of age or quality, they make all of them sound incredible. I use the Swing Bass 66s on my basses and British Steels on my guitars because I love a bright, punchy tone, and these strings deliver in spades. They tune quickly and stay put from the get-go, and they last forever.
