Got this for my son for his birthday.  He really likes it a lot.  There are a ton of different instruments and sound fx along with some great beginner songs to play.  The headphones are not of the greatest quality, they're noise reduction or studio quality,  but then again they never claimed to be either.  They work great when you don't want to hear the keyboard and they are strong enough to take a beating from a six year old.
