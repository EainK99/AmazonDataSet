This bowl is just beautiful and the perfect size. Easy to play & the sound is nice. I got it singing within a couple minutes after opening. Very crisp sound. My fiance and I have gotten a bit addicted to playing it. I will be using this bowl as a way to get my student's attention in my classroom. I anticipate they will all want to try it out for themselves!
