I have been a fan of the Engl Fireball sound from the first time I heard it....For a great demo of the Engl sound check any \\"Fearedse\\" vid on y*u tu*e..Ola demos them out so that you can judge how Engls sound in a metal setting.....Since I can't afford a head at this time...thus my purchase and review here..<br />I got the pedal quickly after order and it was packaged nicely.<br />It comes with An instruction sheet covering the basics and in/out mappings.<br /><br />The following review is based on the E1 going thru an MAudio Fast Track pro into Reaper and mostly through a set of Audio Technica ATHM50 headphones...( I do not own a head at this time and my combo is loaned out..I did try it through my rack..which I'll cover at the end)<br /><br />It totally sounds like you have an Engl amp....The cabsim output is really good and gives you an excellent sound to begin with...(we all will work our \\"magic\\" into the sound with the eq tweaking and fx in your DAW)..I had a smile from the first chunk. The EQ knobs all had a noticeable effect on the overall sound and interestingly on the sizzle/definition end of the distortion itself. The low mid girth is well defined if EQ and levels are dialed up...obviously your ideal sound may be different than mine but I am saying you can find it with the E1. The gain level is well suited to what you're looking for in this pedal. You can dial up screaming trebly gain or fuzzy upper mid with chunk...the low mid response is exactly the Engl chunk you'd want in the E1. The simple way is start with all the EQ's and gain set at about 5 1/2 or 6....It sounds really good and chunky going into Reaper.<br /><br />The one thing I can tell you and why you should spend the mere $120+ is....this pedal will blow your mind if you use a Recabinet 3 VST plug in! (I would think any >good< cab sim would work as well)....Using the E1 line out into Recabinet rather than the pedal's cabsim out is waaaaaay better! I couldn't believe how great it sounded! It almost didn't matter what Cab/Mic combination I used, I was loving the sound. The E1 with the \\"Eagle\\" cab and MD421 mic was phenomenal! EXACTLY what your looking for in this pedal.<br /><br />As noted above I did not have the option of plugging this into a head/cab combination but I did run it through my rack (E1>ALESIS Q2>BBE422>Marshall 900 Series 100w Tube poweramp>2x12 cab w V30's)....The funny thing here is that I thought the cabsim out into the 2x12 was better than the line out..although not in any way am I saying the line out was bad.it was fantastic as well. I just like the chunk/definition it had...In short it is just the coolest Engl Fireball sound starting point point that costs less than 10% of the Fireball 100 head!
