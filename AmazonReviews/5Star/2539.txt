I was very skeptical buying this. I played all through high school and wanted to get back to playing. There were so many issues with my old sax, so it made playing very frustrating. Obviously, I don't want to spend thousands on a top of the line sax not knowing if I will stick with it. This has better sound than the old Yamaha I've had for years. Even if it only lasts a couple of years with consistent playing, it was worth it to not spend a small fortune on one right now.
