Love the way it looks. The plexiglass top gives it a very smooth, clean look. The different MODs on top of the Clean-signal knob make the pedal very versatile. You can have a high-gain sound for hard rock or even a lighter, bluesy sound by turning up the clean signal, similar to a vintage Tubescreamer pedal sound. This is definitely my go-to pedal for my distorted guitar sounds.
