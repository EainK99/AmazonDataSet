I built this amp last year, added a second speaker jack, a bright switch and a simple \\"voicing\\" three way switch straight from Dave Hunter's Two Stroke amp project. You can find it in his book \\"The Guitar Amp Handbook\\" which I also highly recommend. I own and have gigged several Fender tube amps including a '65 Twin Reverb reissue, a Vibrolux 'Custom' and a Hot Rod Deluxe, and this amp beats them all for sweet, beautiful clean tube tone! I use a Tube Screamer as well as a couple of custom built OD pedals for overdrive because this 60 watt amp has to be pushed hard to get it's natural overdrive, and most clubs don't like that volume level. I've used a custom Strat w/twin rails type pickups, and it breaks up at a more reasonable volume, but with lower output guitars (which most of mine are), it needs the pedals. I also get reverb and trem from pedals. The amp is a relatively easy build , taking a couple of evenings, and was easy to mod with the included parts. A simple design issue (which wouldn't bother most players, but bugged me) was quickly addressed by their tech support people and easily fixed when I did the voicing switch mod. I run it with two 1X12\\" cabs w/a Celestion in one and an Eminence FSD in the other.<br />More mods are planned, but this amp was a keeper right from the start. Highly recommended if you are comfortable with a soldering iron. And get Dave Hunters book too. Lots of useful info on design and parts selection when modding this amp...or any other, for that matter.  Home run for MOD Kits!
