Not seeing a lot of choices here and this may be the only unbalanced RCA (single center conductor) crossover available in this price range.<br />Plenty of the xlr type, but then amps with xlr connections would be needed.<br /><br />The frequency control knob range is 50hz - 2,500hz high/low so typical applications are:<br />* Home HiFi - Woofer & Tweeter<br />* PA  - Woofer/Horn Tweeter (Identical power amps will provide the best results, btw)<br />* 2.1 satellite speakers with existing passive xo's. The Low and High would be used and not the mono sub out.<br /><br />The mono out is the only bell and whistle that I see, which would typically be connected to a sub plate amp (or similar) that has separate low frequency & level controls.<br /><br />I was a little worried this was another glorified &#34;car crossover&#34; with new case and 12 volt power adapter, not here, this little box is whistle clear and my tweeters never sounded better. The fast set up is great, however be very careful not to connect &#34;low out&#34; to the amplified tweeter. There won't be any second chances and can toast a tweeter winding in a second or two. That said, designing, testing and the costs involved for passive crossover boards is a nightmare for the non-engineer. As they say - Go Active Man!!<br /><br />Update: As mentioned the polarity is reversed Low-High; my unit is &#34;backwards&#34; so you'll want to check that by ear or mic testing.<br />[EDIT] After using this xo in several applications I discovered the polarity is not reversed, but has more to do with the speaker selection.<br />Would need a sound engineer to explain this phenomena, but anyone can test a speaker phase with computer/mic and free speaker testing download(s).<br />The image below is out-of-phase, so drastic, any computer mic will show the huge dip in the response.
