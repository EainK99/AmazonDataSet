I'm writing this from the perspective of getting this amp to fill a specific need; we started a praise & worship band at church, and I needed enough clean headroom to keep up with the drum kit. This amp does just that. It's also incredibly versatile, and will get all great Marshall Tones. Even in the second channel I can get fairly nice tones with just a little break-up.<br /><br />I'll add that for my purposes this amp is great at home too. The clean channel won't blow your ears out in the Triode Mode unless you dime the gain. Also, I found that unlike other reviewers, I found the reverb to be perfectly adequate. But I will add that I tend to use reverb sparingly. I'm not looking for the Sistine Chapel, just a touch of depth. For a room the size of a smallish bar and up it's just fine.<br /><br />I'll also say that compared to what I was using before at church (a Fender Frontman 25R), this has much more versatility, and it doesn't have that thin, solid-state-practice-amp vibe. I'll admit that I am biased towards tubes, but I've found that tubes just have more potential for complex harmonics and full, belly-filling 'Oomph.' This has been my experience with my collection of smaller, boutique tube-amps. Some have complained about the speaker, but it sounds fine to me. I'm not a tone snob though, and I do wear hearing-aids, so I may not be the best guy to ask.<br /><br />This is a versatile piece of kit. Moreover, It's not so expensive that I'll break my heart when it gets a little beat-up from getting hauled from my place to the church. This amp survived the UPS terminal near my house, so it will survive anything. I've got another Marshall that was made in Milton Keynes and this is just as well made, as far as I can tell.
