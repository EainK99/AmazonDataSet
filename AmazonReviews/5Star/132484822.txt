I bought this as a gift for my husband who is a beginner with the guitar, but I have to honestly say when it arrived in the mail I opened it and started laughing.......I thought you have GOT to be kidding me.....it is very small and I was shocked by how tiny it is but really for $20 what could anyone expect? Anyway, although this thing seems tiny it does have a good sound. I was surprised by its mighty output! I don't think you could go wrong with having this as a practice amp. Its easy to carry because its so small and would be great to haul around without the heaviness. Again, for $20 what complaints could you have.....it works, does as it should and its compact for mobility......a good buy for the price.
