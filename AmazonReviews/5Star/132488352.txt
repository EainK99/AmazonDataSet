I bought these LED lights a few months ago and put them on my friends subwoofer box, hooked 'em up to the microphone music controller, and was amazed! The white light is truly white, unlike cheaper LED light strips. I have zero complaints about these lights as they performed so well. Then my friend hit a tree and demolished the sub box. We took the LED's off and, just to see if they still worked, hooked them back into the controller and powered it up. I was astonished to find out they still worked! I guess I can add durable to the list of complements about these lights. The adhesive backing is really strong and will pretty much stick to anything, which is very helpful on a subwoofer box.<br />These LED lights feel cheap, but they are the best light strips I have found on the market. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants to add nice background lighting to just about anything.
