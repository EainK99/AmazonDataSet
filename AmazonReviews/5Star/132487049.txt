Firstly, it was on sale for $799 which I totally don't get. New. For a super short time. I was looking at the 2013 Charvel SoCal Pro Mods. They were actually more. So it was a ridiculously good price for what I got.<br /><br />Secondly, I have a 2008 USA made San Dimas. It's great. But I actually like this Chinese made EVH better. I think they've moved production to Mexico which may be the reason for the price blow out. However, this guitar rules. Sounds great clean and dirty. The neck is great. The smaller frets are great. Might take some getting used to for somebody used to jumbos but I'm a fan of the smaller, stainless steel wire.
