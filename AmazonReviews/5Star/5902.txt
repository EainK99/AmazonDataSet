I wanted a small set of hi-hat cymbals just to use in my home teaching studio with a cocktail kit. These are small cymbals, and as such don't have as satisfying a sound as 13 or 14 inch pairs would have, but for what they are, they sound great. This is my first experience with Istanbul Cymbals, and so far I'm very pleased with the value of this product for what I spent.
