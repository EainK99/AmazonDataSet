We are very pleased with this purchase.  Bought this for our daughter who just started taking piano lessons.  Very good beginner keyboard. All accessories were included as stated in the description.  Keyboard stand is sturdy, and the only drawback is the keyboard does want to slide around a bit, but since it is a &#34;universal&#34; stand, not completely surprised.  Not un-useable however.  AC Adaptor is the correct one and works fine and the headset came with the needed adapter and works great as well.  Very, very please with purchase.  Packaged very well and shipped very quickly.  Great value and excellent keyboard!!!
