I'm only using this for the firewire and digital in/outs.  I use a SEKD 2496s converter with GT Tube Brick and Mackie VLZ Pro pre's going  straight in via digital spidif.  I record at 32 bit float 96 khz and the quality is amazing.  For $80.00 this was a cheap way to talk to my laptop and hook my existing gear up.  The solo locks to my converter in seconds and locks quicker than my original SEKD card did so pretty happy about compatibility.  My software corrects latency so this has worked out great!  If your on a tight budget like I was this is a way to go.
