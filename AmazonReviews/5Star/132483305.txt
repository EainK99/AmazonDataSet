I play professionally and so need an array of mallets and beaters for orchestral and session work. Bought the Zildjian mallets because I use their cymbals. I have been very pleased with the mallets because of their weight, they are heavy enough to crescendo quickly but are easy to control. If you need to create suspended cymbal rolls you will like them. Not really suited for playing on the drums themselves.
