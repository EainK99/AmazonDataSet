Ukuleles are hot right now with the youngsters. I don't know why, but they are. My daughter was determined to teach herself to play one. She asked for this one for her birthday from Grandma. She has one 30 minute lesson, and with that and YouTube videos she is teaching herself to play! She can actually play recognizable songs after 3 months! Her prior music experience was playing the recorder in 3rd grade.<br />This ukulele is lightweight, easy to tune, and came in a zipper case. It's exactly what she was looking for!
