Came fast, well packed and nice materials.  Read the instructions till you are thoroughly confused and then throw them away.  They were written in Japanese , translated to Hindi, then Navaho and finally English.  Something was lost between the designer and the final printing.  I am a professional woodworker, i assembled it so it works....and was fortunate to have proper clamping tools etc.  It sounds great, sturdy enough to sit on and looks terrific having been finished with a good sanding sealer, clear lacquer coats, a Vintage Amber wash and satin clear lacquer top coats.  Don't let the wacky instructions put you off.....but don't take them too seriously either.
