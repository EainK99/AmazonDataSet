This keyboard bench is very nice addition to your music room or studio. Money well spent. Look no further.<br /><br />* comes out of the box pre-assembled.<br />* intuitively easy to set up and I bet you can do it in less than a minute.<br />* very comfortable bench (thick foam)<br />* nice coverage (width and depth)<br />* feels sturdy and solid (doesn't rock)<br />* looks nice (quality is there- paint finish, seat finish, adjustment knob)
