This replaced an old Shure wireless set at our church. This is a far superior product. Much better microphone, much cleaner sound, much less interference.  The hardware is better designed as well. Compact. A straightforward single on and off button outside. (In contrast, the Shure had a confusing two button combination of &#34;power on and off&#34; and &#34;mute on and off&#34;, which managed to still confuse people after all these years.)  Battery compartment is easy to access. Settings inside the battery compartment are intuitive. It even stores a small tool for making the adjustments. The tool comes handy because you don't always have a screwdriver with the right size at hand.  Only one issue: The microphone head comes off the clip too easily.  The first time we used it, the speaker touched the microphone, and it just came off to cause a badly timed interruption of the message. Afterward, we just used super glue to permanently fix the microphone head to the clip.  The clip is really not a good design at all. It is just a loose sleeve with no fastening mechanism. They should change it.
