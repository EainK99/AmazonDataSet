This guitar is just the right size for a 6-7 year old girl. I bought it for a Christmas present to fulfill a &#34;wish list&#34; for a friend's daughter. My husband and I both play, and we were impressed with the quality of this instrument. It comes with a strap , case, tiny little amp and a pick. It works in a full sized amp also, because we tried it and tuned it up to see how it sounds. It's really nice for it's size and price.
