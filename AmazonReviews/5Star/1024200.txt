After Mark Bunney gave one of his legendary concerts, my wife (in her fifties...) decided she wanted to learn to play the sax. So I bought her the set, even though thinking, she might give up after a few weeks (we aren't exactly what you'd call musically gifted).  She started off practicing ... I had to endure the odd sounds. After three month she gave a first &#34;public performance&#34; playing amazing grace at a church event. And only a short while later she started accompanying church singing every week (we are a small church - no piano player, no organist). She loves it, the church loves it ... and she stuck with it (ready to start her third year) and I gladly &#34;endure&#34;. If that isn't motivation and dedication, I don't know what is. :-)  Mark Bunney has a gift to motivate - and asks learners to dedicate. And the results ... I wouldn't have thought possible, if I didn't hear it myself.<br />The method is somewhat unorthodox (you don't have to be able to read notes), the exercises can appear tedious at times, but the success is convincing. Mark seems to know what he is doing - and even is available over Skype if you need some personal assistance.
