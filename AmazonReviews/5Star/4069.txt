Its not just hype! I finally decided to buy one of these and it was shipped to me within 18 hours.....which is creepy fast. The install was done by a luthier and it is nothing short of perfect! I have played guitar for 35 years or so and always hated acoustic electric guitars because of the lack of authentic sound; the K&K Pure Mini has changed all of that! I love the sound and the dynamic headroom is simply off the charts. Feedback is basically zero or 100.... In other words, as long as you keep to a particular volume or distance from monitors you wont be surprised by feedback. If you get in the feedback zone simply back off and settle into an area and play all night long after that. Amazing product and creepy fast shipping. I mean 18 hours from around the Philadelphia area through customs to Canada and to my door in a small town? All Good!
