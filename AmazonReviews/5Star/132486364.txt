We purchased this little Djembe because it looked like the best quality for the best price, and we bought it for our little, soon-to-be percussionist, who's only 9 months old, and it's perfect!  Not too little to be junk, but not too big for him to handle.  We have really enjoyed this drum by playing with our little big boy.  To note, when we play it, it's easiest to be played with our fingertips, and sounds really good. Highly recommend it for both adults who want a little djembe, or for babies or toddlers... we feel it's enjoyable for any age.
