I love these little fans.  Plug right into the USB port on the front of my computer and the cord is about 3 feet long so I can move it around wherever I need it.  These things move a surprising amount of air for as super-quiet as they are.  I'm on the phone all day and it's nice to not have any fan noise while I'm talking to customers.  I bought 2 for people at work and turned around and bought 2 more for the house.  My co-worker put USB ports on his fishing boat (yes, he really did) and uses his for the dog days of Summer fishing here in Houston.  They're great!
