When I was a teenager I always dreamed of owning a les paul but  I was not able to afford one. Even until recently it was only eye candy for a window shopper. So after some saving here I am a les paul richer. This thing is a beaut.. The only thing that threw me off was the g force tuning thing all in all it plays like silk spun from jews gold! F-ing nice. Will update later after some learnins of the new features.
