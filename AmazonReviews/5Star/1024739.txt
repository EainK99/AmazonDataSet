This is an exceptional drum to say the least. I was looking at other high end snares including the black Beauty and dunnett's. However I just couldn't justify paying the extra $500-800 for almost the same stainless steel snare. When it was delivered, I was surprised by how light it was. After getting it tuned up, it has such a great and deep crack to it. It feels incredible. The tube lugs and steel finish make it an absolute beauty. Best purchase I've made, especially considering it was under $300. Would definitely recommend it.
