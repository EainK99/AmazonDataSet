I didn't buy this for myself, so I can't offer a through review of the product. I bought it for my musical brother, and although everybody looked at me like I was crazy for buying such a senseless gift, he immediately started digging through his wallet to find something to punch out. To both of our surprise, the pick he got from an old gift card was pretty amazing. He loved the gift and started rambling on about all the ways it would save him on a day where he goes through a few too many picks. Great random gift!
