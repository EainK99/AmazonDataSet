I read reviews saying the 18 volts was unfiltered, however this must be fixed with this version.<br />I am running a bunch of pedals at 9 volts, but my Xotic EP Booster which is supposed to be sensitive at 18 was quiet as could be.<br />Some reviews said it was nothing more than a splitter, this is not true because as it powers up you can see the outputs light up one at a time. Doing some kinda load check I am guessing. After more reading they are not \\"True Isolated\\" but I have not had a problem with this at all. I power a TS9, TS808, MXR Carbon Copy, Dunlop Cantrell Wah, Boss TU2, Xotic EP (18v), Malekko 616 Delay, Malekko Phaser, Mooer Ninety Phaser. 9 pedals off of it! No probs no noise.<br />It comes with an adapter to power the unit.<br />There are (8) 9 volt outputs and (2) 18 volt outputs.<br />It comes with power cords to hook up your pedals. These haves straight and a 90 degree end.<br />It takes up the space of a typical pedal, but you'll need a little extra room around it for the plugs, but overall it takes very little room.
