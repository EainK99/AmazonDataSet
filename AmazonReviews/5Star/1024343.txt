Simply put, I was thrilled with this stand when I pulled it out of the box.  It is STRONG, well-built, easy to use.  I can't imagine that there is a better TV stand product on the market, frankly, even for a lot more money.  It is EXTREMELY robust and well built.  Don't look any further than this tripod for a TV stand.
