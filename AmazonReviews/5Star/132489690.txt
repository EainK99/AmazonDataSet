I've always been an old school guy when it came to strings. When coating came out I stuck to my D'Addario guns. On lower end guitars, it really doesn't matter. But after switching OFF of these Elixirs on my Taylor 816, I could hear and feel the difference. These are tight, bright, and keep the playability for weeks and weeks. It's going to have to be these for me from now on.
