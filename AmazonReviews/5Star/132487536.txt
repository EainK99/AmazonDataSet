I bought it to replace the chrome one I had previously lost, and I was impressed with the tone. The tone is much more mellow and mild than chromed steel, but not quite as much as glass. I'm can't have a glass slide because they all seem to break. This is great for acoustics and your best option for electric. Definitely great for that classic blues tone.
