Bought three of these and loved them, so I reordered more.  Secures and protects my instruments well.  I used them to get my guitars out of the floor stands I was using, and to make them easily accessible while still keeping them safe.  3 electrics, 2 acoustics, and an electric bass are now on the wall where I can enjoy looking at them and can quickly grab one to enjoy playing it.  Hanger is very well made and I have no fear that it could fail.
