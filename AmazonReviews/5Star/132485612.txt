These Hitlights LEDs are amazing. I own the blue ones and put them in the footwells of my 2012 Ford Fiesta. Ordering these is a lot less expensive than having OEM LEDs installed through a car dealer. As for installation, these are already 12V, so all I had to do was wire them into the car's electrical system to get them to light. I went to Lowes and bought plastic, clear tubing to put these LEDs in for protection and they look amazing. I had previously bought some blue LEDs from Wal-Mart, and these Hitlights are MUCH brighter and totally drown those out. I have moved the crappy Wal-Mart ones to the trunk. Out of all those LEDs, only one did not work, which I am not concerned with because it would not be worth it to return for just that one that burned out. Overall, I am very satisfied and would definitely buy again if I ever owned another car.
