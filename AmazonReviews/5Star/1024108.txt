This is so easy to use. If spent a lot of money on your “baby” I mean your guitar then you had better have a humidifier. I know there are ways to do it yourself but it is such a pain in the but. I mean just buy this simple tool and take all the work out of it. All you need to do is take the sponge out, wet it, and put it back together. Then slide the device between the guitar string where it securely stays. I love the no drip no mess design its so convenient. And you don’t have to worry about the sponge ever getting moldy or disgusting because it is antimicrobial. I mean this just makes keeping your guitar in good shape so much easy. What a humidifier does is keeps your wood from warping and cracking as your guitar ages. A humidifier will keep your guitar looking great and in prime condition. I haven’t had it long enough to notice a difference but the theory is proven. I recommend this to anyone who owns a guitar made from wood. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
