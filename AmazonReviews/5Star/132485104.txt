[[VIDEOID:mo2PWZRSCRPS0S0]]The Alesis USB Podcast mike is the perfect and quick setup for recording Podcast. You will need a foam wind cover or a pop filter, because if there's one weakness this mike has, it's that it pops too much if you talk too close.<br /><br />I have only the microphone and stand without the headphones and software that comes with this package, so I can't comment on those.<br /><br />Setting up the mike is easy. Simply plug it in to the USB port on your computer. I use Wavepad sound editor. Windows 7 found the mike immediately with no set up at all. In Wavepad, all I had to do was select the Alesis mike from the pulldown input menu (it had the line-in port set as default). Then I simply set my volume level at minus 12 dB to eliminate the room's background noise.<br /><br />The Alesis provides a very warm vocal tome optimized for computer speakers. The extreme bottom end is clipped just enough to eliminate low frequency ambient sounds. You can equalize your audio clips to suit your own voice, but for most people, this will not be necessary. The extreme high end rolls off just enough to eliminate the brashness that occurs with other mikes. The mike is designed for close use, as it's noise cancelling ability reduces sound from far away. This is a big plus for any mike used for pod casting and announcing. The air conditioner vent noise and computer fan which can be heard in the room do not get picked up by this mike.<br /><br />The little microphone stand is an added bonus, and it is rubber shock mounted to reduce table noise.<br /><br />The end result is a very rich, resonant, natural sounding vocal tone with very little or almost no background noise. Add just a touch of EQ and a little music and you can have a podcast that sounds like it was made in a recording studio. Listen to my recording to hear what it sounds like.
