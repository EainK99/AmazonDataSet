Dean Markley Blue Steel are the only strings I ever use anymore on my bass & on my 10 guitars! I worked as a tool & cutter grinder for 35 years in an aerospace machine shop. They first came out with cryotec processed tool steel for making tooling. It's amazing what the process does to steel! These strings stay bright and new sounding for so long I almost feel bad changing them.
