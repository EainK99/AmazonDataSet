I had low cost $6.7 Panasonic120K and this earphone. IE4 has mind blowing low and high music quality for the paid money and same time Panasonic120K delivered more than paid money. so what you pay and what you got, I am happy with IE4..But personally felt for $52, they should provide proper packaging and case to hold the earphone. Otherwise they need to reduce $10 from current price..:-)
