I was about to give up on shopping for slides as all of them dunlop, fender, etc seemed to be just a cut off piece of pipe.<br />Slides are supposed to come down to the second joint of the finger not cover the whole finger.<br />Even worse were the glass ones because they were keep moving around your finger, I'd constantly be worried to drop them.<br />That said, this is the only slide you will ever need.<br />It looks like a rusty antique that's been passed down generations - simply beautiful.<br />I'm not sure if this is for real or just a placebo effect, but the tarnish makes it sound very warm.<br />Best of all, it fits perfectly in my ring finger and almost perfect in my pinky. When you wear it, it feels like a part of your finger taking away that shakiness that other fat pipes give.<br />It also has enough weight to give you that balance on the strings, but not too heavy to tire your fingers.<br />This is a masterpiece and despite the price, I'm glad it's in my possession - so much that I want another one in case I lose it.
