This is an absolutely great little mic stand, with as classic and simple of a design as possible. Simple is always more likely to get the job done correctly than it's opposite. This thing has a good amount of heft to it, perfect for just about any microphone with a SMALL shock mount.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who have purchased this, only to realize that the bottom isn't heavy enough for their purposes. I am currently using it for a Blue Baby Bottle, with it's stock shock mount, and it is at a comfortable balance. If you were to add a little bit more weight, then it would be likely to fall over easily. You can use this fact to do the math as to whether it would be good for you, or not.<br /><br />The following is not a con. It's just something to look out for- It comes with a sticker on the pole, and I didn't find it to look very good. Mine wasn't easy to remove, either. I had to use some goo gone to take it off.
