This guitar is well made and beautiful. This is a large body guitar so it can handle 12 strings unlike some companies that try to fit 12 strings on a small body guitar designed for 6 strings and you end up with huge deflection or literally ripping the bridge of the guitar. You don't have to worry with this guitar it has the long head and bridge support beam.
