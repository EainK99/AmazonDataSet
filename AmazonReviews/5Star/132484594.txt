This record player plays vinyl records very clearly. It has a portable speaker and an auxiliary output, so you can play music on the go or plug it into speakers to play. However, the built in speaker is acceptable for its size but i would recommend plugging in speakers if you have any lying around you can use. You wont need any sort of receiver in order to play it through auxiliary speakers, although i am not so sure about RCA. NOTE: Don't forget yo turn the power on via the switch on its right hand side where the various outputs are located in order to have a good sound output!! It has a tone and pitch adjustment, along with volume output, so you can always mess around with those if you so choose. There is a USB output for recording onto a computer which is a nice feature if you wish to take any of your vinyls to go with you without having to buy a digital version. I am very happy with this purchase and i would highly recommend it for anyone.
