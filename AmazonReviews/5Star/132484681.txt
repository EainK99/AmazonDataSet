If you are an avid acoustic guitar player that does anything further up the neck than the third fret. You will want these strings.  I have used these on all of my accoustic guitars for years.  I won't use anything else.  Last year I got a new accoustic guitar and the first thing I did was change D'Addario Flat Tops.  They enable you to do slides and other string work with a minimum of the squeak and dragging noise that normal flat wound strings will all give you.  So, remove that will keep your playing from sounding great.  They have a mellower tone than wound round, but I find that preferable, besides the \\"brightness\\" that people talk about really goes away on the other strings pretty quickly as the strings age.  Another thing, these strings are VERY durable.  I have found that some of the popular round wounds have a tendancy to break more quickly than these do.<br />Stop the squeaking!<br />Buy these strings
