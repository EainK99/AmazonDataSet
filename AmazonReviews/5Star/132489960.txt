This book is written from the point of view of teens attending a summer camp for children who stutter. They address many issues related to stuttering, which is what makes this book so wonderful. The chapters are short and include several brief homework activities. An SLP can purchase the book, which includes notes for the clinician, and give the CD to the child to read at home. It is written by well respected experts in the field of speech therapy for stuttering. I highly recommend this book.
