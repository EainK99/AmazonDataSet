I recommend this tuner for anyone who plays acoustic guitar. Its WAY easier to tune up using the Snark! Just clip it onto the guitar head, instead of having to unplug from sound equipment, and plug into a pedal or handheld tuner. I love that it accurately tunes off of vibrations, instead of picking up every other sound in the room. LOVE IT!
