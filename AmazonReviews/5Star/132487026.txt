I got this stand expressly to hold a thin-screen TV to use as my video monitor onstage. I'm certain it'll be just exactly what I'm looking for. I'll be having to do a bit of modification, but, alas, I do that with about everything. ('Changing it to be used as a monitor stand - which is way more expensive than this puppy. Yup. Call me cheap.)<br /><br />'Want I substantial stand (even for putting sheet music on)? Get it...
