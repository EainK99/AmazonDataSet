Bought this wireless microphone and receiver for our Rotary Club.  We have an annual fund-raiser Hounds on the Hill which is held in a large park area.  It was easy to plug into a sound mixer which had two large speakers pointed at the general area.  the sound was clear and clean. But the two features which were far better than expected were:  1.) The description says it has a 250 foot range... I went well over 300 feet away from the receiver and it never fell-off.  2.) Next was the battery life.  As a professional speaker I've used wireless mics that used 9V batteries and they would have to be changed by noon after only 3 1/2 - 4 hours of use.  This one takes two AA batteries and it didn't lose one bar of power after 5 hours of use. Can't beat it for the price.
