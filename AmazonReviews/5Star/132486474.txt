I've been using these as under cabinet lighting in our kitchen for the past 3 years.  I have 4 of these lights and they are powered up 24 hours a day/365 days of the year.<br /><br />They are a little too white or too cool.  I might add a little yellow film to warm up the color a bit.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the price .
