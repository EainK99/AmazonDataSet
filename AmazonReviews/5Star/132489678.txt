I'm using it on my ukulele and didn't want a gigantic, heavy tuner so this fits the bill perfectly!  It looks big and clunky in the pictures but it's actually cute and dainty (for a tuner).  And in addition, it works great for my husband's bass as it has changeable settings (chromatic, guitar, bass, violin, or ukulele).  The display is easy to read and changes color when the string is in tune. Great deal at the sale price, don't hesitate, just buy it!!
