I really love these pickups. Be forewarned if you are a codger like me though - the installation is tiny and close work even though its supposed to be solderless. I had no luck at first getting the leads into the contact holes as the wires are so thin and bend back so easily.  However -- once I tinned the leads with a bit of solder to stiffen them up they went in smooth as silk. So, tin the leads, insert into contact holes, tighten with supplied screwdriver and you are done! Adjust the height of each to taste and enjoy!
