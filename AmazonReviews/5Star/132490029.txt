The mallets arrived ahead of schedule and as soon as they arrived I opened them up for play.<br /><br />I'm used to yarn mallets, and the material on these heads is a bit different, sounds great on synthetic bars: much more resonant and deep while still perfect for accents, rolls, etc.<br /><br />The handles are also really great, perfect length and everything.<br /><br />I plan on using these mallets for a long time.
