This is an excellent product if it is what you are looking for. Here are two questions to help you decide<br /><br />do you want a sax, want to learn the sax but can't afford it, play the sax and want something similar to noodle on? If the answer is yes to any of those this is not the instrument you are looking for.<br /><br />if you want to learn the xaphoon, want something novel, or play the sax and what to experiment with something new? this is what you want.
