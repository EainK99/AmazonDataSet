First of all, I've come to use only Dava Jazz picks. I also have the delrin (red) and the gels (orange). To be honest, I thought I would get the nylons (yellowish green) simply because of the color... however, they have a great feel to them. They are not as stiff as the gels or the delrin and it makes it a little easier to strum. Lead work is still a breaze (these picks are the best for lead work and not dropping from your hand). It you're like me and have shaky hands anyways, you need something that is solid and not slick to hold onto. The rubber \\"glove\\" around the pick is perfect for this and it never gets in the way of my playing. I've been playing guitar for about 24yrs, some professional, mostly as a hobby, and these are the best picks I have ever used. I will definitely be sticking with Dava Jazz Nylons!!!
