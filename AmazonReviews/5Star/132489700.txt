I already use the HRT Music Streamer II + as the sole DAC and input device on a hifi system in another room.  I was looking to improve the audio in my living room HTPC setup, so I looked to the less expensive HRT Streamer II and I'm very pleased.<br /><br />Setup is stupid simple.  It is a good idea, if this will be your main audio output, to go into the sound settings in windows and disable any other sound output devices.<br /><br />I was just using the Motherboard audio output with a mini plug to RCA adapter into the back of my inexpensive Onkyo stereo.  The sound was pretty bad with noticeable noise in the line.  I plugged in the Music Streamer II and the difference is incredible.  I was able to audition my old setup with the Streamer II on different inputs of the Stereo Amp while playing the same music through each input simultaneously.  This allowed me to switch between the two inputs and the difference is very pleasant and immediately noticeable.  The noise floor is dramatically lower.  There is much better detail and space in the music, with more detail in the whole dynamic range.  It can play my 96khz/24bit files downloaded from HD Tracks!  This is all running through a pretty inexpensive setup of a budget Onkyo amp and some Boston Acoustic bookshelf speakers!  I think this (relatively) inexpensive USB DAC cost more than my amp!  But I think it is definitely a worthwhile upgrade; I would argue it is an upgrade that you should do before you buy a new amp or speakers since you want a good clean source.<br /><br />I haven't auditioned this against my HRT II+ on my hifi setup in my office.  If I get around to doing that I can update this review.
