Been looking for the right overdrive pedal for years and I finally found it. Love the fact that there's a bass knob, which lets you keep the deep bass sounds and add distortion on top of it. I'm not a versatile player. I play progressive post rock. Was looking to get a tone that replicated an old tube amp with rough distorted gain, while keeping the low frequencies present. This pedal exceeds that and is now my favorite.
