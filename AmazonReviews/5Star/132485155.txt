I bought this because I wanted a solid, heavy duty mount for my Alesis Control Pad. I use a rack system for my drums and this fit perfectly.<br /><br />One thing to watch out for is neither the Alesis Control Pad nor the Roland APC-33 come with screws. You will need standard rack screws in order mounty it to an Alesis Control Pad
