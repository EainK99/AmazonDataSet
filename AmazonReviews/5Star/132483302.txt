I have a lot of china and porcelain, but none of it is as beautiful or functional as this!<br />I saw this ocarina 7 months ago and ive been saving for it ever since. I finally got the money and I purchased it. It came 2 weeks before it was supposed to, and the packaging kept the instrument so safe that its astonishing.<br />It comes in a nice box. upon opening the box you see what is visible in the photos here on Amazon.<br />In the box is more bubble wrap, and a piece of paper which shows the scales (one with flats and sharps, another without) for both the C scales and the F scale in tab form. It is in another language, but the crafter went in and hand translated/highlighted most of what was written on the paper.<br />The ocarina itself is beautifully hand crafted in porcelain. It has a bit of weight to it, but it can be expected. The painting is amazing, and it is thickly glazed over to protect the art. The ocarina literally shines with the metallic gold paint and glossy glaze. there is a hole going across the mouthpiece towards the base of it for a string, but I have no use for it, but the great thing about that is the holes don't hinder the design or the look of the ocarina. They are there and large enough for a string or strap, but they don't get in the way or look like something that was tacked on at the end.<br />it is about the same size as the Focalink 12 hole plastic in Alto C, but the shape of it more matches the curves of my hand.<br />The sound is the most amazing thing about it. It can hit all of the notes no problem with very little breath pressure, which is fantastic for longer songs. There is absolutely no, yes, NO AIRINESS in the smallest bit! The ocarinas sound seems to echo around the room, even in rooms which don't echo. It isn't too loud, but it certainly isn't a soft-tones instrument! Every song I play on it sounds amazing. I would definitely order from this seller again, or even go out of my way to purchase this same instrument in other octaves/chamber amounts.<br />I highly recommend this instrument and the seller. Absolutely fantastic!
