I saw this item on sale on amazon, and I was looking for a nice keyboard thats not to cheap, but not to expensive. I studied the keyboard and found all the reviews on the item to be excellent. I was not disappointed when I recieved the piano either. The piano looks absulutely stunning in white,soundslike your playing a real baby grand piano. There is not alot of bells and whistles on this thing, but it sure has a heck of a good sound that makes up for it. there are I think 10 piano sounds in all, a few organ sounds but I tend to leave those alone as the music I play doesn't sound good with the organ unless your playing a blues or bossa nova type song. I like the simple design of the keyboard as it only has 3 buttons to push in all. What I like most about the keyboard is that it has all 88 keys so it feels more authentic to play on.
