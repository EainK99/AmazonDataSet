At the age of 55 I decided its time I learned how to play the guitar. I remembered taking lessons at school and hardly learned anything.<br />Once i'd bought the guitar I looked on youtube for lessons and found videos of Rock Prodigy, I decided to buy the app for my Ipad and give it a try. It was the best move I ever made. After only a few months I can now play some tunes confidently. The program doesn't just give you songs to learn, it actually teaches you how to play the guitar properly. If you have difficulty with a section you can easily slow down the tempo and then increase it gradually as you get the hang of it. It also has a great tuner to make sure your guitar is always tuned correctly. Each section is scored so its easy to see if you are improving.<br />The customer support is first class and you usually get a reply straight away.<br />If you're looking for guitar lessons buy this now, you definitely won't regret it.
