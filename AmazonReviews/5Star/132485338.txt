I've used a couple of other brands of this technology.  One of the others ate batteries even when the unit was off.  One was hard to position to see the read-out.  THIS one works GREAT!  Good battery life, good flexibility for positioning the screen to read it, bright, easy-to-see.  I will buy this again.
