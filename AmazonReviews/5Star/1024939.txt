This is a great record player for the price and exceeds my old one from years ago. It had trouble with one of my oldest, most well worn albums but my other albums played fine with just a little popping. This is nice because it has a built in pre-amp so it works with my new receiver. Just be sure to follow the directions when putting together. Just a note, the motor spindle you put the belt around is brass colored, not the one that is silver.
