The lacquer finish has some very minor flaws, nothing obnoxious. But it seems to be applied reasonably thin.<br /><br />The rosette is simple, but attractive and a bit unusual.<br /><br />After playing it for a few months, it is settling in reasonably well. The action is a bit high for a flamenco, though not more than other factory guitars, but it may become possible to adjust it downward some after a year or so when the wood falls into its more or less permanent form. I'm not observing much in the way of buzzing.<br /><br />A great value at the $500 price point. I won mine on a raffle. $10 ticket.
