Beautifully made and comfortable to wear. My only complaint is that the leather thong used to adjust the length is too thick to go through the holes. I replaced it with two Chicago screws and that's been the best decision. I've adjusted the length at least six times until I found the best place for me. Banjos are heavy! The sheepskin lining feels so nice! I'm using Levi Leather straps on both guitars and my uke as well and I adore them. No longer do I think about the strap, I just wear them comfortably for hours at a time and enjoy their beauty. Highly recommended.
