The answer to any and qll questions. I have not had a ton of experience with pedal boards...but i have had the Pedal Train 2(non-powered) and the Boss BCB60(powered) and I by far love the Professional SKB Series. With eight independently powered 9v outlets plus an additional 3 120v outlets that are capable of running other electrical equipment (amps, wall warts, pianos, lights...ect) without the slight hint of interference is amazing. I have not wired the effets loops YET but from professional advise they are the best. It spacious, beautiful and looks like a beast when on/off stage.<br /><br />The down side: Its a bit big and bulky, and when loaded with all my pedals a little heavy. The internal power cord is non-removable (An electrician can do some spot work for about $30-$50 to correct that issue) and it is unable to lock(im told that meets ATA guidlines as you can not fly with locked equipment...or so im told by Lufthansa Airlines). The clips that close the lid are not centered to the clasp and bothers me a but.<br /><br />Answers: If you want a powered PROFESSIONAL pedal board its bound to be big and bulky to meet the requirements of a live player as set forth by years of trial and error. You are told to unlock and unstrap any equipment that you fly with by some airlines (mostly international in my time) and a locking mechanism would be laborious especially if a key is lost. I dont think there is an answer for the clasps though...<br /><br />All in all its an amazing product that gives each pedal its own power source, professional, protective and kind of expensive (however a Pedal Power brick at $169 and a Pedal Train Pro at 299.95) its worth it...<br /><br />Keep makin em SKB...ill keep buyin em
