I originally purchased the non-waterproof version of these strip lights for under counter lighting in my kitchen.  I was so impressed by the lights that I decided to do under cabinet lights in my motor home as well to replace the overhead incandescent .  The waterproof versions are better for a location where they can be seen.  Since the motor home is 12V there is no need for a converter.<br /><br />If you are anywhere near competent with a soldering iron it is very easy to solder leads to the strips and then protect the union with shrink tape.  This makes for a very easy connection to the existing light switches in the rig.<br /><br />The lights have worked perfectly since installation and I hope to have many years of trouble free use from them.<br /><br />The lights and order arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
