This bass is a great instrument for the price i paid. Its an excellent practice or starter bass. It needed some adjustments when i first took it out of the box,but that's to be expected for any shipped instrument. They didn't have the color i ordered but let me know quickly and shipped the green one the next day. It said it came with an extra set of strings but only one was in the box. Overall it has played very well and Im happy with my purchase.
