it's a pretty cool little guitar. Just like a full size one but baby sized. My son just broke his a little bit at the seem where the neck meets the body and we were able to fix it with gorilla glue. It's pretty sturdy though and has taken a beating will we are trying to teach him to respect the instrument and how to treat it.
