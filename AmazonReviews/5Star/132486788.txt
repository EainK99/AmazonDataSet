I modded my Roland Micro Cube with this larger speaker to try to get rid of the flabbyness at high gains the Micro cube is known for. It makes the amp sound fuller and has more midrange.<br />It is a great speaker.<br />In my case unfortunately the Micro Cube must have flabbyness built into its circuitry.. I tried playing the amp with the speaker hooked up laying on the workbench, before I installed it into the cabinet (Which I had to &#34;modify&#34; to accept the the speaker), thinking the small cabinet contributes to the speaker flabbing and it still Flabbed at MAX volumes on certain AMP settings. Not as much but it still happened. But at less then cranked volumes, it sounds really good.  I also did an &#34;A&#34; &#34;B&#34; test with the 5&#34; original Micro Cube speaker just to get the idea of the difference. It was significant.<br /><br />I tried this hooked up to Old Fender VibroChamp to test the speakers capabilities to assure me that the speaker wasnt flabbing out. The VC has its original Fender Special Design 8&#34; in it<br />In that application it was HUGE... It sounded really good. No Flab.<br />Great Speaker great Price.
