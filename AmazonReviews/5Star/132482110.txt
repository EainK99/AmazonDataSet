I just got my NC65. Only used it once, but Hoooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!! Can you say \\"performance\\"?!? Its all s-t-a-b-i-l-t-y.<br /><br />Yeah, sure $30 can seem like its overpriced. \\"Its just a stand\\"...<br />Can you hear the difference between a $10 10' guitar center cable and a $25 10\\" George L's cable.... you really gonna complain about having indefinite stability while working on your $1k+ guitar/s?<br />Really? hahahaha<br /><br />I have had a Planet Waves Tripod for 7-8yrs. For 7-8yrs I have hated that I spent all of $8 on it. Worst $8 ever spent. There is no stability whatsoever in that thing... doing a string change on that is a few choice hairs better than using a rolled up towel or t-shirt.<br /><br />The NC65 is a much better tool for the job. You can bump the table, and your guitar wont fall over off the stand. You can flip the guitar on its face to work on the backside and have no support issues. Just the convenience and piece of mind this tool provides makes it worth the small dent of $30. I change strings weekly on 3 guitars... 3 times a week 52 weeks a year means 156 string changes where I'm not gonna have to worry about the Mastiff bumping the table and knocking over the ASAT. That's 956 times I'm gonna be working the winders to loosen the strings and not worry about keeping the guitar \\"balanced\\" and keep it from tipping over. And thats another 956 more times Im gonna be working the winders to tighten those strings without worry of the guitar falling off the tripod. This thing pays for itself. Spend your money wisely.
