[[VIDEOID:7834b1b79311b1e205929ca42662e5d8]]So I got this tuner as a sample to review and evaluate. First off, it's really really simple. You click it on to tune and it mutes so you don't bother your listeners and you click off to get the \\"in tune\\" fire works started.  Made of durable metal too, so don't go throwing it around children or anything like that.
