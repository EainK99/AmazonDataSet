FIRST OF ALL IF U NOT PLANING ON BUYING AN AMP DONT BUY THIS  250ohms  this thing cannot be power by laptop nor ur iphone it doesnt give enough juice, i use a E11 and can barely power it so buy an amp if u buy the 250ohm version.<br /><br />build quality 9/10  nice quality metal on the band and a removeable leather cover i give it a 9 because of the plastic on the ear piece but its a good quality plastic hard like metal but i give it a 9 because its not metal. really nice cord very long and gold plated. its made in germany so german quality are nice<br /><br />look8/10  ok these are not meant to be use outside. these are meant to use inside ur room or a studio where no extra sound but music they dont look very stylish but headphone are more about sound not style. they look like something from 1990-2000 years  but still very nice<br /><br />sound10/10  amazing sound hear everything.. these are open back so people can hear ur music if u play it loud  and u can hear other.. when i had them on for first time .. it felt like i never had them because  i could hear other perfectly  these sound amazing  nice tight bass  clear highs and mids... very nice.. but it does lack on a vocal when people are singing but nothing too big .. sound amazing<br /><br />overall10/10  nice cant beat the price  amazing
