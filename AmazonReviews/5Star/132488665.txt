I love these - and my wife makes fun of me whenever she sees them on my head. The sound is fantastic - great highs and lows. I bought this because I ride the subway and I was looking for something that would muffle the sound. These work very well - to the point that I can listen to music or books without having to turn the volume up too high.They are very snug on the head, but the padding is soft and they feel comfortable. Compared to the much more expensive headphones available (Bose, Beats, etc...) save yourself $150 or more and get these - they sound just as good or better (to me at least). I have recommended these to many people. And yes, even though my wife makes fun of me she enjoys listening to music with these on.<br /><br />I have had these over a year or more being put into my bag and pulled out multiple times a day and they still look great - great quality. I'll be purchasing these again if my first pair ever wears out.
