I am a baby boomer getting ready to retire in a few months. Like many boomers, I am excited to start doing some of the things I didn't have time for while working. Through the years I have enjoyed strumming my guitar and singing old Appalachian ballads, country and folk tunes. I had never used a mic or amplifier, but thought it might make practicing more fun, and that it has. It works very well in my living room where I play for myself and family, but I believe would work well for an open mic performance or something of that nature. I'm not an expert, but for me this works very well. I'm having some fun and if I do say so myself, I'm actually getting better. Along with the Loudbox Mimi, I also purchased a Shure SM58-LC microphone and got a great deal for both from Amazon. I'm very happy with my purchase.
