This is the one. All lower models like the G30 have bad battery doors which can pop open and are made of plastic.This one has metal construction and a slide out battery case which is impossible to pop open.<br /><br />There is no comparison to lesser units in this range. The G75 is what you are looking for. If you need to broadcast to a mix room behind a crowd, say in a large church, you might want the next model up; but in any other case, this is the one. If you're within 30 feet of your amp this is all you need.
