Losing the use of my right hand to a hemorrhagic stroke, and the left hand to surgery, knew I would have to face facts and become proficient in a \\"Speech Recognition\\" program.<br /><br />While I am still learning, I am making progress using the Audio Technica ATR 2500.  I use it in conjunction with a very high end pair of Sennheiser headphones (just a preference, as any quality headphones may be just as good).<br /><br />For less than $60.00 delivered, I cannot be more pleased with the purchase.  \\"Value\\" does not equal \\"Cheap\\", and this is a very solid microphone.  You will not be disappointed.  Like everyone else, I researched many microphones from $10.00 to $250.00, and do not believe there is a better option than the ATR 2500.<br /><br />You work too hard for your money to throw it away on products, or services, that do not deliver. I am obsessive about the little money I have, so please believe I worked hard to maximize the purchase.<br /><br />The package arrived exactly as promised, and I am amazed by today's advanced shipping methods.<br /><br />Every review I read said the microphone stand was flimsy, and the microphone would easily tip, or fall.  They are correct, but it does get you started until you can spend $15.00 for a solid desk stand.  I am not trying to look like a radio DJ with swing arms, exotic suspension mounts, etc.  I am simply speaking into it, and my computer understands what I am saying.<br /><br />I do wish it had an on/off switch, but simply unplugging the usb cable isn't a very laborious chore when you think of it.<br /><br />Think about placing a soft mat under the desk stand, and as I move along will contemplate a pop filter, or some type of screen.<br /><br />Super easy hook up, no software to download, and I'm leaving it on all day as my speech recognition learns my voice pattern.<br /><br />I will point out a very important feature of \\"zero latency\\" when listening through headphones.  There is no \\"delay\\" between when you speak, andwhen you \\"hear\\", so it's less confusing in your head.<br /><br />SOLID metal construction, great looking (if you care about such things), and after reviewing literally all usb microphones on the market, felt this would suit my needs. Something I could \\"grow\\" into as I learn voice recognition, and voice recording for podcast.<br /><br />It has an \\"ethereal\\" blue glow from the led, and in my opinion, does not distract the user.<br /><br />My first purchase on Amazon, and was overjoyed with the process.<br /><br />Enjoy this microphone, and just have fun with it.  You WILL NOT find a better solution to your straightforward microphone needs.  Not a musician, cannot comment, but have no reason to believe it will not perform flawlessly.<br /><br />Ron<br /><br />Tampa, Florida
