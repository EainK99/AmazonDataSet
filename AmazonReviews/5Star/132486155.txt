I bought my original A56D's for using them for their intended purpose but I had to buy some more because I quickly realized they could be used for other purposes.  I bought two of these for mounting shot-gun microphones to basketball goal mounts.  If you purchase ratchet clamps for woodwork you can attach this microphone mount to the steel ratchet bar.  Works great!
