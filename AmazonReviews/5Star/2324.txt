I have a 3-piece blues rock band that plays clubs, outdoor events and the like to crowds of up to 350. Before buying the SW118V woofer, we played these gigs with a Yamaha EMX512SC powered mixer plus 2 Yamaha 15 cabs on sticks. Adding the SW118V has improved our sound immeasurably. We run mono with the mains driving the 2 15s and the monitor send driving the SW118. We mic everything now (which we couldn't do before), including guitar, kick/snare and bass. Kick and bass go primarily in the monitor send to the 118; guitar and vocals into the main send to the 2 15s. It smooths out the sound remarkably, making even outdoor gigs sound like a bona fide full-production mix. The difference really is remarkable. I can't give this speaker -- especially in a configuration like ours -- high enough praise.
