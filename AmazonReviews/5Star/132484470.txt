The EUROLIVE B205D rocks. It is probably as good as it's Mackie counterpart, the SRM150. This small speaker will surprise you at the loudness and quality of sound it produces. The combination xlr / 1/4&#34; inputs are great as well as the EQ. Very nice as a personal monitor. Great for jamming around the house or stage. The Instrument input basically makes this a small amplifier for an acoustic guitar, and the phantom power allows you to use condenser microphones. Basically, a small personal jam station. I have not had any problems yet, but this is one Behringer product I would stand behind....or in front of!
