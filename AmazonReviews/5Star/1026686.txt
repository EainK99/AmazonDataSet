Great sound, especially the bass. The sound insulation is very impressive, when the speakers are put together, you cannot hear any noise coming out unless you're really blasting the music. The cord is very well designed. It is thick enough that you aren't going to damage anything if you accidentally roll over it in your chair, and the coiled design makes it great for moving around. They are also extremely comfortable, and dont make my ears hurt or hot. I have a large head, and you can jack these out to fit even the largest head, yet they still fit snugly on my small-headed room mate. Fantastic headphones, I recommend them to everyone.
