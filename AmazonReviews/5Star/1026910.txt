Super-solid and super-stable speaker support even before filling the central post with lead shot and concrete mix. Very good looking in a way that doesn't call attention to themselves but also doesn't detract from the speakers, or the rest of the studio/listening room. Great flexibility in providing a choice of sharp carpet-piercing spikes or hard rubber feet by retaining or removing the hard rubber covering over the spikes. Rubber bumpers on the top plate hold speakers securely without marring their finish and provide some decoupling from the stand. And to top off this well thought-out design, even with the large chamber filled with damping/ballast material, there are two channels available for running speaker cable and for amplified monitor speakers, the power lead separately.<br /><br />You could spend hundreds more for &#34;audiophile&#34; speaker stands that are no more solid and certainly less well designed than these.<br /><br />The Nerds service and fast shipping and great price made this an excellent purchase.
