Producing a podcast we first started with Alesis Multimix 4 because of the ease of use with USB output.  However, it became evident quite quickly that this ease of use came at a cost with a low quality amp inside, which produced a lot of noise in recording.<br /><br />Switching to this amp, while a tad more work, produces much much better sound.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a great entry level, clean sounding amp.
