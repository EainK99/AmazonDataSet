After using the DW 5000 double for a number of years I became very curious as to how they could make their double better.<br />A few weeks ago I sat down in my favorite drum shop and really played one and was in heaven!<br /><br />I found this pedal to be smoother, quieter, faster than my previous 5000. When you put your mind to it, you can perform things you may have thought impossible before.<br /><br />It took me awhile to spend the money for this pedal but I am sure glad I did. It is worth it to buy a premium pedal such as this is!
