This is a powerful and easy to use microphone! This was actually my first time buying a higher quality microphone, and I saw this one on sale so I thought I would give it a shot. BLOWN AWAY. So easy to install and use and it sounds AMAZING. I also love how you can change up the settings and dynamics for different audio needs. Plus it's convenient how it can screw onto the end of a boom stand. I would definitely recommend to the casual to intermediate audio enthusiast.
