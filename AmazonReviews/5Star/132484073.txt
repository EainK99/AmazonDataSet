This uke was a great buy. Sounds great electrically and acoustically. Great action. Nice wood grain. My Wife has this same uke in its acoustic version only and loves it. I bought her this one for her  to use in her band &#34;Gypsy Sole&#34;.(Facebook it. Live music with this uke coming soon.) She loves it and has not put it down yet.
