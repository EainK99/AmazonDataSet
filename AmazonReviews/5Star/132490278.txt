These microphones are a real bargain for the price. They definitely exceeded my expectations. I notice that Mic A has slightly more gain the Mic B but no big deal and the range is perfect. I used them with my 10 channel powered mixer PA system. I tested them out to 150 feet line of sight and around corners with no problem.
