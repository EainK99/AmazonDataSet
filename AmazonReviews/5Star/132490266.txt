I have this as an added feature to recording musical acts as part of my video/stills business. I performs great atop my camera, or even mounted on the side, depending on the room and its source to record. Easy to see controls and viewing is good until the display turns off, which helps to control the battery drain, but make for poor adjustments, too. Easy to use and figure out, sturdy and reliable. I use this as a directional mic, either at a 90 or 120 degree area to record. I also use the H2n on stage for an ambient sound, and mix all 7 tracks in my audio editor for an outstanding sound on my videos!
