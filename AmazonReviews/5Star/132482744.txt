This microphone was paired with Roland's R-05 portable studio recorder, the resulting recordings where nothing short of true fidelity to the source. This microphone picked up all the nuance, dynamics and timber of the target sounds. The build quality is professional, black anodized aluminum with stainless steel screens over the pick-up elements. The battery access (condenser microphones require an external power source) is neoprene sealed. The result is outstanding performance in a lightweight package.
