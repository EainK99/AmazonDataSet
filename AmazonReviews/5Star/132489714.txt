Good value and nice looking strap that looks pretty much exactly like the photo. If you don't want a strap that has that plastic luggage strap look and also don't care for leather then this inexpensive strap is a good option. I've had it for a few weeks now and it doesn't come loose from my guitar or slip or anything like that. Works perfectly.
