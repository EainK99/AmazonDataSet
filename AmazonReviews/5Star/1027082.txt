I have been playing guitar for 20 years and have experimented with many different strings. Used to break a lot of strings in my college days playing in a band. Back then the coated strings would give you longevity, but sounded like poo. Now, my playing has become more sporadic. Still play on stage every once in while, but mostly at home for my lady and with friends. I have been using these for the last ~2 yrs, and I have to say, I have been impressed with their ability to preserve a decent sound and not rust. I changed them recently after about a good 6 months. If someone has found a better string, Im all ears.
