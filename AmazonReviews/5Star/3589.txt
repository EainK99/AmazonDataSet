This holds my full size cello very securely. I saw someone was worried about the part that supports the back scratching the instrument; it does not. It's like a hardened rubber surface that helps keep the cello secure. No fear of slipping or toppling.<br />-note: I have hard woods floors, though I imagine it would be just as stable on carpet as long as it's not too thick.
