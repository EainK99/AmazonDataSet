As soon as I saw this guitar I fell in love with it. Beautiful colour, matching headstock, binding, onboard tuner and pickup. Then I played it and realised that for the price this was an extremely good value instrument, well made and a joy to play. I use it in live band gigs and it is fantastic. The onboard tuner is not very precise, but I tend to use my pedal tuner anyway. The pickup is responsive and has some eq as well, which is good. Battery replacement is very simple, via the lead jack.
