The RODE invisiLav is an amazing item to have on a small production set, as not only is it cheap and affordable; it gets the job done! What else could you ask for!?<br /><br />I highly recommend to any purchases to order more Clear-sided skin safe &#34;wig&#34; tape, as it doesn't come with nearly enough in the box at purchase.
