This doumbek head lives up to its name.  The doum and tak tones are very clear and true to the resonant sound of the drum itself.  It has the ringyness of a regular Skyndeep polyester head but, because this head is made of mylar, it does not have the sandpapery sound when you move your hand across the surface.  I consider this head to be a top-quality plastic head - easily on par with Power Beat and Mitello, but unique in its own way.<br /><br />If you have a quality doumbek that can produce a clean resonance, I highly recommend this head as it will bring out the purity of the tones.  Give this a shot - if I were the manufacturer, I would guarantee satisfaction.<br /><br />-Thomas
