I had an Ibanez RG with a Floyd Rose or whatever the hell it is called, and personally I spent more time with that guitar tweaking it to get it back to tune, than I do with my Strat with these tuners. I almost never have to tune it and when I do, all I need is a slight turn, one dash away on the tuner screen from the desired note (after a whole day or two of playing). In my opinion, all strats should have these tuners installed. The regular tuners are good too but these are so reliable that for me all strats would be incomplete without one. The most overlooked aspect of a guitar is its tuning reliability or that it can stay in tune. Many people mistakenly buy a guitar because of its looks, but to me, a huge chunk of the motif is the tuning, and with these babies I can say good bye to all guitar brands and stick to my one true love, the strat. All this applies even when I spend a bunch of hours practicing dive bombing and tremolo stuff , there is just nothing like it, I wonder why they took so long in coming up with these things. I feel they are more reliable than the Floyd Rose, minus all the allen key adjusting, unlocking in order to tune, and then locking again. Too much of a hassle, with these you can tune normally once the lock is in place. You never even know it is there and forget about tuning.  Highly recommended, everyone get one so that Fender starts implementing these into their mass production line.
