The Fishman Aura Spectrum DI preamp is a must-have if you play an acoustic/electric guitar. The difference in tone from an under-saddle pickup or sound-hole pickup is simply amazing! You DO actually get a microphone sound and any piezo pickup &#34;quack&#34; or electronic-produced sound can be blended out of your guitar's pickup. I have Takamine acoustic-electric guitars and Guild acoustic-electric guitars and they sound exceptional when plugged into this preamp. Before you purchase this preamp, go to Fishman's website (http://www.fishman.com/products/view/aura-spectrum-di) and review the product information and then download the Aura Gallery III to your computer and scan through all the selections available to you for use with your guitar. Some very high-end microphones were used by Fishman to develop this imaging preamp ($4,000 microphones in some cases). Also, browse Youtube to find out more about this preamp....you won't regret your purchase of this preamp. One additional bit of advise......before you decide to spend money for a new guitar, buy this preamp and &#34;dial in&#34; some images to play through your old guitar. I think you'll find that you won't need a new guitar after having a chance to hear your old guitar plugged into this preamp and run through your PA or amplifier.  If you want your acoustic-electric guitar to sound like it is being recorded in a studio with high-end microphones, this is your preamp!
