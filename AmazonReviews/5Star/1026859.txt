I am satisfied with the microphone. just to clarify I am not a professional but I have been using it to record voices and a guitar player sound in a simple room obtaining a very good quality sound. I am using the macbook air, need to try the use with the Iphone but so far t is easy and very simple to use.<br />It comes with the necessary cables to be used.<br />The other apogee could be enough for me ( non professional use) but I think in the future I will find more uses and this one will be the right one.<br />I read there is no compatibility with windows so I even did not try. But wish they have applications for it.
