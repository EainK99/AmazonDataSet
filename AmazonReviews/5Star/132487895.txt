I recently went back to Analog into my Tube Amp.<br />This I have in my Serial FX Loop.<br />It does very little to color you're tone, but it sounds so sweet.<br />I use 1 setting for everything. 9:00 mix, 1:00 Delay, 10:00 regen, Mod ON.<br />My Cleans are incredible, feels and sounds like I have so much more than just a delay on it.<br />Same setting works great to 80s up my Crunch Tone.<br />Same setting sends my Leads Soaring.<br />I have never been happier with any FX unit in my life.
