I love these pickups in my American Vintage '62 Stratocaster. Simply swap in the new pickguard, solder two leads to the output jack, adjust the pickup heights to taste for best tone and balance. I especially like the second tone control being wired to the bridge pickup, it makes the bridge pickup vastly more useful!
