I was very surprised how well this lit up the walls of our large basement.  I was \\"forced\\" by my wife to buy this item for my daughters birthday dance party.  I was trying to convince her that a 10W light source wasn't going to do much to light up such a large room (25' X 30'), but boy was I wrong.<br /><br />The cord is ridiculously short (2.5 feet?), and that is my only complaint.
