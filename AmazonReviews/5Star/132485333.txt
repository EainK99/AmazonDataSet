With all of the enthusiasm that a new hobby engenders, I started Mandola lessons earlier this year. The loaner instrument was a Gibson, 1911 H-2. My teacher, a life-long musician, first chair mandolinist and Concertmistress Emeritas in the Baltimore Mandolin Orchestra, handed me a Fender 358 Light and a Tortex .88. After a few weeks, she took back the Tortex. Meanwhile, I ordered what I thought were 358 assorted picks but the vendor shipped Extra Heavy picks. I found another vendor and ordered these picks.<br /><br />They are perfect! thick enough to make the strings sing and thin enough to flex for the tremelo. Who would've thought a pick, or plectrum, would make such a difference. I am more excited to practice using this pick than I was with any of the others I've tried.<br /><br />I gave my instructor three of the 358 Heavy picks. The following lesson, she had one of them on her mandolin, the one she was playing with the previous student.<br /><br />I give this pick the highest recommendation and encourage all Mandola players to try them. Like Mikey, you'll like them.
