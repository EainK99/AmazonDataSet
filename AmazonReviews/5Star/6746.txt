This is an awesome product.  After seeing how effective and convenient it has been to use on our drum kit, I've ordered several more to cover our keyboard racks and mixing console.  It's been a joy to keep DUST off of everything.  I like to keep a very, very clean and organized studio and these have helped tremendously in that regard.  Even with everything covered, the entire room still looks very professional.  The weighted corners make easy work of tossing it over whatever one chooses to cover and hold the cover in place.  The covers are obviously very light and the corner weights, while not so heavy as to be a hinderance, securely hold everything as you want it.  Great product and well worth the price.
