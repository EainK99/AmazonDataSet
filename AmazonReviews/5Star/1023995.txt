Love this stuff, I have purchased the red and gold cans and they both work very well to improve &#34;iffy&#34; connections. My only complaint is the sizing, as this can is smaller and contains less product than the cans I have purchased before, but that's my fault for not checking the quantity beforehand. I would also like to see more manufacturers switch to the &#34;smart straw&#34; technology that Wd-40 has, for what you pay for the product I would expect better than a straw taped to the side of the can, (of course it fell off and I lost it immediately).
