I am an amateur electronic music producer and I was looking for some headphones to replace my Sennheiser HD 497s. I am VERY satisfied with these headphones.<br /><br />Construction: Very solid all around. Nothing feels cheap on it. I like that they're collapsible. The coiled cable never gets tangled. The ear pieces rotate 90 degrees to the left and right if needed. They're very comfortable, though there is a weird dull pressure point on the top of my head when wearing these for a long time. My melon is gigantic, which could explain that.<br /><br />Sound: I'm no audiophile. However, with production music, I do have to pay special attention to how different frequency ranges sound. These headphones brought out a lot of details of songs that I never noticed before. I'm so used to headphones where the EQ Vs, so these were a special treat. The bass is very controlled and the mids and highs are not shy to make an appearance. They're not completely noise cancelling, but they reduce outside noises significantly.<br /><br />I've been using these for almost 6 months and it still get a little giddy when I put them on. I've listened to similarly priced Beats headphones and those don't really compare to these.
