This Ion is oh so awesome! It packs quite a punch in the little portable device. The sound is nice quality--though not the best speaker system on the market. Attaches easily to a mobile device with Blue Tooth technology. The lights move to the music selected. It displays  disco ball type lights on the walls and ceiling. There is an option to turn the lights off as well. My little one loves this portable speaker. We have lots of fun listening to music or dancing to the disco lights.
