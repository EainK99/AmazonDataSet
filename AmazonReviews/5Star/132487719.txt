It took me a long time to find a thumb pick that had the right combination of fit and stiffness for me. Ernie Ball picks must be made for children or ladies, because a large pick doesn't fit an adult male thumb, and they are too flimsy for aggressive acoustic picking. Dunlop ivoroid picks come in a large that fits fine, if a little too tight, but the stiffness factor makes them more appropriate for dobro playing.  These Planet Waves thumb picks have the fit and just the right amount of backbone to play acoustic, and they work on electric with medium strings as well.
