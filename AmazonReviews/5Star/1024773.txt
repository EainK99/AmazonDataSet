I use my Moozikpro polishing cloth to keep my Antique Pump Organ dust free and scratch free.  It is a nice size, about 13&#34; square, so one pass covers alot of surface.  I have used microfiber in the past and this double sided velour works faster to remove dust.  I even started polishing a silver plate stand with it.  Its so easy, its almost fun!<br /><br />I like the decorative finish on the edges.  No worries about fraying.  I just wash and hang dry when finished.<br /><br />I recommend for polishing and cleaning your music instruments and even more.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a honest and unbiased opinion.
