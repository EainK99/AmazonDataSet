Great cable at a great price. I love the cloth braiding and flexibility. I have detected no weird noises or crackling in either of the two I purchased. As far as sound quality excluding George Ls I have nothing to compare them to in this price range. They sound much better than the George Ls,easier to care for/store,and they have a nicer appearence. At the price Amazon is asking I believe this is the best deal you'll find on quality guitar cables. Sure you can find cabels a few dollars cheaper but they'll only be half as nice.
