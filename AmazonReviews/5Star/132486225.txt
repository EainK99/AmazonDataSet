I took my used MU-70 back to Guitar Center (the bridge was coming unglued) and they gave me a new one.  At that moment I thought, why not upgrade to a<br />MU-75BK.  And....$29.95 later (plus tax) I had a new MU-75BK!!  What a great looking and playing Uke.  Sounds much richer than the MU-70, and easy to play with the included Aquila strings.  Thanks Guitar Center, and thanks Mitchell.<br />Mike
