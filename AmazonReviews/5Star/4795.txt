I honestly have no clue what these springs really did. I was getting so frustrated with my PRS S2 Standard 24 not staying in tune, despite having replaced the saddles with GraphTech saddles. I was this close to buying an expensive &#34;upgrade&#34; bridge before I figured, eh, let's try some new springs. So I bought and installed these springs. I like them. I went from 3 to 5 springs and still have plenty of ability to float w/ 9s on a 25&#34; scale guitar. Quite nice! Anyway, I don't know if there was some aspect of the setup I was missing before, or if it was all in the springs, but my guitar magically stays in tune now. For just a little bit of cash, I feel like that was well spent, don't you think? Nobody installs these springs and says their guitar got worse afterward. Mine seems better.
