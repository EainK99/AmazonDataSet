Ok, we ordered one and returned it thinking it was broken. It didn't have the threads on the screw hole so we were unable to tighten the lyre on the clarinet. The problem was just that the screw was in the wrong side. Take out the screw and stick it in the opposite direction and it works fine.<br /><br />Next problem is that the lyre isn't straight. If you look at the picture you have the ring that hooks onto your clarinet, then a washer (for lack of a better word) and then the actual lyre. There are 3 main pieces. If you loosen the washer and then retighten the ring you can eventually line up the lyre and ring so it's straight.<br /><br />Sturdy lyre, works great.
