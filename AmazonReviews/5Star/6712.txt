The Neotech strap is a great system for a banjo.  Once you have secured the attachements, you can easily unsnap the body of the strap for storage or cleaning, as well as interchange the strap if you have other models.  For me, the hardest and most time consuming process is attaching a strap to the banjo.<br /><br />The design is easy to use and the strap is very comfortable to wear.  It is also easy to adjust the length.  The stitching is solid and I am confident that this will last for years.
