My 2 1/2 yr old loves it! We got in the mail yesterday and my LO played it for an hour. He asked if he could take it to bed because, \\"I love it so much.\\" I felt bad saying, \\"No.\\"<br />I will be covering the mallet in felt to dampen the sound (since he revels in playing it with as much force as possible). It can be very loud! I was surprised since the mallet is quite light.<br />Fun to play around with. Perfect for first music lessons. It is a major C scale (middle C, D, E, F, A, B, C) and many tunes can be played with it.<br />Pros:<br />1. Great sound<br />2. Letter name and Do-Re-Mi scale impressed on keys (obviously is also color-coded)<br />3. Educational: can be used for music & rhythm (math), cause/effect, colors, hand-eye coordination, sound recognition, role play etc.<br />4. Uses imagination<br />5. Easily transportable<br />6. Fun, very fun<br />7. Inexpensive: $17 for something that plays like a real instrument. Hard to beat that.<br />Cons:<br />1. Loud. Would be nice if it came with a second mallet that would dampen sound. That being said, it is nice that it has a great range of volume and kids love that.
