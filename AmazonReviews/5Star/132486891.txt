This is the best value in a china for a metal or hard rock band.  It has lots of trash and sizzle ad a fairly bright sound.  It really cuts through the mix during a breakdown.  And the price is good.  Chinas usually don't live very lonng cause drummers smack the crap out of them.  This China is pretty durable, and it's cheap enough to replace often if you need to.
