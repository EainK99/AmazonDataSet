I was a bit skeptical of the quality of a brightly lit tuner simply because I have never before seen one. I am experienced with the bland LED style that have been around forever. I am blown away with how bright this display is lit. It almost seems fake in the online images but seriously is that bright! Quick response and spot on tuning. It only takes a second to become familiar with the readings of sharp and flat. I've had it a week and durability will be assessed over time, but it's a tuner, not a tank. I'm sure it will be reasonably solid with normal use. Definitely a great value for the price!
