they never fail me, the versatility they have just really compliment the sound of pretty muck any guitar. Another thing I have found is that the these, more than any of the weights, seem to be less prone to change in sound from package to package. It's funny but after playing for 15 years (which is half my life) I have used pretty much all of the main brands in all their weights on all my guitars and I have settled on these for my &#34;Good for anything you can throw at me&#34; strings. I won't go to a gig without at least one package in my case and usually buy them by the box during the busy seasons but buying these three packs here are a life saver when I need them quickly. It just isn't worth buying strings at the big box music stores anymore.
