I bought this to use on my classic guitar.  I have a amateur recording project underway, and  I wanted to add a track for the guitar.  As another reviewer mentioned, it picks up all noise associated with the instrument just as any microphone would.  This is different from an magnetic coil pickup standard on electric guitars which amplify only the vibrations from the metal strings.  For the price, it is a good tool for my task.
