I purchased this for tailgating at NFL games. It has been a big hit often having folks from all around coming over to make song requests because the volume is great. I have kept my phone on my hip and used the blue tooth feature with no problem while grillings and socializing. The battery is amazing I have used it for 4-6 hours each time and it has not died on me yet and the sturdy construction means I can put it in the bed of the truck and not have to worry about it.<br />The weight seemed fine to me not really heavy but it does not have a top carrying handle so it will take two hands to carry in most instances.<br />The AM/FM radio signal has been good and even cranked all the way up the sound quality is good with minimal distortion.<br /><br />I would suggest this item
