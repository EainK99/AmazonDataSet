I just got these headphones in the mail a few hours ago but I can tell you you right now that these are amazing!! Plugged these into my computer threw on some music and my jaw was on the floor! The sound quality is incredible. Crystal clear! On top of that they are super comfortable! I could wear these for hours unlike some other headphones that I've owned. Other headphones start to hurt my ears after about a half an hour, but these are like having your head lightly sandwiched between to fluffy pillows! I would recommend these to anyone! Only con is that the cable is super long. However, I easily remedied that by coiling up part of the cable until it was a suitable length and then zip-tying the coil in place.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />After 3 months of daily use, these headphones are still like the first day I received them (the first part of my review)! FLAWLESS!! They sound the same. They're still as comfortable as ever. I use them for hours pretty much everyday! They are definitely the most durable and best sounding headphones I have owned to date! Still five stars!!!!!
