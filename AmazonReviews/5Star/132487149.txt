I really like this bag because:<br />It can hold all my mallets and sticks (25-30).<br />The Bag has 2 huge outer pockets that can hold music or other equipment.<br />It has large inner pockets for quick mallet changes<br />This bag also has a strap that you could put over your shoulder, but I really don't use it.<br />hangs on a keyboard instrument with ease.<br /><br />Things to look out for:<br />This bag is a lot bigger that it looks.<br /><br />This bag is amazing and I highly recommend it for anyone who is in high school or college front ensemble or who just has a lot of mallets and sticks and looking for a bigger bag. I hope this review helps.
