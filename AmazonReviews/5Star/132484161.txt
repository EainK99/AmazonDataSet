I bought this to use on company tours around our manufacturing facility. We use the handheld microphone because there are multiple people who speak during a tour. The microphone doesn't pick up the factory noise, and as long as you don't point the microphone at the speaker you won't get feedback. This is a great little speaker set for the money.
