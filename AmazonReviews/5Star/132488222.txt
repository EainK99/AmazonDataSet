I would gladly have paid twice the price for this pedal and still feel I got a good deal.  A very basic phaser unit (the only one I've ever owned so I can't compare it to others).  I'll definitely use it for recording, I'll have to see if it's suitable for gigging.  But for $24 and free shipping, you can't go wrong.
