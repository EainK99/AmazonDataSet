On my mahogany-top dreadnaught guitar the original plastic saddle and pins rendered a milky tone.  The two unwound strings lacked volume and the chime that is inherently present in other guitars.  The Tusq Saddle and Tusq pins seemed to balance the tone and volume across all of the strings.  Now the guitar is not excessively bassy at the expense of clear, well-defined highs. In my case, purchasing these was a good decision.  Also, I appreciated the quick delivery.
