This review goes out to the original combo package with power pack and an additional reel of LEDs.<br /><br />First off, you have to plug them in right to get the LEDs to power ON. Everything worked for me, unlike the other reviewers.  The strip is roughly 16 ft long with RGB LEDs that can change the colors to virtually anything you want, just like the old school projection TVs. The strip may be waterproof, but I doubt the other components or connectors are waterproof. So protect your investment by either sealing the connectors or containing them in weatherproof boxes.<br /><br />I have both reels in a linear fashion without using a y-adapter at the power source. Keep in mind that there are drawbacks to the linear configuration. The longer the reel requires more power, meaning the current  will drop as the length goes on. So in my linear configuration the White modes look great on the first reel and the second starts to fade into a green. Which is fine since all the solid colors show up just fine on its own. One other thing, you can use a staple gun with 14mm staples to staple the LED strip down. Be careful when you're taking this route, I accidentally nailed a diode for the blue light. The good thing is that the diode only controls a section of 3 LEDs. You can always cut and paste the strip to make it shorter or longer.
