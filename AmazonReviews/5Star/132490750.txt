At this point I am obsessed with this, I did so much research and it has truly paid off!!!! Here is what I have learned (or guessed from what I have read).  This guy, Joel Kennedy, the best I can figure about 30-40 years old was unhappy with the crappy violins his students were bringing in for lessons.  They call them VSO's (Violin Shaped Objects).  So he found a source in his travels to China, to make a violin that is affordable but made to his standards.    Again this is what I have learned, or guessed, violins under $100 dollars are VSO's, made with plywood and lacquer finished to look like a violin.  We bought our beginner violin for around $260 from Kennedy Violins.  It is made from tight grained spruce wood from the Himalayas, maple, and a second grade ebony (but still a really high grade).  These are the proper materials for a violin to be made out of.  The finish of her violin is hand rubbed oil finish (I think my favorite quote from them is \\"lacquer is great finish for furniture, not an acoustic instrument\\").    Took her violin today to a friend who is a strings player and he was impressed that it was a really good beginners' instrument with a strong sound.    Look them up, or buy it here, they do all the set up, go to youtube and you will find alot more about then!!!! Oh and the the customer sevice is AMAZING!!! (Heather ROCKS!!)    PS, this is my first review ever, I like them that much!!!    UPDATE... We just bought a Louis Carpini G2 Violin from them.  We are keeping our Bunnel because we still love this violin, but after practicing at least 20 min. a day 7 days a week, the Carpini G2 has the next step my daughter needs. This violin store that Joel has set up is just what we want.  He claims that he will sell you the  best violin that you can buy (at each price point).  So far I have to agree.
