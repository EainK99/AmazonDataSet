As expected from Fender, a well built, nice looking guitar.  Very little set up required upon delivery.  Action and intonation were on the money, just had to raise the PU's slightly.  Quality components, the custom shop PU's sound good and the gears are smooth.  Stays in tune well.  Nice SKB molded case for Fender, strap, cable, and tools included.  Satisfied with purchase and would recommend.
