I've tried 3 kinds of Hohner, 2 kinds of Seydel, and one kind of Suzuki, and the Seydel Noble is my favorite harp (well, maybe tied with Hohner Crossover).  I own two, in A and Eb.<br /><br />The comb is aluminum, which adds a nice heft to it.  And on an aesthetic note, the black aluminum with Seydel laser-engraved on the back is pretty sexy.  Also sexy, the matted finish to the coverplates.  In addition to the coverplates looking good, there's the added benefit that they don't collect fingerprints as easily as typical cover plates.<br /><br />But enough about looks, you can find out how it looks yourself (warning: one gaze upon it and you will be carrying its child).  You want to know how it plays.<br /><br />As far as playability goes, these are great.  The holes are slightly further apart than the average harp, with slightly rounded (but still mostly square) holes.  Hitting single notes may be a bit easier this way for some people.  The harp bends as easily as you'd expect from a high end harp.  It's very responsive.<br /><br />Lots of harp manufacturers like to brag about the materials used for the comb and etc., and the Noble is no exception to this, citing \\"German silver reed plates\\" and stainless steel reeds.  For the most part, it's handy to remember that these are harps, not Harry Potter wands.  Most of these things aren't going to make a huge difference in the sound.  The stainless steel reeds are an exception, since they're supposed to last longer and help to justify the only drawback of this harp: the price.  And while I don't believe for a second that the German silver reedplates make a difference in the sound, you know what does?  The coverplate design.<br /><br />The coverplates are open in the back and vented on the sides, and after trying a harp with a similar design (the Hohner Crossover, which is also exceptional), I'm completely sold on open coverplate designs.  It makes a real difference in volume and sound.  After playing harps like this I don't want to go back to playing more closed-off models, which sound dull and muddy in comparison.  Where the Noble has an advantage over the other harp like this I've tried is that the coverplates still feel very sturdy, while the coverplates of other harps like this feel a bit flimsy (which I'll admit doesn't make a huge difference, since even plates that feel flimsy should hold up ok unless you're holding your harp very wrong.  But still, sturdy feels nice).<br /><br />Both of my Seydel Nobles sound perfect out of the box, not one thing out of place.  The tuning is perfect, the plates are perfectly straight, the aluminum is perfectly smooth, not rough.  The harps live up to the strict standards Seydel claims to have, unlike other German harpmakers that boast about craftsmanship, but ship harps with crooked cover plates and reeds that rattle, not naming names...  Oh, and unlike the other Seydel model I have (Blues Session Steel), this is absolutely mustache friendly.  Seriously, the Noble just all around crafted to perfection in sound and design.<br /><br />I wouldn't say these are harps for beginners because 1--the price, obviously, and 2--there are no numbers above the holes.  Not an issue for veterans, but someone just learning would prefer numbers, I'm sure (incidentally, if you've been playing a while but are still using the numbers as a crutch, you'll find after playing these that you probably know the holes by memory better than you thought you did).  But if you've been playing a little while and are ready to treat yourself and splurge on something expensive (but still relatively affordable), the Noble should be on your short list of models to try.
