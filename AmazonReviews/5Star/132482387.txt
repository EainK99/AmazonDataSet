Outside of a vintage Show Bud volume pedal - this is possibly the finest volume pedal on the market today.<br /><br />Very smooth and accurate - I like the feel of this unit - and the sound is transparent - I cannot tell if it is in or out of my signal path.<br /><br />I run this volume pedal AFTER my pedal board at this time - I have a dirty pedal, delay, chorus and tuner on the board at this time. But I am upgrading to a larger pedal board soon - and will place the volume after the dirty pedals and before the delay and chorus pedals at that time.<br /><br />The pedal is heavy - sturdy - thick rubber pad on top - nice rubber the bottom that covers the entire underneath of the pedal.<br /><br />Built like a tank - brushed finish - connections on the front.<br /><br />It is very big - I wear an 11 1/2 shoe and it fits my foot very well - so this is not for a small pedal board.<br /><br />There is a tension adjustment on this unit so the end user can dial the feel of the pedal in to his or her liking.<br /><br />If you need a volume pedal just buy this one - you won't be sorry.<br /><br />******************************************<br /><br />Just as a reference I have used an Ernie Ball - the one with the string - and the Morley volume pedal - this Dunlop Volume pedal is finer than the other two - the fit, finish, sound, feel while using it, ease of use and build quality far exceed any other pedal on the market today.
