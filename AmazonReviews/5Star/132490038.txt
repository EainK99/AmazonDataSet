I bought this tube along with a Groove Tubes 12AX7 to replace the stock tubes in my little Bugera V5 practice amp. I was looking for some nice high gain units, and these guys really fit the bill. I like to set the amp up to where it breaks up quickly under moderate to hard attack, but sits right at the threshold of overdrive when picked/strummed more gently. The stock tubes just didn't quite do what I wanted them to, and the GTs do it very well indeed. I also spend a lot less time fiddling with the amp controls now since the new tubes are much more responsive to the guitar's volume knob.<br /><br />After hearing the difference these tubes have made in the little amp, I can say with some certainty that I'll be buying more Groove Tubes when my big Fender rig is in need.
