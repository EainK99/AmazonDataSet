Pack of four picks. Nationals have been around for ages and in my opinion work just fine. I used Showcase 41s for a long time and they were fine too. I don't think you need to spend a lot of money on exotic picks unless you are convinced they will really make you play or sound better. I've used finger (and thumb) picks for 46 years and haven't noticed much difference. If you want to bend the Nationals to conform to the curve of your fingers use a thin dish towel and a pair of pliers, that way you won't scratch the surface of the picks. Have fun!
