We bought these red LED strips to run along the top of the upper cabinets after a kitchen remodel.  It took quite a bit of experimenting because of different cabinet heights, but we eventually got a nice \\"soft glow\\" effect by connecting 7.5 volt power supply bricks to some strip segments and 6 volt supplies to others, depending on how close they were going to be to the ceiling.  Use 12 volts if you want something visible in daytime.  6 volts is a practical minimum; they do light up with 5, but barely.<br /><br />If you know how to strip and solder wires, then you will not have to worry about extensively researching and matching power plugs and adaptors.  These strips have designated cut-points spaced after every third light, and on each side of those cut-points is a pair of solder pads clearly marked with + and - signs.<br /><br />Pro installers will want at least ten times this much money just for the materials, and at these low voltages you aren't going to blow circuit breakers or burn down your house.  It's a great medium for experimenting with the look of a room if you have time and want to exercise some creativity.
