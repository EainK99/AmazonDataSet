I will start by saying this isn't the turntable for hardcore audiophiles, but for anyone on a budget who appreciates vinyl this one is straight up perfect.  Although some people say that Crosely is a better buy for under $100 (mostly because you don't have to buy separate speakers) this is definitely not true.  Crosely's styluses will ruin your vinyl.  So, for starter vinyl enthusiasts this table is wonderful.  Just plug in some solid computer speakers or, if you're more dedicated to a better sound quality, buy a receiver and some stereo speakers to get that audiophile quality.  This works exceedingly well, doesn't take long to set up, and has adapters for different speakers (plus a mono/input switch).  Also, it has a built-in pre-amp.  So, go for it.  It's definitely worth the money and one of the best buys I've ever had.
