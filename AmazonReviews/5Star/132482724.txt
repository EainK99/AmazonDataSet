This is the perfect shoulder rest if you don't want to spend a lot of money. It's adjustable both on the violin for positioning it on the violin for your comfort, and in the height you can achieve by adjusting the screws' height. You won't be disappointed with this rest. It seems to be well made, sturdy, and comfortable on the shoulder. I've been using it for several months and have had no problems.
