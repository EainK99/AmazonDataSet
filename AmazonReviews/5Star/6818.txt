It works great. Has a better fit on fatter necks (Gibson) than thin necks (Ibanez) but still clamps down clean. I bought this to facilitate different tunings and to flip a 7-string tuned standard to a C and C# tuning and I can say it does cover the low end frets of a 7 string Ibanez. (Just tuned the 3rd string up a half step and boom!). One handed operation works best on the Gibson style neck but with a little fidgeting it works on the wizard necks just as well. (Had to place it a little further from the fret wire). Looks sharp, super light, and a solid feeling build. Definitely worth the cash.
