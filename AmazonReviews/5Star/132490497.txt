This is a must have for you drummers that are like me, that have blown your ears out over the years being around loud music.<br />I can tune my drums by ear but when it comes to getting all the lugs the same I have trouble.<br />I use the dial to do that for me and it does a perfect job.<br />Tip: When you get the sound you want from each drum head write the number down on the head with a sharpie.
