We took a chance based on the reviews and are happy to report that we are in our third year of using this instrument in an award-winning grade school concert band.  We did buy a better neck strap and Yamaha 4C mouthpiece per reviewer recommendations.  However, it is my understanding that upgrading the mouthpiece may no longer be needed for recent units as they now include an improved mouthpiece.  If you don't want to commit to a more expensive model, this one is great for a beginner plus a few years further into concert band.
