Perfect! Does exactly what I bought it to do. Protect my Epiphone SG much better than a gig bag and at a very reasonable price. The fit is perfect. The price isn't much more than a gig bag but the protection for your instrument is so much better. Just as a point of reference, I have a TKL case protecting a different guitar. While this case is not quite the quality or protection of a TKL case, it is half the price and is more than enough protection for most applications outside travel.
