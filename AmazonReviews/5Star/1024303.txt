Absolutely didn't expect this pedal to sound as good as it does. Its definitely the big brother to the DS-1 and so much more. The distortion on turbo 1 mode is very articulate and doesn't get muddy. Lots of gain on the pedal so there is plenty of head room. Build is tank solid me the orange knobs on orange metal is very cool. Highly recommended. Glad I added this to my Boss Pedal collection.<br /><br />Matthew G.<br />Sherman, Texas
