This would be a great pedal at twice the cost.  It's my &#34;always on&#34; pedal.  Very versatile.  I've been playing over 40 years and this TS clone rocks.  I also own the Joyo digital delay, ultimate octave and extreme metal (which are also all very good pedals).  Nice solid metal case, everything works like it should.  If you've got the $$ by all means buy the original TS808 (which this is a clone of).  Or buy this and have enough left over to buy 4 - 5 more.
