I wasn't sure what I really expected out of this product, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I purchased this set of bridge pins to go on my Epiphone EF 500 RNS Masterbilt.  It brightened the tone of the guitar just a smidgen, but most importantly, improved my tuning stability.  Fit the bridge plate perfectly, and there is zero movement of the strings once set, other than the normal settling that occurs with new strings.  And the brass color really goes well with the gold hardware on that guitar.  Plus, they all sit at the same level, which is important to me and my OCD.
