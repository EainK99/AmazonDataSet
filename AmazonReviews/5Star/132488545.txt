This stand folds up easily and is all one piece with the exception of the small base plate that slides in as the shelf to hold music.  It's lightweight and comes with it's own small carrying bag.  It's also very sturdy, can be used to hold an entire binder of music, and stays up even outside in the wind.  The height and angle adjustments are simple and hold well.  Very quick and simple to set up, take down and transport.  So glad we choose this stand!
