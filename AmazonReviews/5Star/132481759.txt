I have tried numerous other cables and always had to deal with a buzz to the amp. Our local music store had me convinced it was in the wiring of my home, but after trying this cable (a brand they don't carry) the buzz is completely eliminated.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing any other brand of cable from now on.
