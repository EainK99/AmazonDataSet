The Bluetooth connectivity works great. Awesome addition to an awesome speaker. Hammered these things for 8-10 hrs on the weekend and they performed awesome. i have been using them for a month now and everyone loves the sound. Great Bass and great highs as well. VERY satisfied with this product. I DJ and KJ as a hobby for private house parties and these things ROCK !!
