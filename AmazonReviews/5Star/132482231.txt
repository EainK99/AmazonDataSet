This is the best guitar strap I've ever used.  The cotton is very comfortable, with just a little bit of stretch, and isn't slippery like the polypropolene straps.  The locking ends have never marred the finish, and have never failed to lock properly.  Unlike some other locking systems, no modification to the guitar is required, and the strap can easily be moved to almost any other guitar (the locking mechanism isn't compatible with some strap buttons).
