I purchased this pedal after stumbling over a review of it on youtube.  Check out &#34;intheblues&#34; on youtube if you're still interested.  This box is intended to be an amp simulator, but I keep reading more and more reviews of guys who are actually using this pedal into their AC30 to get some nice breakup at low volumes.  I use this pedal after my wah and right before my Visual Sound Open Road overdrive and they play sooo nice together.  The &#34;voice&#34; knob acts like somewhat of a mid-boost, and also adds grit when you turn in up, but if you keep it at about 1 o'clock or before, it keeps a very nice chime sound.  For the price, this is a bargain pedal with some amazing tone.  It really brought my amps to life!
