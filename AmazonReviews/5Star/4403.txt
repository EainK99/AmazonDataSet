Comfortable strap. White gets dirty (especially if it is rubbing on a sweaty neck), but that is an issue with the color, not the actual product, so I can't fault them for that. I worry about the metal adjustment piece scratching/chipping my bass (especially in the case), but it hasn't so far. Overall, though, the quality is as good as name brand straps, and it is a fraction of the price. And it is much more comfortable than the cheap nylon garbage.
