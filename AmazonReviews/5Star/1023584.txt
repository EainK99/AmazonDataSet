I love this mic!!!! Seriously a great buy and I'm super satisfied with my purchase.<br />You might need to use ASIO drivers with some program's but it works for sure!!! ABSOLUTLEY nothing bad to say about this! It has great sound, it picks up every little thing- I'm recording (currently) singing with it turned down to .05 and I still hear myself clear! If you have a home studio or whatever get this!!! Great for the price!
