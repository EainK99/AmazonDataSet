I Was skeptical at first to buy a Slap Top Cajon due to me wondering how it could produce the same sound as a traditional cajon.  But I loved the fact of it sitting in my lap instead of under me.<br />Upon purchasing I was amazed at the sound and the response to finger rolls.  It is also very comfortable and convenient to hold.  I am extremely satisfied with this product.  Now all that is left is to see how durable it is over a long time..  GREAT JOB MEINL for trying something different..
