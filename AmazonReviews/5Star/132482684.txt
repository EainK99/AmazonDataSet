15 inches. Measured it.<br /><br />The shofar works. It looks real nice.<br /><br />Got this from Israel just as fast as if it were shipped from the USA.<br />Wrong. The shofar, I assume it is made in Israel because it has a stamp on it that states Israel but mailed/shipped from Buffalo, NY.<br /><br />Bargain! Bargain!<br /><br />Am thinking about a kudo shofar about 3 feet long. As far as this shofar's size, it is the right size for its use as a warning system in ancient times.<br /><br />The shofar is real good for working one's lungs.
