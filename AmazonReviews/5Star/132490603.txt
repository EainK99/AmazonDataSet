This thing is well built!  The case is as solid as any stage amp...no plastic sides / handle or cheap trim here.  I got it for portability and it is.  Roland hit the mark for a professional quality in a small package.  I haven't used the battery option much yet, but it will be handy to have.  I'm using it for a Boss drum machine and it sounds great!<br /><br />Update:  I’ve had is for 3 years now and still love it.  Its very handy for solo gigs / smaller rooms where I don’t need big volume.  Battery powered, it works great.
