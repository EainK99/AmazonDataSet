I would like to state first and foremost the Virtual DJ software that comes with is outdated.<br /><br />Though if you register the Keycode with Virtual DJ on their website, a more recent download is available.<br /><br />This controller does not play nice with Virtual DJ pro (seems to only partially function with one deck and the mixing console, The LE software is actually better than the Pro full version for this controller where it enables you to use both decks. However this can be fixed by advanced midi mapping as the maps included for download with pro are limited compared to the LE version of the software the device more than likely will come with. *note*<br /><br />Its innovation is the reason this device gets a 5 as you can use one of the scratch pads for quick ques etc. Its actual functionality the star rating should be a 3.<br /><br />It is interesting to play with, this device had so much potential but sadly it isn't a focus point for Stanton anymore. Key point with traktor stanton has washed their hands and gone solely to VDJ. I also think it might because of the Darouter software and this device is the reason Traktor and stanton no longer seem to have a working relationship.<br /><br />DaRouter software interface is no longer needed for this device to interface with Virtual DJ.<br /><br />For what you are paying 99.99 for this item you can't go wrong. as you get all modules. You can't purchase them individually for this price. So if you are just wanting one piece of the this set up you might as well as buy the complete system.<br /><br />If you are trying to do something fancy with this device at a live gig hang it up. Their is some serious latency issues which can be adjuest and difficulty in setting que points would make this device impractical for a live gig attempting to do much of anything on the fly, if this device was to be used only on its own.  Best to probably couple this with another mid - high grade controllers to get the best value out of this device. (which is what I do)<br /><br />Anyway long story short. For someone on a budget that wants to toy around with djing This might be a good option for you. It will give you some of the basics, and make mixing easier then trying to fumble with a keyboard and mouse. But keep in mind this device was a forward futuristic concept that did not fully go over well that is why there is a 600+ dollar discount from when it was first initially offered. Mainly because of software interface problems.his device. (which is what I do)<br /><br />Anyway long story short.
