I'm a jazz/rock player that doesn't use a lot of pedals, and I got tired of the cords tangling up everything. A Pedaltrain with a Voodoo is overkill for me; I need something for practice, jams and a gig now and then, and I rarely use more than chorus, delay and distortion all at once. I wouldn't mind if Gator offered an upgraded carry bag for another $5-$10 but this is a lot simpler to setup than a pedal train, and there is room to mount a small power supply on the board with the vecro if you don't want to use the single adapter that comes with this board.
