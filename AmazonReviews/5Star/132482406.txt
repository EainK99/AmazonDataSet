Pros: Does a good job with realistic harmonies if you don't overdo it.  Tone button makes an audible improvement with our without harmonies.  Doubling feature is subtler than I expected, but useful.  Reverb settings are simple but great.<br /><br />Cons: Amount of compression and correction are not adjustable.  I find the buttons hard to push accurately with my feet unless I look down.<br /><br />Overall? Awesome product.
