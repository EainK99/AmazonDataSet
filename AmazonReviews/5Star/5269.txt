Perfect solution! I bought an R&B SG and the intonation was so far off with the stock bridge that I couldn't fix it. The stock neck was too far from the bridge and didn't have the travel need, so the intonation was flat as you went up the bridge on 2 or 3 strings. This bridge has a fair bit more travel to the saddles, so I was able to adjust it far enough to get it right. In addition, it was slightly lower, which allowed me to set the action lower than the stock bridge as well.<br /><br />This thing is VERY well made. Clean, no rough casting edges or anything like that. Definitely a quality piece of equipment.
