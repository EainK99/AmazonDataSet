I bought these for a block party we had the other weekend and they are AWESOME. I was a radio DJ for 12 years so I'm pretty particular about speakers and this set blew me away, especially for the price. For less than 300 bucks I get two sturdy, easy-to-handle, super loud speakers, high-quality stands, a POWERFUL built-in amp with FM tuner, Bluetooth capability, and microphone . . . really?? Yep, hard to believe but this set is top-notch and it sure beats the heck out of the old school setup of separate components that were impossible to haul around. Makes me want to have a block party every weekend. Two words: BUY IT.
