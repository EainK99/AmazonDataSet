So I got this guitar for free and I thought it was a bad guitar but boy was I wrong!. This guitar sounds amazing! looks good, feels good, and most of all sounds great! If your looking for a guitar that will not burn a hole in your money then this guitar is the right choice!<br />The only thing I did was put new pickups in it only cuz Im a huge EMG fan and have EMG pickups in all my guitars so of course I put some in this one and I put different inlays on it cuz I'm not a fan of dots lol but before I did any of that its an Awesome guitar before and a must have!!
