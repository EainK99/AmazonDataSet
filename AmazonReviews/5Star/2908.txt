This is definitely a product for the high end hobbiest or starting professional.<br /><br />First, it uses an XLR microphone connector with potential for 48 mV phantom power.  This is not going to be your first mic if you are starting out.<br /><br />Second, the jacks are all 1/4&#34;.  Most consumer items come in 1'8&#34; jacks and plugs.<br /><br />I previously owned a TASCAM iUR2 that worked well with my IPad2 until the IOS outran the iUR2 ability to interface.<br /><br />Here are a few Q/A topics to talk through the capabilities of the device.<br /><br />How hard was it to set-up?  It was simple.  You unwrap it, grab your mic, iPad, and iPad power adapter, and you plug them in.<br /><br />Does it run off of the iPad's power? No, you plug the iPad into the iOne using the regular iPad to USB cable.  The power comes from plugging in the mini-USB connector from the iOne to the power supply for the iPad's USB jack.<br /><br />What is the sound quality like?  It is OK.  Most mics need to be run through a pre-amp to get the volume up into the workable range.  I was able to import the CAF files produced into ProTools at 48Khz and 16bits of fidelity.  With that level of detail, I was able to increase the volume, filter, compress, etc. with reasonable results.<br /><br />Is the device compatible with a variety of software packages?  I was able to use it both on my PC and my iPad.  The truth is that I have many other recording options for my PC.  I got the iOne for use with my iPad.  I did not have a good way to record high quality sound since the iUR2 became obsolete.<br /><br />OK, you told me the good things. Do you have any areas where it could be improved?  Sure.  First, you can import the tracks produced by using iTunes, but the audio files are all in CAF format, not AIF, not WAV, not MP3 or MP2, not in ...  Well, you get the idea.  Most of my sound packages could not read the files.  Apparently, you can download to your computer and then reload into iTunes and ship back to your iPad and read using Garage Band to then export as a sound file that is a little more standard.  Fortunately, my copy of ProTools was able to read the file and import it.  Many of you are not going to have a copy of ProTools sitting around.<br /><br />I've heard that it is hard to get information from IOne to other music programs.  Is that true?  There is an export button in the program, but it is looking for a copy of Studio One.  There are no other immediately obvious export options from inside the program.  That said, I just plugged my iPad into iTunes and was able to download the CAF files right away.<br /><br />Pros: one of the few professional recording capabilities that just uses an iPad or iPhone.  The sound quality is good (48 KHz and 16 bits), but quiet.  You will need to do some editing/production work on it.  The device is easy to set-up and start using immediately.<br /><br />Cons: The CAF format for the sound files is not one of the most common.  It might be tricky to convert CAF to AIF, WAV, or MP3 files.  There are minimal instructions that came with the device and not much on-line.  You will need quarter inch plugs with everything to make it work.back to your iPad and read using Garage Band to then export as a sound file that is a little more standard.
