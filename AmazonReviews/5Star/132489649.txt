Great Bass for the Money. Basically a Fender American Standard without the string through Body Bridge( which has not been on the Jazz that many years). Grease Bucket Tone control (should come on the American Standard) cleans up and really focuses the low end. Slim C neck (should be offered on the American Standard) Slimmer but not far from the Original Jazz Neck. Gig bag no Hard Case.<br /><br />This Bass is Heavy(feels heavier than a American Standard)(Tuners????), Beefy with loads of sustain. Fit and Finish(Excellent).<br />Colors are limited to four.Candy Apple, White, Sunburst, Black/Maple with Parchment PG is very cool in person and thats what I have. The pickups are not the custom shop 60's but they are not cheap sounding like a MIM. It has that American Jazz fit feel and enhanced sound which is cleaner than an American Standard.<br /> This is better than a Highway One. its more of a strip down American standard. Same high quality neck but slimmer w/o the rolled edges. Electronics are the large pots and thick wire. They cut the price but not the quality. Really a great playing, great sounding Fender American Bass. One of their best, no gimmicks or mixed 70's neck with Baadass bridge. Just the sound is really very clean and focused and honest. That classic Jazz Bass sound but actually is improved(if that's possible). Check it out.....
