My back ground experience in music has always been piano and though I took lessons several years back when I decided to pick up violin again I found tuning to be difficult. Even with a pretty good ear stringed instruments are tuned differently than piano and organ and since im mostly a choral singer I never felt confident my tuning was correct.<br /><br />To use this its best to mess with the swivel until you can see the display whilst it's clipped to a peg. I love it. It's simple to use and I've even adjusted it so I can clip it on while playing and see if my fingering is correct. I bought one for my niece and she says her instructor uses one as well. A great tool!!!
