I'm always looking for the best deal in headphones. I have a few that are considered up there- Koss Porta Pros, some Senneheisers, the Grado 125's... and somehow I just found out about these a couple months ago through an article on Wire Cutter, when they named them the best headphone under $150.<br /><br />That was pretty remarkable considering they were almost half that- about $78 on sale when I got 'em here on Amazon. The closed (i.e., sound doesn't leak) design and coiled cord makes them more practical than the Grados. And both the structural design (especially the soft ear pads) and the sound itself (I found the sound of the Sonys less harsh and sibilant). Though the Grados have more 'punch' to the bass and a little more detail overall, I think this is the more balanced, true-to-the-source headphone. It's easy to see why they're the industry standard in recording studios around the world.<br /><br />I almost ended up getting the Audio Technicha ATH-M50, but after reading the Wire Cutter article, I got these instead. And at nearly half the price, I'm glad I did. These aren't a pair of headphones that will &#34;enhance&#34; the music you're listening to (like the M50's) through beefed-up bass; these cans will just give you a detailed, unbiased picture of the source: nothing more; nothing less. To some folks used to that sound,  they might think the Sonys sound &#34;recessed&#34; because their frequency balance is so remarkably flat.<br /><br />In summation: These are cans for music fans who just wanna listen to the music, not the headphones.
