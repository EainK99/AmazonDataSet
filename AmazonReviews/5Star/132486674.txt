This is a great product for the Chauvet ShowExpress lighting designer program. I used this for a youth camp and it did what I needed. Very simple, just plug in the 3-pin DMX to the controller, then plug the USB into your computer. It controlled about 15 LED's, 2 movers and 1 laser. Everything is really easy to program, and I love the 3D visualizer that came with it. I could pre-program on the before I get to the event. This is a great buy!
