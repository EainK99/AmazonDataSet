My room is a rave. The colors are beyond bright enough and beautiful to stare into and zone out, plus they don't generate really any heat because they're LEDs. THEY DO CHANGE WITH MUSIC. You just gotta make sure that the sensor (little black box) is near enough to your speaker that it can detect the bass.
