My brother has been playing drumset for many years.  He would always leave his sticks scattered on the floor and if he dropped or broke one while playing he would have to stop playing and bend over to pick another up.  Naturally a stick bag seemed the proper solution.  I got him this bag over a year ago and hes has been using it ever since.  The sticks aren't scattered everywhere and he loves it.<br /><br />If the bag wont maintain shape it is helpful to wedge a plastic jar lid or something circular roughly the same shape as the bag into the bottom.  I did not have this problem but I see how it could be helpful.
