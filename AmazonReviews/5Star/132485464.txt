I love it! I've had this controller for 3 weeks now and I could not be happier with it! I use this along side my Mixtrack Pro. The main reason I bought this controller cause the play button on my Mixtrack Pro is broken. I recommend this controller to anyone Traktor user! Very handy and very fun! Not to mention it gets a lot of attention!
