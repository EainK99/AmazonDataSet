I want to state upfront that I'm an ongoing, but not terribly accomplished student of the violin, however I am a dedicated one.  I have an aversion to shoulder rests because, like the rest of my life, desire to keep my violin practice as uncomplicated as possible.  When I've tried using a shoulder rest it always felt cumbersome and intrusive - an unwelcome presence between myself and my violin.  I've been using a standard JSI Guarneri chinrest for quite a while.  However, I've also always had issues with the mechanics of holding my violin and this seemed to be stemming from the chinrest.  Although, not terribly uncomfortable I never felt like I had the stability I needed at that end of things.  My neck is somewhat on the long side of average, but I guess I'm not exactly a stork either.  I had read a bit about the Varga chinrest and thought it worth a try if there was a chance it might make a difference.  I like the Guarneri form in general and didn't want to stray too far from it, which the Varga does not.  The only significant difference I can see is that it is a full 1/4 inch higher.  And that turns out to be a wonderful difference indeed!  I've only had it on my instrument two days and there is a marked improvement in the stability I feel when holding and playing my violin. For the price, if you're having some of the same issues, I highly recommend giving the Varga a try.
