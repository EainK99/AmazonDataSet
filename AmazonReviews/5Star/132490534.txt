I have an Epiphone PR150S steel string acoustic that had a plastic non-compensated saddle. It was relatively easy to sand some of the thickness from this new saddle with 80 grit paper that I had. I sanded the ends some so it would just fit snug. I strung the fourth string and sanded the bottom of the saddle a lot until a quarter would slide snugly between the string and twelfth fret. Restringing it maybe four times. I have not replaced the nut yet because it would not come free easily. New Ernie Ball strings and this guitar has never sounded close to this good or been so easy to play. I am very happy with the product and it arrived just when it was scheduled.
