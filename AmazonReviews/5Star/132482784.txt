I had two turn signal bulbs that were out on both sides of my car. When I removed the housing for the bulbs, I found the contacts to be covered in corrosion and the contacts on the bulb were so brittle they fell off when I pulled them out! I squirted some of this in a couple of times a day for 4 days, while letting it dry out in between applications, and put new bulbs in; voila, everything worked without having to rewire the socket. Great!!! Saved me money and time.
