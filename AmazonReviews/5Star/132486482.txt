I am never dissapointed with Takamine. This must be the 5th Tak I have owned, but the less expensive of them all, especially at the bargain price on Amazon. Saw it, loved the way it looked, and bought it here on Amazon (whose service by the way is always excellent) sight unseen and having never tried it. Contrary to some reviews here, mine looks really nice with no blemishes whatsoever. I did experience the foam stuck in the jack upon unpacking (as did another reviewer), and the fastest and easiest way for me to take it out was to suck it out. Took 2 seconds to clean it up... To be honest, still today I am not quite sure what the wood conbinations are. I know they are laminate and have the appearance of maple, but to be precise I do not know. What I do know is that it sounds really nice with some Tayloresque highs. The sound is full and the guitar loud. Again extremely happy with my Takamine purchase, and beau-ti-ful guitar! Very nice just to contemplate. Amazon makes returns easy, try it, you got nothing to lose and chances are you will keep...
