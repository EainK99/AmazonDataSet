I have the Seagull Entourage Black CW GT QI, and bought this case to tote it around in. The case is very nice and high quality. I will say that the fit is EXTREMELY snug... there is no extra space whatsoever, and it first it seems like the guitar is too thick to close the case, but in fact it does snugly close over it. I've only had hard cases before, but I suppose this is exactly what you want in a good soft case.<br /><br />The material is high quality and the look is exceptional. The guitar feels well protected for basic carrying needs (I wound't check it on an airplane though).
