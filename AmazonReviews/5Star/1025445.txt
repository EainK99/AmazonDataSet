DAC Conversion is great. Driver is rock solid. The  preamps maybe not as good as my focusrite Forte. But the latency is incredibly low and I'm satisfied with the audio quality and features. It's the only small, affordable USB 3.0 interface that Im aware of. Haven't tested with windows 10 yet. But works great on Win 8.1
