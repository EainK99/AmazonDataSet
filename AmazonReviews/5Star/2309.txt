After spending a fair amount of money getting my guitars set up, I decided I was going to get a basic set of guitar tools and learn to do it myself.  All I really needed at the moment was a way to measure string action, I wont be doing any fret or nut work at the moment, and there are other tools that are perhaps similar, but as soon as I opened the package up I knew I had made a good choice, this thing oozes precise and is very well constructed.  It's super easy to get a precise bead on your string action. It's nice to know that this tool will be there if I ever take my guitar repairing to the next level and get to use some of the other features of this great little tool.
