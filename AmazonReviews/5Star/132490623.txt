Don't that price fool you. This pedal by Berhringer has a very good sound and I recommend it. Hey, not all of us can dish out the big bucks for pedals and I have four Behringers and all work beautifully. I'm sure a lemon squeezes by once ever so often. Heck even a top of the line product can have flaws. Everyone has there idea of what a particular pedal should sound like and for me the Behringer BO300 Blues Overdrive does the trick. Totally adjustable sound from a Billy Gibbons style Texas twang to a mellow bluesy tone. I recommend it for at home or garage player and believe you really can't go wrong with the pedal.
