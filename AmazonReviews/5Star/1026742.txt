These are great key clamps for ANY saxophone. I've got mine because my vintage Olds Parisian (Peirot) was leaking after a full pad replacement. Not only it allowed for the new pads to crease to correct 'groove' but also kept the pads sitting on the right position, which is essential after a repad job.<br />Keep in mind that this is a universal key clamp and should fit almost all saxes. If you understand just enough about Saxes you know that key cup positioning, Rods, etc.. varies greatly among horns from different manufactures. That said, depending what horn you own, it may require you to 'slightly' bend, pry, twist, adjust the keys to properly fit your particular horn. Although I've been using this primarily for my 3 tenor saxes I can potentially fit and clamp for all my other horns (I own 7 saxes, from Baritone to Soprano).<br /><br />This clamps are perfect for traveling or when the horn is sitting on it's case for any period of time. Since I've started using these clamps on my MKVI I haven't had leaking pads issues. I highly recommended it.
