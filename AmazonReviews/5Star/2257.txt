Fender picks: Some years ago Fender picks changed their shape,they were a bit pointier and had a little scratchier sound,but these made in China picks ,at least the ones I bought, are back to the original more rounded tip that I like.They wear very well like they had been polished without the rough edges at all.I have the premium celluloid in white perloid,red,purple and tortoise shell and they are great,the abalones are very good too.The tortoise shell are exactly the same as the Martin celluloid ,just as the old ones,perhaps you got some bad ones from some years back,but the new ones they sell now everywhere are as good as the old ones.
