My daughter wanted me to buy her a new shoulder rest for awhile now because the one that came in with her violin was small, hard and slipping.  So we bought her this and she was very happy with it.  She said that some of her classmates have the same one and this one curves on the shoulder for proper support and not slipping when she plays.  She can hold her violin with just her chin down on it without a hand because of the great support and she can do vibrato now too because it's not slipping anymore.
