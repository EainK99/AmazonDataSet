Received the guitar yesterday afternoon and the packing job was well done.  The guitar was packed inside the guitar box placed inside another larger box with packing paper.  Took it out for inspection and didn't see any knicks or issues with the guitar.  First impressions would be that this is a really nice guitar, I ordered the metallic blue one.  It has some weight to it and the neck seems solid.  I haven't tuned it yet but plan to order some fender pickups to replace the ones it came with. When I get the new pickups placed in it I will get it \\"set up\\" by a tech so that it is just right.  Hope to start playing it in December or so.  Nice guitar and really nice price!
