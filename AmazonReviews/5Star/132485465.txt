I don't see how you could be disappointed in the reverb or tonal character from this big box. It is a pleasure<br />to play and very sensitive to new string changes which you will immediately hear. The feel and action are flawless<br />along with a nice ring and percussive snap all the way up the board minus the harsher overtones you can get with  some acoustics. You get some super kick-ass projection from the bass strings with this size guitar.<br /><br />This bad boy, the Seagull s6 -along with-  some others in this price range are category killers; so its likely that<br />your local dealer won't have it on display or will mismatch strings to it.<br /><br />The \\"nano mag\\" pickup on this matched to the right amp will bring you closer to electric guitar tones.<br /><br />God bless those Indonesians that worked their magic into this piece of wood.
