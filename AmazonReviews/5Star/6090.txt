I'm addicted to headphones. I can't help it. I'm always testing the new ones when I see them on display. Every now and then I feel the itch to splurge on a new pair but nothing under the $500 mark compares to these. The only time I use a different pair is when I need noise cancellation. BUT, that famous brand noise canceling set that I own (and love for different reasons) simply doesn't compare with sound quality.<br /><br />If these are your first higher end headphones, do a simple test. Use the headphones to play a song you know by heart. I promise that you'll aspects of the song you never heard before using these.
