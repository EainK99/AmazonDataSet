This SKB medium hardware case is a monster! It is a little heavy, but man you can fill it up with all the hardware you need – plus a few extras and it won’t even whimper. I especially like the retractable handle and wheels – I’ve used it  as luggage and as a quasi hand truck to haul other non-percussion stuff. It is simply awesome.
