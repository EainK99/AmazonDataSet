I was looking for a quality set of over the ear headphones and did a lot of research. I ended up buying these headphones for $100 on Black Friday. At first I'll admit I was skeptical because I hadn't heard of the company before but now I cannot speak highly enough of these headphones. I have had them for almost a year and they continue to perform very well. The audio quality is fantastic,they are very comfortable and offer good .<br /><br />I know people buy Dre's headphones but from what I have seen you will pay more and get less in terms of sound quality. The main reason I didn't purchase a set of Dre's was because they focus on the bass too much and I listen to a wide variety of music (including hip-hop and rap). These offer great quality audio and the wide range I was looking for.<br /><br />Finally, I dealt with their repairs/warranty department and was very impressed. I dropped my computer (twice) with the headphones plugged in and it landed right on the connection (twice) and snapped the second time I dropped it. It snapped not for lack of quality but because it landed just right. Anyway I sent in the headphones ready and willing to pay for the repair. I was pleasantly surprised to see them honor my request to replace the whole cable from coiled to straight AND under the warranty!<br /><br />There is nothing bad I can say about the company or the set of headphones. This company has forever earned my business for headphones, microphones, and other audio equipment.
