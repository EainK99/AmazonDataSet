Very well made little shaker.  Easy to take along in the car to amuse ourselves on long car trips.  Small enough to tuck away under the seat or in the glovebox.  Nice sound, which can be varied by how you shake it (up and down, side to side, fast, slow).  Nice for adults as well as children.  We made shakers for our young friends out of plastic containers and rice and beans, but this is much classier.  Would recommend this item to others.
