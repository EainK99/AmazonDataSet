As far as the keyboard is concerned I can't imagine wanting more than piano like keys.  The stand is far better as regards stability than I'd have thought.  The headphones came with an adapter plug so it can be used in two different size jacks.  All and all a nice bundle with more features than any sane person could hope to use in a lifetime.  Now if I can just figure some way to get the darn thing close enough to my desktop to make the USB connection to transfer songs from the included disk to the keyboard.
