I've been using these on my Fender Basses since the 70's, nothing else has this tone, I love how they cut through in rock music. This is a lighter gauge set that is easier on your fingers if you don't play a lot or if you have arthritis like I do.<br /><br />Great price here on Amazon too, our whole band is on regular delivery because we love fresh stings and great tone.<br /><br />Good music to all!
