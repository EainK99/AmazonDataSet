I have been doing live sound for 25+ years. More recently, I've been running sound each Sunday at a local church.  I have been unhappy with the sound of the sampled piano, and knew an upgrade to a Radial was probably my only choice. It was this past Sunday that I manage to find two of these units buried in a milk crate (alternate audio system for small on location events).  I just had to hear the difference between this DI, and the other inexpensive DI we were using. What was the difference? This thing made the piano sound like a real piano, and the chords were clear. The other cheap DI seemed to be muddy when chords were played. I quickly switched between the Rolls (and the other DI) in the middle of chord progressions in order to make certain I was making the right choice. I even added EQ to both DI units, and attempted to make them both sound as good as possible. I connected one of the L/R outs of the Keys to this box, and the other to the other DI. I alternated both faders up/down, and listened to the difference. The band asked me what sounded better, I responded with: The Rolls sounds like a piano.
