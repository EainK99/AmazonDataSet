Spoke to Michael, the owner.  Great technical support!!!  For your edification, guitar bridge pins are not one size fits all.  MacNichol Guitars is the only vendor that specifies the dimensions on their pins, and the only one with a technical support telephone number.  No other suppliers have their dimensions listed.  You are taking a risk ordering from other vendors.
