Pros:<br />I am an occasional Dj and every time I got the laser every body likes it<br />Using it outdoors I counted 30 meters in distance!!!<br />Using it indoors is very bright!<br />Fell a couple of times, and still going strong!<br />Price<br /><br />Cons<br />Feels cheap<br />Tripod feels cheap too.<br />The manual states no longer than 2 hours of continuous use, I connected it for 6 hours and it still works.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The first time I got it I felt like it was a bad deal, but after connecting it, PUM! The party started!!
