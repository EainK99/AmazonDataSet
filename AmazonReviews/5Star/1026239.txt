An excellent program that I can recommend to people who are looking to learn or improve how to play the saxophone or flute. I purchased my first pack of the SaxMastery a year ago. Now am learning year 2, the saxophone was the first instrument I have ever played and I had no musical background but now I can read and play the saxophone.<br />Mark Bunney is dedicated to insure that you get the maximum out of the SaxMastery Course. It is affordable and Mark is a professional Saxophonist.<br /><br />Now am looking forward to year 3
