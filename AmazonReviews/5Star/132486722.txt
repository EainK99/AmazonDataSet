Clear, loud and brilliant sound.  It is a little hard on the fingers ccmpared with other instruments near the first fret, but I just lower the action.  The only problem is when you play chords loudly, the pick-guard vibrates too much making annoying noise.  This can be easily fixed by duct tape or screwing the pick-guard tight.
