great quality. you have to pop the drum pads out (one at a time) and unscrew the rims. this process is pretty easy.  once on the silencers make the drums considerably quieter, plus you get better rebound.  you won't miss any notes. if you like playing the rock band drums any of them 1,2,3, Beatles this is a must have.
