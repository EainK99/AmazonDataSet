Everyone has their own preference, of course. Not only is this one of the best-priced deals going, but the picks are very high quality and have just the right amount of \\"grippiness\\" (I may have just invented that word, not sure). There's also a good mix of the different thicknesses. At the rate I tend to lose picks, I think I might just order another package or two of these to have around. Definitely pleased with the product!
