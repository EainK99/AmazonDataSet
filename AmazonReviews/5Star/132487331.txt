Brand new wannabe bodhran player here. The \\"bodhran bug\\" struck me about 5 weeks ago, at which time I bought a tipper and a 12\\" Evans Real Feel practice pad to see if I had any potential before purchasing the real thing. Living in an apartment, the nearly silent practice pad allowed me to drum away late at night without disturbing the neighbors. During this experiment I was also doing research on what bodhran I should purchase if I made up my mind to buy one. Decisions, decisions. Tunable, or less expensive non-tunable? 14-inch, 16-inch or 18-inch? Not having a hair dryer, which is necessary to tune non-tunable bodhrans, and not wanting to buy one, I narrowed my search to tunable bodhrans. During this time I was also keeping an eye on all the bodhrans available on Amazon, reading the customer reviews, looking at YouTube bodhran videos. I decided that the 16-inch size was the right size for me and watched this particular bodhran daily for a few days, trying to determine if I really wanted to do this. All during this time the price was $75 and change. Then one day it was $80 and change! So I decided to hit the \\"Buy\\" button. About 10 minutes later I went back to look at \\"my\\" bodhran again and the price was back down to $75! I felt kind of ripped-off. Apparently the price of this item fluctuates between $75 and $80, depending on which retailer is doing the fulfillment. I think it's worth $80 but if $5 cheaper is important to you, wait until the lower price is showing. Of course there's no guarantee that the $75 price will last forever, but as of this writing it still pops up from time to time.<br /><br />The bodhran arrived today. Its appearance is very nice, both wood and skin. It seems to be well-made (made in Pakistan). Has a nice tone. I tried the tuners and they worked okay. There was enough room under the T-bar for me to slide my hand around (if you want to remove this bar, it looks like it is removable by unscrewing the screws that hold it in place). I really like the tipper that came with it, 9 1/4 inches, nice balance.<br /><br />The manufacturer's (Roosebeck) corrugated carton that it comes in is nice, and has a plastic handle for easy carrying. The seller (Springdale Music) did an excellent job with the outer shipping carton and packing material, and shipping was quick.<br /><br />An overall excellent transaction, both product and service.
