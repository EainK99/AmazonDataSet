I am a professional Hip Hop producer & I write a lot of background music for TV shows. When I work I want something easy to use & does exactly what I need done. In conjunction with Reason 7 this is my weapon of choice every time. I like the note repeat option a lot. I also enjoy the different controller banks & my absolute favorite feature is the 16 levels option. I also frequently use the Full Level function button as well. For me I have searched high & low for the right midi controller besides my keyboard midi controller & when it comes to drumbeats this is the fastest easiest way to go for me. I can bang out a hot drum track in mins & get right to the melody with this machine. Yes I did the $60 mpcstuff.com pad upgrade to thick pads but it was more than worth it in my opinion. I brag about this unit to all of my producer friends and have even swayed a few in picking up MPD32's themselves. Bottom Line, I wouldn't trade my MPD32 for anything.
