Fits my Kala KA-SMHT. Holds the instrument securely. Solid construction. The lid fits tightly. Latches are secure and operate easily. Attached feet make it stable whether it's standing on its side, on end, or on its back. Easy to carry: doesn't add too much weight to the instrument. The handle (no straps) is comfortable to grip. Color is dark brown.
