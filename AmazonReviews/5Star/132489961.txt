Along with the Rock n Roller cart this is the best purchase I have made in months.  I used my cart for one gig (wedding) and it was so much easier than a hand cart.  Using the expandable wood deck kit, i was able to transport 2 speakers, 2 turntables in cases, a mixer in a case, and several bags, including the speaker stand bag on top.  I am so happy with the roller and expanded deck that I just ordered the top shelf. If you bought the cart, I highly recommend the shelf for stability and more surface area.
