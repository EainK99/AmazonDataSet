I looked at the reviews for a few of these before choosing this one. I know some of the other reviewers had trouble getting their bowls to &#34;sing&#34;. I was very pleased when I received mine and was able to make it sing right away. I also ordered a suede covered striker and it works even better than the one that comes with it. I have found that even, fairly firm pressure while moving slowly around the outside near the rim works better than trying to go lightly and quickly. It looks great on its little poof (mine is green and yellow). I don't much care for the prayer flags, but  that's okay.
