I've used these headphones for one month and used them through one recording session.  Feels solid. Adjusts well to fit my head and ears. Wearing them for a long time has so far been pretty comfortable, with no strong desire to take them off.  Folds up easily for storage.  Sound is excellent and I'm picky being a part-time recording engineer for many years. I should report back in two years or so.<br /><br />UPDATE ~6 months after purchase: I just came through using these phones for another recording project, and the sound seems wonderful, the isolation is great, and all the components still feel solid.  Negative: the headphone plug semi-frequently pops out of my computer (MacBook Pro) and smartphone (Samsung Note II).  Wishlist: I would like to have the chord to be removable.
