My kids always want a night light all over the house when it's bed time. They would prefer if we left all the lights on but that is not happening. I love this little night like it is just bright enough too be able to see when you walk through the living room to go to the bath room. I love how it is small but packs a powerful light. This is a great product and it does have several modes i use the light off mode. So when light turns off it comes on. It takes 3 AAA which are not included. It does have 3 other modes but I haven't messed with them much as this one works wonders for our family. I got this at a discount for my unbiased review.
