I played a variety of music and videos while listening to them. The sound quality was excellent, very clear across the board, a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />Controls are excellent too, and again, work no problem on Android. One earphone has a + and - button for volume, and holding them for longer executes different functions, like skipping tracks.<br />There is one other button for power, which, when tapped will play/pause. All worked flawlessly.<br /><br />In summary, highly recommended.
