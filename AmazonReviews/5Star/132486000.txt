I picked up a 50s-era Holton Collegiate tenor for my collection. About the same time, I bought a Slickit to try. I'd used oil for decades. I had the Holton serviced (slide alignment, chem-clean, minor dent removal, new cork, etc.). I took it to church (my honey's the pianist, the best buddy a guy could have in the whole world is the Music Director [trumpeter, alas...]) one Sunday & dressed the slide according to the instructions on the small bottle. I found this very easy to use, actually AMAZING!!! After all the years that I'd used slide oil, this knocked me for a loop! Nice, fluid movement, a slight spritz every so often kept it virtually effortless.<br /><br />At the time I tended to hold my slide loosely between my right thumb & forefinger & let my wrist do the talking. Somewhere in the 3rd or 4th hymn I managed to lose my grip on the slide & launched it completely off of the horn (fortunately, onto some soft carpet about 8' away, no damage other than my bruised dignity)! Everyone (myself included) had a good snicker about it then we went about our business.<br /><br />I'm very impressed with this product but, due to my \\"flight\\", am reminded of a slogan for a certain popular 70s aftershave (initials are \\"H-K\\") - \\"Be Careful How You Use It!\\"<br /><br />This is good stuff!!!
