I wanted to try this product for a very specific application. I do social media videos for work every other week, and was looking to streamline the process a bit. Because the videos are being primarily being played on facebook, I don't need to use the really nice cameras at work. The issue, however, is that the audio quality on the lower end devices leaves much to be desired. So, I figured I'd try using the iRig PRE to replace audio on an iPhone 5 recorded video. I know the video quality isn't amazing, but it does the job I need it to do, and if I could improve the audio quality, I'd have a process that yields solid results but takes much less time, and impacts fewer people than my current process.<br /><br />I use a Sennheiser shotgun mic and mount the iPhone on a Glif mount. The setup performs wonderfully, and the sound quality using the iRig PRE is a dramatic improvement when using the standard camera app to film. The setup allows me to not take time from our video guy, as I don't need to convert the footage. I simply drop the footage with the improved audio onto the computer, trim it, add the video bumper on the front end, and export. Easy.<br /><br />There are two minor annoyances with the iRig PRE. First, I wish the gain control had some sort of marking system on it so I could get the settings where they need to be without having to do a bunch of tests each time I film. I'll likely mark it with white out or something to make that step easier, but it would have been nice to see even something as basic as numbers or stripes on the dial.<br /><br />Secondly, the monitor playback doesn't do so in stereo on my unit. Perhaps it is a wiring issue, or just a limitation of the device, but it is just a minor annoyance. I'm still able to get a reasonable assessment of the audio in one ear. Worst case, I unplug the iRig PRE from the phone and plug my headphones in directly. Not the end of the world, but slightly annoying.<br /><br />Even with those two issues, I don't feel it justifies dropping a star. The ability to use an XLR mic on my iPhone to replace the audio while recording video is simply outstanding. I've experienced very clean sound (no hiss that others are reporting), and because of that, I'm thrilled with the result.
