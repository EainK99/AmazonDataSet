I did not get this guitar from amazon,but with the amazon price I was able split the differance with my locale dealer with some goodies throwed in. Way back in 1984 I bought a Takamine and loved it and so did any advanced players that came around. Later I traded it for what I thought was trading up. I have regreted it ever since.<br />I dont play in a band or on stage but I would proudly play this guitar on stage. It looks, feels, sounds and plays like a pro series. My wife did not want me to spend the money on it ,but when she saw and heard it she knew it is worth every penny. It is truely a beautiful guitar. It stays on a perfect 440. I can always tell when it vibrates through my body and make my teeth rattle. It is so full of sound when it is tuned it sounds as if it would burst. Can't go wrong with this one.
