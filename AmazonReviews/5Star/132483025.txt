I love this Phase 90. It has all the phase/haze/psychedelia I love in a sound. I was quite impressed with the seller too. The product description was used-like new but when I received it the pedal was in all the original packaging with no scratches or signs of wear and even in the original plastic. Amazon has them decently priced too. Would recommend!
