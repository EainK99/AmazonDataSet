This is the best wireless microphone system I've ever heard or owned. I as a nurse work in a very large skilled nursing facility and enjoy doing activities with my patients. When our microphone system went down the patients were devastated they couldn't play bingo and other games because they simply couldn't hear and it would be weeks before the new system came in. So I brought this system in for us to use and I as well as our patients and co-workers were so amazed by the quality of this system. The sound was so crisp and clear, and loud enough for everyone to hear in a fifteen hundred square foot room! What's nice id's I can adjust the volume to the amount of people our size of the room I'm in. There was no interference, distortion, or drop outs like most systems even at its loudest level. The battery life of the microphones lasts for hours. It is so easy to recharge them, saving hundreds of dollars on batteries and even has an indicator on the system that tells when it is charging and charged so there is no guessing. What I love about the manual is how detailed it is and even has it's own page for troubleshooting issues which I never had to use because I haven't had a single problem yet. I also being a beginner at running the system by myself looked like a professional thanks to the instructions. I don't just use this for work, I used it to speak at my sister's wedding, and am planning on using it for our family reunion this fall. The sound carries and is just as clear outside as inside. I'm truly impressed by the quality and sound from this system! The size us small but sounds just as good as a big system! I received this product at a discounted rate for an unbiased review.
