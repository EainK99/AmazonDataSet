I saw this item and was interested in the fact that it was switched as a desk light along with being a decorative light. When I was given the chance to get one at a discount in exchange for reviewing it, I was quick to buy.<br /><br />So many usb led lights are always on when plugged in. The fact that this one has a switch is a tiny detail that helps so much. I can keep this plugged in but turned off, which makes it very convenient. The fact that it has a use beyond a &#34;party light&#34; also adds value to it.
