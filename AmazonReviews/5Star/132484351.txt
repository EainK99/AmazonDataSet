These are comfortable with good sound.  I bought a very expensive, studio quality pair for my son to use for his music recording, but he likes these for just listening to music on his ipod or laptop.  This is a replacement pair as the ones he had lost the sound in one ear, but then he is very hard on headphones.  These ones are cheap enough for him to abuse and carry in his backpack to school.
