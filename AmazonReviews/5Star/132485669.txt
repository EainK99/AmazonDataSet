I've owned these for several years now and have had no problems. They are extremely durable, fit any size thread, and speed up set up/tear down tremendously. As others have mentioned, it eliminates the inevitable rolling/dancing wing nut issue. I've never had one fly off the stand no matter how hard I hit my cymbals either.<br /><br />The \\"security\\" feature works, but has no use unless you are leaving your kit set up overnight, but let's face it, if they want your cymbals, slick nuts won't stop 'em.<br /><br />They are excellent quality and made to last for years (as mentioned above). I just bought two more for a couple extra stands recently acquired.<br /><br />If needing a smoother, faster set up/tear down, buy these. You will NOT be disappointed. Drum on!
