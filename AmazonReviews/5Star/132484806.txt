I got my uke seven hours ago and have been playing it nonstop. I went straight to my music teacher to get a better understanding of what I was looking at, and he had nothing bad to say. He also said it was very much worth it for the price. I don't have a single complaint for this ukulele. After stretching the strings and tuning, it makes an amateur like me sound good! You have outdone yourself yet again, Songbird!
