This little guy has great tone and plays nicely for such an inexpensive item.  It's great for practice any time of day and is the best option for Tavel in my opinion. You don't have to worry about the high action of the backpackers and it stays in tune well.  I'm glad I bought it and look forward to a lot of good years use from it.
