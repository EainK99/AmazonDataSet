received the tuners, it did take a while =, but the listing made it quite clear that it would take a week to 20 days. they are heavy and feel well made. the only suggestion for those of you who are replacing tuners, i have to drill out the heads stock on the Hohner guitar I am repairing. these tuners are slightly larger (thus much better) than the tuners that were on originally. pretty much why i did not want to spend the money for Grover tuners on an inexpensive guitar..Good quality as far as i have used them.
