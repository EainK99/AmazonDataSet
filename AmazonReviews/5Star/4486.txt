this thing is so versatile. I have a pearl 7 piece kit on a pearl rack with 10 cymbals. I don't own a cymbal stand besides my no leg hi hat (Gibraltar). I got this to connect one end to the no leg hi hat stand and the other to one a cymbal arm to stabilize the hi hat. It can go up Down and all around. 360 degrees of easy adjustments  Plus it extends even longer if you need it to. It's one of the pricier pieces from Gibraltar. But it was totally worth it. Cheers.
