I have been doing gameplay commentaries for about a year and finally took the step to upgrade my mic set-up. The first thing I wanted to do was buy a shock mount for my mic and this was a great choice. I had gone back and forth between this and a couple slightly cheaper options, but I knew this mount would work for my mic (ATR2500 USB) so I went with it. It was easy to attach the mic to it and easy to attach the mount to my stage rocker mic stand.  It keeps the mic stable and right where I want it, which was vital for me to record properly.<br /><br />Just remember if the mount doesn't attach to the stand you have, make sure you unscrew the insert on the piece that attaches to the stand and try it then. I had to do this and it fit perfectly.
