This PA system was a very good purchase. I am a photographer and periodically, I do presentations requiring my own PA system. This one comes with its own wireless mic... a must for doing presentations. The 600 watts of volume is more than enough for most groups of two hundred or so. Also, it has input jacks to allow for a variety of uses. All of this at a price under 200 bucks. I would recommend to my friends and family members.
