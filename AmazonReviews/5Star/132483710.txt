We purchased this for our church to record the sermons. I had to do a number of tests to find the best channels and combinations but after 30 minutes of experimentation the unit works great. We feed the XLR's into a zoom h4n and the sounds is very high quality.<br /><br />We did experience some bleeding over in the beginning and also if the position is not optimal, but if you stay away from metal and room corners this unit works great. Distance is good too.
