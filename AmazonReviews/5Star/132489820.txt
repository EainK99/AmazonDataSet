This is the perfect case for my new Parlor guitar. The first case I ordered for the Simon and Patrick was also supposed to be for a parlor but too big and back she went! For the money, an arch top would have been nice BUT the small size doesn't really require it and it stacks better in the airplane overhead.Interior is well appointed and made in Canada is a plus.
