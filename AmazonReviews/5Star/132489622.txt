My 10 year old son loves Elvis for some reason.  I bought this for him for his birthday, and it was one of his favorite gifts.  He is probably an intermediate violin player, and he is able to read and play all of the songs in this book.  He wishes there was another book with more of Elvis' songs for him to play.
