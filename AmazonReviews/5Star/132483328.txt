I put a lot of time into researching an affordable, 88 key, weighted keyboard. The weight of the keys feel great. The sounds that are preprogrammed are good enough for my needs. The bench seems cheap, however it does the job. The stand wobbles if you press the keys hard, but so far the keyboard hasn't fallen off of it yet. I've had this keyboard for over a month, and I will update this review if I run into any issues.
