Ever since I got my laptop stand I realized it would help me to have a tray , so I will give this item 4.5 star so far, even in my review I will put 5 here are my comments:<br /><br />The good:<br />1. Shipping was awesome, super fast!<br />2. The tray is sturdy, solid. (but dont expect light)<br />3. It actually has a little extension underneath, for a mouse or others<br />  which I liked.<br /><br />What I didnt like that much:<br />- It uses also the system of the multiple plastic knobs with the screw, and those suckers like to get lost!<br /><br />Pls. consider:<br />I gave a high score because I wanted it for my home studio, and I am not moving it around, if you are constantly moving I can see a bit of an extra work and time on assembly and a not precissely feathered-weight item, plus those stupid knobs that roll and... gotta be hunting them.
