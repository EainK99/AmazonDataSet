Amazon recommends this bass for me, but I've already owned one for years.  I've yet to see as much bass in such a teensy cost.  Deep tones, neck-through body, solid hardware, active EMG's, and a low B that doesn't rattle until you want it to, and reasonably good looking to boot.  Will curve your he-man spine.  This is the bass you want, yo.
