I inherited an old acoustic guitar and decided to spend some time regaining some lost skills.  The strings on it felt like knives cutting through my no-longer-calloused fingers, so I gave these a shot.  They were easy to string, easy to tune, and much easier on my fingers, while still delivering a nice sounds across all six strings.  They have also stayed fairly close to in-tune between sessions, only needing a small tweak to get everything back where it belongs.  Definitely recommend.
