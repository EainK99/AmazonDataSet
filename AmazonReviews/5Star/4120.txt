love my shofar.. it came very quick... didnt take long... it was polished  and so pretty.. no bottle of polish in it.. but that is ok.. its so lovely. it has a great sound... im loving learning to play it... it does have a smell as they all do.. but ive put some young living essential oils in it and its smells better.. the actually length  is about 33 inches.. just right... im very pleased with it and would order another one.. thanks oh and it came with a very nice dark blue bag.. fits perfect. very nice..
