The Fuloon 2 in 1 Blinking non-blinking lights work great!  They were very easy to operate and lasted longer than stated! I used them in my balloons latex & mylar!  The only thing to remember is that they will add weight to the balloon, so you need to experiment with how much you inflate the balloon to compensate for the extra weight.  Have fun!
