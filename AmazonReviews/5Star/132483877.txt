VERY happy about this ligature.  My daughter was having the hardest time with the ligature that she was using that came with her clarinet.  I went out on a limb and bought this, as it was more expensive than others.  But it is worth 10 times more than they are charging.  Cheaper than going to the music store for sure.  Works professionally and she now has no more problem.  A+++++++
