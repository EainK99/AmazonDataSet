These pouches are excellent. I recommend getting the mounting &#34;kit&#34; that is in addition to this so that you can mount this wireless holder. Vertical in line with the step so its much better than sitting sideways like most do and more often than not fall off or keep bumping into something. Kinda defeats the purpose of being wireless if you can't have the transmitter out f the way and yet still easy to get to for battery changes.  I love these pouches and the vertical strap additional piece for all my guitars and basses.
