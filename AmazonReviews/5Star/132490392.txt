This stand bag works very well for me. I find it easy to use, plenty rugged for moderately frequent local gigging and does a good job protecting my stands. I save time setting up and tearing down. I was pleasantly surprised at the construction and materials. For the price I expected much less. A couple of my stands protrude a few inches but I put the rubber feet on the \\"flap side\\" and haven't seen any damage to the exposed portions. No rattling, rubbing together and the straps adjust tight enough to ensure nothing falls out. Not my choice for constant road use or airline travel but more than adequate for local travel/light gigging. I live in the Pacific Northwest and keeping my stands dry are a big consideration. This bag does a good job on that, too. My 5 star rating reflects what I consider to be a great bag for the price. Even if using a hard case, at this price I suggest using this bag for it's protective and organizational attributes.
