I purchased the matching head and am very pleased with them. The amp is very loud and the cab sounds really good. I only use this at home and it's more than I need to be honest. But this cab has a good speaker in it. I imagine if you needed this for small gigs you could consider replacing the speaker but for me it's ample and is an excellent mate to the amp. It's very reasonable on the price. I purchased both for around $210 delivered. For someone on a budget like myself it's hard to beat the price. It takes pedals well too.
