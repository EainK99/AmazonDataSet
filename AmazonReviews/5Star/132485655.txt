I have been using Zildjian cymbals for over 30 years , and they are the best .  The sound is perfection .  The splash cymbals are my favorite . I had to finally replace my 10 inch splash , after many years of beating up on it .  I like the Avedis line the most . I highly recommend this size cymbal  .
