These picks are great! My preference size for picks are .60, the Tusq at .68 are a little thicker of course but not that much. What I love most about the Tusq picks is that my guitar has a fuller sound with a lot of clarity while using the picks! I own an Ibanez hollow body guitar, Epiphone Les Paul and Squire Strat, the picks sound great on all three guitars! The Tusq logo raised letters help with gripping the pick. I originally bought these because I love to collect picks and try out different kinds, now I have tried the Tusq picks I will be buying more!
