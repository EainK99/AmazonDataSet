To all the drummers...If you're looking for an inexpensive way to have in ear monitors for purposes of playing to a click (and also for vocal monitoring purposes) these buds are great. When inserted correctly, Isolation is comparable to the roll up foam 32db ear plugs I have been using live for many years to protect my hearing in a VERY LOUD stage volume band. These buds have excellent isolation and make playing to a click live very easy.
