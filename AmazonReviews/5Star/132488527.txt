I have a PRS SE guitar and I love it but I couldn't manage to get an AC/DC like tone from it and my black star amp so I asked the guys at guitar center what they thought and he said try the OCD. I thought well if I don't like it I can take it back so ill take it. I think I can get surprisingly close to the AC/DC tone with this pedal. The knobs work well one for volume which many people already mentioned you can use it as a boost it definitely increase the volume of my amp on the clean channel. The tone knob turns the sound to bright or dirty and the drive sound adjust the distortion I feel that it allows you to dial in just the sound you want for distortion. Also a side note I asked a popular jam play instructor after I brought the pedal...the metal guy...name one pedal that many artist use for there guitar solos? without blinking he said OCD full tone overdrive pedal. (The metal dude is seriously a guitar genius) I said to me that was the final stamp of approval for this pedal. I feel the pedal will continue to be valuable to me.
