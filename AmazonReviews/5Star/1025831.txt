I wanted to learn how to play the drums and this set was the lerfect choice since my wife does not have to be disturbed by any noise. The individual drum heads are easy to adjust and the different kit sound options are great. I am learning basic drum fills right now and need to dive into more of the functions available with this unit. I normally just use my head phones when I play and just added an amp and the sound is great.<br /><br />Very happy with the purchase.
