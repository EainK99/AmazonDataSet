Use this as an XY configuration for overhead drum mics as well as a base to hold my sE Reflection Pro filter for vocals!  It's worth every penny and an essential piece of equipment in my studio. Highly recommended. Everything is adjustable on this, you can remove a piece off of the top beam to make it about 2/3 as long as it looks in the photo.  Weight is easy to adjust as well but doesn't slip around.  There are cable organizer loops all along the stand too that really help with staying organized.
