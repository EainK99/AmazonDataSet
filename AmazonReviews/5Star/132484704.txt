I ran house music through two of these for several hours, put them in two Lopo Line 1X12 cabinets and played a blues and R&B gig.  These sound better than my EV 12-ls, Celestion Vintage 30s and my Eminence 1218s. I use a Strat with a fair amount of gain and the line between harsh and dull can be thin and hard to EQ right but these fit in with my gear nicely so I can take care of everything with the guitar's tone controls. These may be too dark if you are a humbucking guy but are sweet with single coils. A nice solid singing mid range, lots of oomph in the lows with just enough presence and bite in the highs. Tone wise it sounds a lot like a Celestion greenback.
