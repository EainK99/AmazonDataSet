Changing a Martin Right handed 12 String acoustic dreadnought into a 12 String Left handed guitar. I needed fret markers. These worked great. Changes the nut and saddle as well. Took off the pickguard.. Now it's a left handed 12 string. These worked wonderfully They adhere very easily, and stay there. You don't feel them when you play. So they are absolutely great.
