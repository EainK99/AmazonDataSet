WoW!!!!! All i can say is WOW!!!<br /><br />1st of all this thing is so easy to use its not even funny. It sounds so good you would think you’re dreaming. The Nexus program you can download from DigiTech is awesome! They have lots of preprogramed sounds or you can mix and match your own and save them to the RP300. With the onboard direct to computer recording it has no equal. I will still keep the pedals I’m using, however, with this thing I dont think i will ever need them again.  You can save a butt load of money with this and avoid having a huge pedal board because this thing does it all! Thanks DigiTech!  [[ASIN:B00I534TCY DigiTech RP360 Guitar Multi-Effects with USB]]
