This is the best value in a pro tools interface software package . Don't worry about having protools 10or 11 , pro tools mp version 9'has everything you need for a home project song writers studio . Grat quality sound , a ton of plug ins and loops , offers a lot more than any pro tools express package . I've had this for a year now and unless you're running a studio pro tools mp has all the functionality to create great recordings , mixes and masters . I upgraded to 10/11 and for my needs it wasn't really necessary . This is all you need !!! Much better than the new m audio interfaces (which avid has sold to Akai by the way ) .
