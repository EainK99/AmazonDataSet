I was looking for a microfiber cloth to take care of my guitar finishes and wipe them down after playing. I bought a  fine one from Planet Waves, but this is better. It is softer and cleans the piano black gloss on my Takamine very nicely. It simultaneously takes of the oils, dust, and human residue that show up on the instrument while shining up the surface. I need another one for my case.
