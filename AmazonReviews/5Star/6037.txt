I'm not musically inclined. I want to play music when camping. I tried a harmonica and a flute, but they were too hard to learn. I play video games and watch anime, a lot of the music is ocarina and I love it. I researched a lot before I made another mistake buying another nick nack for the shelf. I came to this plastic ocarina by Noble. Sturdy for camping and has a hole for a lanyard, that's a plus. Within the first hour I was playing Zelda's lullaby like a pro. This thing is so easy to learn, no special lip positions or blow pressure, there are so many tutorials on youtube for so many songs that I am familiar with and know how they should sound. I have been grabbing it up at every free moment to practice, I have found a passion for it, which I'm beginning to find is a requirement for learning a musical instrument for me. My kids recognize the tunes and enjoy when I play. I want to thank other reviewers for helping me make an informed decision that I do not regret.
