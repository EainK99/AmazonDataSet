I have been hunting and hunting for a case that would comfortably fit my Jackson Rhoads (js32) guitar that wasn't the hard case, because no one wants to lug that monster back and forth across a large university campus? Plus, I wasn't confident that the hard case would fit in my little car. Anyway, I think my favorite thing about this case, aside the fact that it fits my guitar perfectly, is the addition of the pockets on the front. There's a long pocket good for cables, or whatever else you want to put in, and then the big pocket with the small compartments at the bottom. It's a great case. I love it.
