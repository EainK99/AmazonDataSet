I really have no complaints about the Blue Yeti USB microphone. It did what I needed it to do - and did it well. If I could, I would use it all the time. Unfortunately, the demands of my voice-over work required a different setup...however, if you are just looking for a COOL USB mic - this one will NOT disappoint!
