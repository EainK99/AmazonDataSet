The oak wood stand is nicely constructed.  The shaft of the stand is well turned and the book plate is seamlessly held together; there are no glue marks or visible screws.  The finish is smooth without drip marks from the coating.  It was simple to assemble the stand and it sits solidly on the floor without wobbling.  There are three recessed screws at the bottom rear of the bookplate and no other visible metal objects on the stand.  The oak color of the wood was lighter than I had expected but I have come to enjoy the stand just as it is.
