Boy, I'm surprised at all of these bad reviews.  Mine works like a charm.  It sounds great and it's LOUD if I want to crank it up.  I use it on my patio for parties and I lug it up to the deck when I go or a swim in the pool (it's pretty heavy, you know, like a rock).  I don't have to worry about a splash here and there.<br /><br />So when it is working properly -- and mine has always worked properly -- here's the scoop.<br /><br />Batty power: very good.  After I charge it, I don't have to worry about it for many, many uses.  granted I don't run it for 4 or five hours at a time.  Usually 2 hours or so while we swim.  But honestly, I think I charged it once or twice this whole summer (it's August right now).  I'm quite pleased with it.<br /><br />Connectivity:  I've connected several devices to this rock (one at a time, of course) over the summer.  I've never had a problem that wasn't just me screwing it up.  I hit the power button, it cranks up (with a too loud tone), I hit Bluetooth on my device, it scans, it finds, I select, it pairs, it plays.  Really, it's been great.<br /><br />I think it powers down if it's not playing anything for a while or it looses the connection.  I'm not sure.  Not helpful, I know, but I think it does that.<br /><br />Appearance:  You won't fool anyone into thinking this is a real rock (unless you hit them in the back of the head with it).<br /><br />Durability:  It's solid as a rock.  Really.<br /><br />Sound quality: Absolutely adequate for casual listening as well as parties.  No distortion at high volume.<br /><br />I have not purchased a second one, so I haven't paired two.  But I might.  The thing is one is working fine for me.<br /><br />I don't give 5 starts to everything, but if something does what it's supposed to do and does it will, I see no reason not to.<br /><br />The only caveat is that you need to remember you're buying a rock.  It's heavy.  It is meant to sit on the ground and stay there.  If bare toe meets rock, rock wins.  As a result, I am looking into a smaller Bluetooth speaker for the deck because I am getting tired of lugging it up to the deck.  Nonetheless, this rock is louder than the ones I'm looking at, so for a party in a large yard or other large area, this rock will be the go to device.<br /><br />Also, be advised, you cannot leave it exposed to heavy rain; you want to put it under something if you think you will just leave it outside 24/7.  Otherwise you will have to take it inside during bad weather.  I leave it outside for days at a time, but if there's rain in the forecast, it comes in.  I don't consider this worthy of a star reduction.  If you want waterproof, get waterproof.wins.
