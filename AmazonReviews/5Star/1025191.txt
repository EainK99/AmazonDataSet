My mom purchased this in black a little over a year ago, and both my brother and I split the payment when paying her back. So, now it's our snowball. This is the most cutest mic I've ever used, and first time ever owning one. I haven't used it much, but my mom and brothers certainly have. The quality of this mic is phenomenal, and there's 3 different switches in the back to cater to your particular environment. I tend to keep it at the 1st level, since it's mainly used for voice overs or doing tutorials.<br /><br />By owning this for a little over a year, the quality is as if we just brought it. I like how it's compact and can be used with any device that has usb compatibilities. I just plug it into my Macbook Pro and I'm all set to record. The sound is amazing! I can even pick up the NYC noise from police sirens, or people yelling from my window. When I say it can pick up everything, I do mean everything, possibly even hear a pin drop. One day I plan on purchasing a colored one, still deciding on the blue or pink one. For the price we got it for it was well worth it and affordable. If you really want to get this, definitely wait until the price is reasonable for your pockets, as the prices fluctuates from day to day, so keep a close eye out for it.
