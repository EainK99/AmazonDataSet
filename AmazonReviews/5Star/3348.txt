Wow I really like the djembe.  Its my first one.  I have been a percussionist for a while and was looking for just a different sound than my congas'.  The sound is rich and I really appreciate the &#34;legal wood&#34; assurance.  The sound is rich and Im glad that the tightening directions came with it.  I was born in Germany so I was drawn to the company.  I will buy from them again.
