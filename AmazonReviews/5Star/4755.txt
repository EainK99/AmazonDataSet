I'm experimenting with mouthpieces. Depending on if I'm playing in jazz ensemble or a concert band, I normally use a yahama 14a4a for jazz and either a conn 4 or 5c megatone for concert. I was looking for something I can use for both. A friend suggested I try a 3c.  I found this mouthpiece and for the price I would give it a shot. I like the megatone because the extra weight seems to give me a fuller sound. I played on it last night at practice and was impressed with the feel and tone quality. After practice I tried a &#34;real&#34; megatone 3c that the director has and couldn't tell the difference between the two. I'll see after a while how the finish holds up, but... so far so good. It showed up two days after ordering it.. I'm pleased with the product and speed of service. I've had dealings with the seller of this item and I only have good things to say about them. Thank you...
