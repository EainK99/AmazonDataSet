From the multimedia environment I come from, the choice was always going to be the Blue series line of microphones. Typically the Yeti or Yeti Pro were the hardware choices I was surrounded with, but for my own personal consumer projects I found it hard to justify those particular purchases. Sure, they are better quality, but that doesn't make the Snowball bad by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />Using the Snowball for local recording and broadcasting via voice chat applications has been perfect. From a high end gaming headset with mic in the absolute best of conditions, it still compares not in the least to the Blue in merely okay conditions. The cardioid setting is perfect for those in a somewhat noisy environment.<br /><br />If you're considering a great consumer level microphone to give you the best of your expectations when gaming, podcasting, recording your chat, or more, then this is an easy purchase. Especially if you have an Amazon Prime account, there's no difficult deciding. While I may have been hesitant at first on whether or not to pick this up or spend the extra on the Yeti, my choice has not let me down.
