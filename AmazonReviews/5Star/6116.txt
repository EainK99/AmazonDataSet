I went to Guitar Center and tried this one. I am still dreaming and don't want to wash my hands as I told him. This guitar made me feel in heaven. All the sounds you can get are just amazing. I played it using a PA Bose system. The sound and quality are impressive. I like it very clean but at the same time I would like to try it with some effects. The price was quite high almost 3200, custom. I was so close to get it but other obligations made me to think about it. So, it will be my present for this Christmas, for sure. If you are looking for a good guitar with everything in it this one is the best by far. Hundred stars...!!!!
