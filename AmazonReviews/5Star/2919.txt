I just received my Hohner Rocket harmonica yesterday in the mail.  It is quickly becoming my favorite harmonica to take with me whenever I travel.  The harmonica in its zippered case easily fits into my pocket.  That's why I call it my Pocket Rocket.  If you want a great harmonica to go with you and sound great, this is the best way to have both.
