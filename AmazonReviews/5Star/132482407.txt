I Like this instrument. It is solidly built and attractive. I have a Gibson Earl Scruggs (Mastertone) banjo and it sounds just as good but not quite as loud.<br /><br />The tuning pegs are behind the transparent Banjo Head. I think it looks cool. It is a little difficult to tune due to the reduced size of the instrument but not significantly so. There is no place to attach a clip or tuner. This is no problem for me. I use a Snark Metronome/ Tuner and place it on the music stand, table, chair, etc.<br /><br />The part I like the best about this banjo is it is small but comfortable to play. I take it to work to practice during break.<br /><br />Considering the size, sound quality and playability of this instrument I have given it five stars.<br /><br />I would very much recommend this Banjo to people who have trouble finding time to practice. Just take it and play wherever you are.
