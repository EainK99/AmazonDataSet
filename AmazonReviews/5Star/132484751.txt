Pioneer must have been going for a set of speakers that can be detailed but also perform very strongly to give an immersive experience for the dj/producer/songwriter. If that was their goal they nailed it.<br /><br />Yeah the treble is strong... but so is everything else. The mids, and bass take their stand along side their slightly taller brother mr. highs. The bass is slightly emphasized and done very potently, eliminating any need for a subwoofer even in large rooms.<br /><br />Details are above average.<br /><br />Very clear sounding and warm.<br /><br />Compared to the Yamaha hsm 80's these would be the more immersive experience while not far off in detail-hsm80's being the more neutral yet also the more dry sounding. Pick the ham 80's if you just want to analyze music and thats it. Pick these if you want to be able to analyze the music(not nit pick) enjoy the music, and hear the instruments bite.<br /><br />A common warning for monitors is to be aware of ones that color the sound instead of giving you an accurate representation of what is on the mix. You really need to learn your equipment more so and not just use one thing to mix. You need to learn where its dry so you dont oversaturate it and vice versa. You need to learn where the bass is emphasized or lean so you dont over-under compensate.<br />The perfect audio piece is super expensive.<br /><br />For someone who needs to feel the music and wants dependable equipment this needs to be on their short list.<br /><br />Forget the cellphone issues and stuff mentioned before. I had some sound issues with noise when I first bought them but after these beasts warmed up and got comfortable they relaxed and any issue with noise is absolutely gone.<br /><br />One downside is resale value. They are not that popular despite their name. This is an example of a marketing failure in my opinion. So it would be hard to sell something that a lot of people don't really know about. Aside the fact that they would have pay toship something that weighs 67lbs  you would have to sell them cheap for someone to bite while considering the shipping.<br /><br />THe build quality is as to be expected. Pioneer is very dependable and despite their marketing failure these babies shore didn't fail in the build. I have had them for a while and everything is still like NEW.
