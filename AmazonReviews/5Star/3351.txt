OVERALL: Great headphones with faithful sound reproduction. Cannot imagine there's a better value out there - was surprised to find that these industry standard phones are under $100. I 100% recommend these.<br /><br />I run sound at church and needed headphones that will faithfully reproduce the signal. An audio pro who does both studio and live work gave a clinic for our sound team and recommended these.<br /><br />I cannot be happier.<br /><br />Affordable, comfortable, perfect amount of noise cancelling, exceptional sound reproduction - what's not to love?<br /><br />I'm also a drummer and these work great for reducing the db assault on my ears during practice. I hook them up to my iPhone to listen to the click or songs I'm trying to learn. Everything sounds great. While the db from the drums is reduced it's not muffled in a way that interferes with practice. For example, I still know if my rim click sounds right or is slightly off.<br /><br />I love that the 1/4 adapter screws on and off so it won't accidentally get left behind when I pack up or switch jacks.<br /><br />The cord does not seem like it will tangle easily and I have not had any issues yet of it kinking up and don't anticipate that to be a problem.<br /><br />The 1/8 inch plug housing can interfere with connecting it to a phone depending on the case you have so you may have to modify your case (enlarge the hole that goes to your headphone jack), take the case off, or what I do is carry an extension cable.<br /><br />I do recommend buying a case for them.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone regretting buying these especially for under $100.
