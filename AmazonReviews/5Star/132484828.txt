This product arrived as advertised with all of the advertised adaptors which is very nice.  It is well made but for my intended purpose of mounting my Sennheiser MKE600 mic on my video camera, it might require some adjustment.  The mic is just a bit smaller diameter than needed to fit tight in the suspension of this product.  I have put an extra two twists in the horizontal bands on each end and that helps hold the mic from slipping.  I will do the same with the vertical bands and that should do the trick well enough.  For a slightly \\"fatter\\" mic, this would be ideal as delivered.  I also really like that it is adjustable for the horizontal angle of the mic.  Even though I need to make a few adjustments, I will still rate this product as excellent.
