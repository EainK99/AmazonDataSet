Cassette to CD and MP3 is a program on a CD with a cable.  I connected the cable to the back of my old computer in the \\"microphone\\" port.  The CD installed and between the CD and the booklet the process to copy noise from my old Sony Walkman (the tape) to MP3 took place.  This product works.  It is going to get a real workout as I have almost 50 tapes to make MP3.  Thank you Digitope. Without you all my information, music and interviews would be lost forever.
