The louder the better, I'll turn in my grave! Seriously though this a great pick. I was expecting it to be thicker than it was, it is about as thick as any pick I just assumed by the picture that it might be thicker. Sounds great, loving the tone I get out of my picking now. Works great with acoustics and electrics.<br /><br />Heads up though, you only get one so you might want to find another vendor you might give you more with your purchase.
