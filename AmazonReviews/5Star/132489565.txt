I have been playing and collecting guitars for over 25 years, and the Guild D55 is without a doubt finest dreadnought I've ever owned. The D55 I have is a 1994 sunburst model made in Westerly, RI, prior to the Fender buyout of Guild. The tone of this instrument is incredibly full and balanced. I also own a 2006 Guild F50 that was built in Tacoma, WA. While the F50 is louder and bassier than the D55, it lacks the balanced mids and treble that enable the D55 to really cut through the mix when played with other instruments. I have previously owned a Taylor 414CE Koa, a Gibson Songwriter Deluxe, and a Gibson J45 Custom. While each of these guitars is well built and beautiful in its own right, none has the rich, mellow tone of the Guild D55.
