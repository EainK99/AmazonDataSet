I bought this use for live performances, along with a laptop and some other controllers. It's compact and works well in a live setting. I had no problems getting it to work with both Live and Reason, pretty much plugs and plays. The keys feel light but that's to be expected in this price range. The pads feel and work good. The knobs work for me, but have an incremental clicking that might bother some, not me though. It fits in my backpack with my laptop and everything else, very portable.
