Definitely worth the money for a starter 8 string guitar...it feels natural and has a 27&#34; scale neck with the jumbo fret combo makes playing it easier I'm not one for picking special pickups but they'd probably help its already good sound overall in my opinion it's worth the buy comfortable affordable and the seller is very good about customer service as well
