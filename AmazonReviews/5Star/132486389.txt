This instrument stand was more expensive than some of the others that I was considering, but I wanted to make sure that I was going to have a stand that would neither collapse nor topple over during use.  This item is very sturdy and securely holds my daughter's flute during marching band practice.  It folds up and comes with a cloth storage bag to make it easy to carry along with all her other items for band.<br />I would highly recommend this item.  It was well-worth the money.
