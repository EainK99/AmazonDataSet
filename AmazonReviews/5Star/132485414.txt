the shock mount is made of sturdy metal, the pop filter is made with two layers of cloth with an air space between them.  The filter support telescopes, you can adjust the length and the angle on each end.  All the parts are metal so you can crank down hard on the knobs and not break anything.  The elastic is stiff enough there is not much sag in any mounting direction.  The microphone attaches to a captive treaded ring nut.  The whole thing mounts with either standard American microphone stand threads or the smaller European type threads.  I tried kicking the stand with the microphone live and yes it reduces the noise greatly but of course not 100%.  I thought the price was a little to high but when you consider you get a quality pop filer that is a no-brainer to mount and adjust and remains \\"put in place\\" the price is reasonable.<br /><br />This is NOT a general propose generic shock mount.  It is designed for only a few Rode model microphones with threads on the bottom that fit the threaded ring nut.
