I'll make this short and sweet for those who are looking at inhibiting the low frequency travel of their subwoofer in a more apartment-like setting.<br /><br />I've done a lot of testing with this and the Vizio S4251w-B4 5.1 sound bar in my 2nd level apartment and I'm very happy with it. I have people above and below so I have been pretty worried about being able to watch movies with any amount of volume but that has changed with this product.<br /><br />I am able to watch movies with lots of sub usage at 3 and a half dots (this makes sense if you won the sound bar) and it may not sound like much but I'm in an apartment, so it's awesome. Basically it's 1/3 of the sound bars potential (probably a little less) but it sounds amazing in a small living room and you still feel rich sub in every scene. In working with the people that live around me, the people downstairs said it's not a problem at all even when I had it higher and it felt like it was exploding my living room! So, that's pretty much fantastic right? Sort-of.<br /><br />The only caveat to this is that it didn't help as much with the people upstairs. The problem is the poor construction of the apartments and the way low frequency sound travels but as of right now it's using my little fireplace as a means to travel up into their apartment (the walls as well but it shakes their fireplace the most). I can still use 3 1/2 dots but if I max that 4th dot they are unhappy. If you can, get your sub away from walls, and furniture enough so that it doesn't use them quite so effectively to send the low frequencies into the building.<br /><br />Overall. Great product. Drastically reduces how much of the sub is felt in the space below mine just not as much in the space above (may seem obvious but I just wanted to point that out for those in a similar situation). 5 star!
