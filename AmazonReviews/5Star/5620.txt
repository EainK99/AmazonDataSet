This is a great addition to any DJ booth or party.  If you compare it to the cheap Halloween strobe lights, this as a strobe light alone is far more versatile since you can change the color AND speed (not to mention the fact that it can be a color fade light, and a pulse-to-the-beat light too).  I've had one of those cheapo's actually begin to melt on me after a few hours of constant use, and this stays cool since it has it's own built in fan, but that also means it's not 100% quiet.  It's not loud enough to be heard over music, but can easily be identified in a quiet room.  I received it at a deep discount to review, but to be honest I wouldn't hesitate to buy it at full price as a party or halloween effect light.  You'll probably need to keep the directions!
