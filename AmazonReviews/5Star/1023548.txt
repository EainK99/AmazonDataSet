I am rating for value here.<br />Pros: For the price this amp is a beast. I have had for at least 7 years now. I used it for gigs and it survived. All-tube, except for the reverb, It took a new set of tubes well. Fendery cleans. Heavy saturation on demand on the overdrive channels.<br />Cons: The handle is a little weak, it comes apart over time. No foot-switchable channel. EQ is limited. Ideal for home practice, backup amp, or studio.
