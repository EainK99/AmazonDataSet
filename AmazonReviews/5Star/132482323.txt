I got this to replace the total POS 1x10 cab that came with my vox lil' night train head. I love this cabinet! It's well built and possibly the smallest 1x12 out there? Plus there's a panel to run it open back.The price is nice too. Love the front grill and blue color. Wish I had another one. It sounds a little boxy/midrangy with the lil' night train head but not in a bad way at all. It really sings and feeds-back nicely.
