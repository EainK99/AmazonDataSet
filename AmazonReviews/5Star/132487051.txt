As a broadcast professional, I was a bit skeptical of the reviews for the ATH M30's.  Under $60 for \\"professional studio monitor\\" headphones is a bit hard to believe.  I do know.  The sturdy construction was the main reason I went ahead with the purchase and that part of the review was obvious from the moment I busted open the package.  The heavy cord, stout head strap were obvious as well as no apparently weak points which are too often a feature of headphones in my experience.  That was nice, but then when I put them on, I was shocked. The depth, separation, clarity..all outstanding.  And I could still hear myself talk when using them with a mic, which can be a problem with some audiophile-type equipment.  And, like many of the audiophile types who have reviewed previously, they just continued sounding better since, as I've probably given them close to a hundred hours.  Van Morrison's Moondance never sounded better.  Only quibble is that on some recordings that weren't as clean, the ATH-M30s make it way too obvious.  My downloaded  Miles Davis set has an annoying hiss that I'm pretty sure wasn't in the original.  Never noticed it playing through the crummy little speakers in my Kindle Fire (not HD.)  Wholehearted endorsement.<br /><br />Update:  a few months on, love them even more.  Tough as a boot.  Have been subjected horrendous feedback, loud play, rough treatment and still booming, even improving in sound response.  Hearing stuff on old fav's I never picked up on..caracas that are almost too loud on a couple of Rod Stewart cuts from the 70s, e.g....thinking of getting a second pair for home.
