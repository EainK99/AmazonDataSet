These drum sticks are a nice weight and feel good in your hand. The coating has a smooth finish to it and no worries about it splintering like some unfinished sticks. The ribbed bottom helps get a good grip over flat sticks, especially for smaller hands. Really nice. The natural wood/honey color is nice looking too.
