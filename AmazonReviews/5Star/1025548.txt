This thing made me a superstar!!! I sing in pitch... I can't sing.  I have no musical talents. I cannot play a guitar. With the TC-Helicon Harmony-G XT. It's more than what I read and saw on youtube.com. I can connect a CD player to instrument input and it will turn on the Harmony and pitch correction circuits. I use Guitar music that I recorded with the Tascam DR-05 that I bought at Amazon. I have used a Keyboard and it works!!!! FYI don't use a phone or MP3 player, too much feed back. It's worth every penny. Update the Firmware, it will be OK!!!! The Harmony voices there are great!!! TC-Helicon Harmony-G XT Your the Man!!!!
