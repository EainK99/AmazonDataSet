I've been using this stuff since I was in high school. I am 37 now, and I still use it.<br />I miss the metal can. Yeah that's how long I have been using it.<br />It used to be better quality, the quality has went down over the years, the stick used to be more of a rope cotton fiber, and stronger. The cloth that comes with it used to be stronger, and more ridged, and the can used to be made of metal.<br />It's a lot cheaper now, but still gets the ob done, and I still use it daily.<br />So from an old school user, who has been using it more than 20+ years. This is good stuff. If you use it right.
