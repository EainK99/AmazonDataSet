I have two single Hercules stands and now this double. I am not at all comfortable putting one of my babies in anything less secure. This double one has acouple of important features. For one thing, when you lift out one guitar you don't have to worry about it tipping over or rocking the other one left in the stand. It is solid and stable. The price for that it has a wide footprint. Too bad.<br /><br />These are very well made. Yeah they are more expensive. I don't store my guitars in cases because i play them all the time. My stuff is worth it and I think these will last forever. I figured out that every scratch and ding on my guitars came from improperly putting them away. (leaning them on furniture or leaving a cord plugged in is a classic lazy mistake).
