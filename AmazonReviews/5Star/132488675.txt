Put this in the neck position of my Indonesia made Squier Vintage Modified Telecaster Special. The guitar came with a Duncan Designed JM-101N single-coil that had an &#34;okay&#34; sound.  Reusing the original pickup cover was a simple matter of removing some hot glue that held the pickup in the cover.  After inserting the SJM-2 in the cover, a little new hot glue was all that was needed to fix the new pickup in position.  The holes in the cover matched the new pickup perfectly.  I reused the foam/spring pad, screwed it down and soldered the two connections to the selector switch and back of the volume pot.  Nice, fuller sound with more output. Guitar is strung with Regular Heavy Super Bullets.  I am waiting for a Seymour Duncan Quarter Pound for Tele STL-3 Lead (Bridge) Pickup to come in the mail to replace the stock TE-101B single-coil bridge pickup.  If you have this guitar, buy these pickups.  The product arrived from the seller ahead of the scheduled delivery date.
