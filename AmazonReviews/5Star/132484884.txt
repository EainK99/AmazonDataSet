I've used about four different audio interfaces over the last 5 years, and this thing is by far the best.<br /><br />I'm extremely happy so far.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- Low latency on my mac.  First time I've been able to software monitor (with effects!) and not notice much of a delay.  (I use Ableton).  This opens up brand new possibilities for live performance.  This is why I'm so happy.  (And there is always direct monitor if your machine is not keeping up).<br /><br />- Solid midi support.  With the very low latency, again, opens up new live performance possibilities.<br /><br />- Driver.  Along with the hardware, the quality of the OS driver is extremely important.  The performance of the Mac driver is amazing.  My macbook air 13\\" just flies with this thing.  I can run the buffer settings very low without any drops or glitches.  No hangs or crashes.<br />- Solid build.  Metal case.  Made in USA.<br />- Preamps.  My recordings are sounding great under a variety of conditions.  Decent headroom, super low noise, good sound.<br />- Documentation.  They invested in a decent manual.<br />- Intuitive controls.  Of course the half-rack form factor makes for cramped front panel, but they did a wonderful job fitting an intuitive interface into that small space.  Once I learned it, I can remember it because it just makes sense.<br />- Lots of channels for the price and quality.  4 in, 4 out, plus 2x2 digital.  I can plug my old EMU USB 0404 into this thing via the SPDIF digital inputs, and add another two quality XLR preamps, and be recording 6 channels simultaneously.  Drool.  So I'm using my old audio interface, which no longer was supported and thus wouldn't work on newer OSs (win 7 and OS X lion), to get another 2 channels of great analog input.<br />- Price.  Really, for the quality of the drivers, the rugged hardware build, and the number of channels, it is a screaming deal.<br />- Lots of independent mixes.  Want a four channel headphone amp so everyone in the band can have their own mix?  Included!<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- No major complaints so far.<br />- The half rack form factor makes for a cramped control panel and rear inputs, but I quickly learned the controls.<br /><br />The people at MOTU are doing an amazing job.  I'm blown away so far.  If I have any issues I will update this review.
