We purchased two of these. Wonderful as there is no glue odor if you are sensitive to such things. I find that it is a problem with most cases for most instrument...the stench from the materials used to make it. These do not have it. The case itself is great. It has a space for 4 bows. A zippered entry as well as a locking latch, plenty of storage with two compartments on the inside, and one zippered on the outside. Seems very sturdy and it comes in a variety of interior colors. We have a red and a blue, and they are both lovely.<br /><br />Great case!
