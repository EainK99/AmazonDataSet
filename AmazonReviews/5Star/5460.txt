Saved me from buying another mixer!  I had my Xenyx mixer fail and just simply &#34;go dead&#34; when I pulled it out at a gig.  I managed to get through the night without it, but I was dreading the thought of having to invest in a whole new mixer.  I researched online and saw multiple suggestions to try replacing the external power supply, and for under a 20 spot, it seemed worth the risk.  Got the replacement and it was OEM, which is great, and sure enough it fired my mixer right up and saved me roughly $80 in the process!  Don't be afraid to invest in one of these, and I actually may pick up a spare to have as a cheap insurance policy in case my mixer goes south on me at a gig again!!
