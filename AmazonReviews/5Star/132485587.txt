Love this mute.  Works well, and I can lift it slightly while on the bridge to change it's effectiveness....push down, mute is working, lift up slightly, mute is off or not working.  The metal mutes which slide on your strings behind the bridge were chewing up my strings and this mute was the best solution since it does no damage to the strings.  I have had more positive comments from other violin musicians about this mute also.  The price is right also.
