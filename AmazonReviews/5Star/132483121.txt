These phones have the flattest frequency response of any I have tried that sell for $100 or less. They are plenty sensitive (loud). Bass is solid, deep into the 20's.    They are light and comfortable. Cord-scrape noise is almost nil.  Cord attachment to the phones has very good strain-relief. There is ample cord to loop over the ears, if that's your preference.    There are only two improvements I can think of:    1. Fit them with replaceable chords that are cheap and readily available. (Or maybe this will be the first model in history with cords that can survive my abuse.)    2. Give them away for free.      Edit: I am upgrading from 4 stars to 5. The chord is really tough. Thin and quiet, but tough.
