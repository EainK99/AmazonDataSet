I bought this microphone and headset receiver for use in a bible meeting where everyone takes part.  One person was hard of hearing and couldn't hear much of what was being said so missed quite a bit of the meeting.  However, upon plugging headphones into the receiver and using the volume control roller switch on top, every word was comprehended.  The others just passed the mic one to the next and everything worked smoothly.  There is a good battery life also for both pieces.  The quality seems good and has a good feel in the hand.  Overall - a good purchase!
