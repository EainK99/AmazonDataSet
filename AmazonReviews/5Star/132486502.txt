After looking at countless power supplies on the market, I ended up choosing the Fuel Tank Classic because of the number of isolated outlets, plus the 12V DC & AC outlets. It is very rugged and has enough juice to power my entire board. The supply also comes with a variety of connectors. It really is rock solid.
