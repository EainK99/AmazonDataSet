I'd like to rate this a 4.5 but since I can't I'll round up.  I have the Vintage Tobacco Fade, not the Antique Violin Satin that is shown here.  It's clearly a very well made instrument.  The detail work is quite nice, including but not limited to binding and inlays etc.  The tone is very nice however it's not as loud as my low end Morgan Monroe that I'm upgrading from.  That's the only problem I have with it.  It plays beautifully and the intonation in nearly perfect.  I ordered through Michael Kelly which was the nicest experience ever.  They even sent me pictures of 3 instruments to choose from and it came pretty well set up.  I hope that a little age will bring out some more volume and sustain but otherwise I really love this mandolin.  Thank you Michael Kelly.
