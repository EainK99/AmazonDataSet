Sam Ash must be the only place that sells this particular case.  I actually got mine in the store.  I've been searching the web for other reviews and I never did find this at another site.  At any rate, I was looking for something different than a hard case but I wanted something sturdier than one of those thin nylon gig bags. I never get technical in my reviews, so the best I can say is that this bag seems to offer a good amount of cushion and protection, that's the most important aspect.  As an added bonus it looks stylish (if that matters to you.)  I am an adult and wanted something a little more mature looking than some of the other bags I've looked at. This looks similar to the bass bag which I read someone on another site complain about not being able to open the top pocket with the bag upright without something falling out. If you keep that in mind then you shouldn't have a problem.  There is also a pocket in the front for a small laptop or notebook, thus saving me the struggle of carrying a separate laptop bag to lessons. I haven't had the bag long and so far I've had no issues.
