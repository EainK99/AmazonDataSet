This little speaker might seem small and deceiving at first, I was a little worried. But, it worked great for a wedding ceremony. It is really loud and we had it at less than 1/2 power for a guest count of 150 at an outdoor wedding.<br /><br />The mics are decent as well and we had zero problems with them. The instructions aren't clear on how to charge the unit bu you have to have it plugged in and in the on position for it to charge.
