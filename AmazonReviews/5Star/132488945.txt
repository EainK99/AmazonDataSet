A digital multi-effects pedal I owned really soured my taste for digital sounding effects. To me analog effects pedals have always sounded the best. Until I gave this baby a shot. A salesman at a G.C. store recommended it after I had tried a Memory Man and a Carbon Copy and couldn't decide which one to get. These pedals all have a great analog sound that I like but that is it. They ONLY sound analog. After trying the FlashBack I realized that some delay sounds can only be reproduced digitally. The FlahBack has such a nice selection of 11 different types of delays. If you can't find a delay tone you like on this pedal you never will. If you play classic rock like me you will hit many of the classic tones used in songs with this pedal. If you like the sound of U2 the 2290 mode hits it perfectly. The subdivision selector with .4, .8, .8+4 is a great added touch. Also the audio tap works very well. Some people have said they prefer a foot tap switch to achieve tap tempo. But I find strumming on your guitar a very natural way to sync the tempo. And the Toneprint feature is icing on the cake. I tried several Toneprints that sounded great. This feature will keep your pedal fresh with new tones for years to come. I have not tried the looper yet but hope to soon. My recommendation always is to try this pedal along with others before you make a decision. But if you can't do that and can only order on-line do yourself a favor and get this one. It is very, very versatile with the most features of any delay pedal for the money! I am Soooooooooo glad I tried this pedal.
