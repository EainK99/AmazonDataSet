This was purchased for medium quality guitars and works great for that.  Wasn't expecting superb, high quality pieces. They work just fine for the medium to lower quality guitars and most people wouldn't know anything about the quality so no matter, anyway. I'd recommend these to anyone who isn't fussy about perfection in their guitar.
