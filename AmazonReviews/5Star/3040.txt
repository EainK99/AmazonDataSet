First off, let me say that the 5 star rating is not because this is the best controller you can buy. It is because of the combinations of features you get with this controller plus price that you are paying. The value you are getting here simply cannot be beat!<br /><br />The number one complain I'm seeing here is that the controller come with Serato DJ Intro. That should not be a complaint because this is not intended to be a fully professional setup. If that is what you are interested in, you should look to spend $1000+ on a controller that comes bundled with the $200 piece of software. Numark is not Serato and they simply cannot sell you a $250 controller that includes software that costs $200 (by itself) for free.<br /><br />With that said, lets explore some of the PROs and CONs of this controller, keeping in mind the price range.<br /><br />PROs:<br />- 10mm pitch slider. This is invaluable if you are a mixing DJ. You are able to make very small inputs and accurately manipulate the tempo of you track. No controller at this price range offers that.<br />- The platter is very sturdy and all metal. Its the same that is found on the Numark NV which sells for around $700.<br />- Highly responsive MPC style buttons are great for looping, samples and cue points. The best I've seen on a controller at this price range. Tho they are a bit smaller, I haven't found this to be an inconvenience.<br />- Independent low/hi pass filter nobs on each channel. Again, something that is typically found on higher end controllers.<br />- Sliding track search / FX manipulator. This is a Pro and a Con for me. I like the sliding track search, again, a more high-end type of feature, however, I would prefer if the FX had nobs for manipulation.<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br />- The only real Con here is the lack of gain control for each channel. It seems odd that Numark would leave this out since its such a basic feature. They managed to add a boat load of high end features at this price pointbut left out something any DJ but the absolutely newest would recognize a shortfall. This can be compensated for but requires too much effort for such an easy thing to include (IMHO).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />With that all said and done, you will be hard-pressed to find a better controller at this price point. it you are coming from vinyl, like myself, this is a great way to skip CDs and go straight to software manipulation. I the only reason I would buy a more expensive controller is for the gain knobs and that would be for professional use. I believe that most of the advanced features found in more expensive controllers are &#34;gimmicky&#34; at best. 90% of them you would never use in a professional setting. They are just here to entertain us DJ's as no one on the dance floor care how many buttons your controller or CDJs have.
