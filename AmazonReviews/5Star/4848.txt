As I get older, I've been paying more attention to my body position when playing my guitars. Like most amateurs I play mostly while sitting down, in a chair or on a stool. After studying what worked best I realized that having one leg lifted provided better support for the guitar, better access for my hands, and a more stable position for my body. I searched for a low cost portable stool and saw the good reviews on this model. After several months of daily use it has become a necessity rather than an accessory. I now feel unbalanced if I sit and play without it. I liked it so much that I bought one for a friend. This is a simple item that can make a big difference in your playing comfort and quality.
