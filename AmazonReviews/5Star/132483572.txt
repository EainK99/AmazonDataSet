I have two of these humidifiers, and they work great. I actually use them in my tenor ukuleles. Because the uke body is much thinner than a guitar, I filed two notches on the plastic collar and slip them between the strings so that it hangs down into the uke, but is parallel to the body. Don't know if that makes sense, but it works very well, and has calmed down some unwanted wood movement in my solid wood ukulele. I have to add water about once a week, but that is no big deal at all.
