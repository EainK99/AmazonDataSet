I bought this for my neighbor as a peacekeeping gift for his subwoofer. Not wanting to be the bad neighbor, I bought this explaining that it'll help stop my apartment from vibrating while making his subwoofer sound better. Now I only hear the slightest of sub noise measured at +5db over the background noise of my apartment, as opposed to the +15-20db gain I'd get when he was using his subwoofer before. No more shaking of my apartment, and worth every penny even though I'm technically not the one using it.
