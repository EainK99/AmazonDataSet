Ordered this for my daughter to take to college.  We read many many reviews of products and chose this one.  Excellent product for the price! It has so many cool features, and a keyboard just big enough for her needs. Fits in her tiny dorm room, and the headphones are great so her roommate can study while she plays.  The stand works perfectly thanks to our reading the reviews and putting it together correctly.  Would highly reccommend this!
