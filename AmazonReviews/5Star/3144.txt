I've used many brushes because I've been playing jazz since 1978. So I've tried many some which really are awful. The is the only one for me. I have a pair of Vic's while handle brushes too and don't like them. These are perfect and can be played pretty loud if you lay into the drum, or a whisper. Runs the entire spectrum of the brush palette. They're not paying me to say this.
