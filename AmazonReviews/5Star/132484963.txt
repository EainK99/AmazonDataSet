Love the length of the cord, love the color scheme, love the portability and carrying case, and I find the audio pleasant and very deep. It has a locking mechanism within the headphone port on the headphones themselves so yanking is unpleasant but doesn't damage the headphones themselves. Fantastic Pair of Headphones! Oh, but it does get hot, but it's not unpleasant for me. It's just the body heat collecting in the ear cup due to a good seal.
