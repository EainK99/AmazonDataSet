I do not right this comment to make anyone feel bad. My hope is to make you feel better.<br /><br />I can clearly understand how upset one would be buying a drum kit and realizing that it is not complete, as shown in pic. From what I gather from the title line, they are clear as to what you get, or do NOT get ! Unless it says \\"complete\\" with cymbals, pedals, stands, and misc.  hardware ( do come that way too ) , you are buying just a shell pack. That leaves the purchase of accessories up to you. That will work in your favor, I promise. The price is also a clue to what you get. Same exact set,  from same seller. One price is $249 the other $399 ?  Something is up, right ?<br /><br />I am guilty too often and leap before I look, but anyone at Amazon or on the internet would be happy to explain this. Today, I find that people do not want to communicate. I am a seller and beg people to contact me.  The title line and description on these drums makes complete sense to me, but I have been playing for 57 years.  I DO understand in these times, buying shampoo can be a struggle !  LOL<br /><br />Before you spend your money,,,,,communicate with the seller, and/or do some research. If a total stranger were to ask me, I would be happy to toss in my 2 cents , as to what to expect with your purchase. But,,,,don't bash the drum maker, or the seller. In 99.999% of all items I look at, they are correct. Besides that, Amazon wants their customers happy.<br /><br />Drums this cheap aremost likely made in China, they will do fine with better heads when you wear out the originals ( think of it like car tires ) , and the hardware will be fine for home use, not tearing down and setting up daily. I sure wish I had a shot at a drum kit at these prices when I was 5 years old.  ANd bottom line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I believe with all my heart that you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Either you , or your young ones, get past it and practice, practice, practice. What a beautiful art form.
