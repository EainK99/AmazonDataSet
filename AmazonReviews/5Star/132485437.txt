Upon receipt of this stand, I was a little worried that it might be too small to adequately support my cello.  However, I tried it and it works like a dream.  It gets the job done and is quite  sturdy.  Also, it has rubber over the metal at all points of contact with the instrument so it does not scratch or mar the finish, and this rubber also &#34;grabs&#34; the cello to prevent it from sliding around. Best of all, it was cheaper than all the other stands I looked at.  Bravo!
