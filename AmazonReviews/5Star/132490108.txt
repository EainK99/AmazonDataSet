I bought this bag to consolidate some other stuff i had floating around. Until recently, I was using a standard speaker stand bag which fit 2 standard speaker stands and a mic stand. In addition to this I normally have a third stand for a monitor, 2 Chauvet Colorstrips and a lighting stand. ALL OF THIS FITS INSIDE THIS ONE BAG! Transporting all of this is easy and it doesn't weigh as much as you would think.
