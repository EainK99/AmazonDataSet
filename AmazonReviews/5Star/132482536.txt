My 3 year old loves this..perfect gift for playing silly music...cant really complain...but I do have to say I dont think everyone gets the same extras...I saw a review where they recieved an extra string which I did not unfortunately...the product details do not state that you will recieve one but if someone else got one then id like one to..just saying...the details also do not state the other things in the actual picture of the item for sale as extras...so they should be edited out of the picture...because I wouldve liked to have recieved ALL of it... but the guitar is cute little and very fun for my daughter....her favorite part is the pitch pipe..hahaha
