A perfect microphone for my use.  It follows your voice like a mother, giving birth to her offspring, which is good, clear, warm sound.  Also, it is very good at not picking up background noise, even though, somehow, when it detects your voice, it picks up everything.  I wouldn't want to be without this one any more.  I have used it for home recording, but, it is hard to keep it out of the hands of local studio professionals that I know.  And, obviously, it has been used to record some of the greatest stars in music.  The adjustments on the back were crucial to having it perform the way I wanted, so take note of them.  Highly recommended to everyone.
