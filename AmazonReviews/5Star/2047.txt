Great beginners mandolin, I play guitar and wanted to get out of a creative rut and learn something new. I was originally looking at the cheapest mandolin available (won't mention any names) and based on recommendations from players on mandolin blog and chat sites decided to go one level up. Boy am I glad I did because I found this beauty. I found the fit and finish on this mandolin outstanding with no blemishes. The Tabaco sunburst is subdued compared to a standard sunburst, I like that. It only needed a quick tuning and intonation setup and it was ready to play. A real bonus is its amp and recording ready. The picture shows what appears to be a standard single coil magnetic pickup but mine came with a under saddle piezio pickup and it sounds great amped. Make no mistake, this is an entry level mandolin but that is exactly what I wanted as I wasn't sure if I would continue to play it for the long term. Now I'm sure I will continue to play this mandolin frequently and hopefully for a very long time.
