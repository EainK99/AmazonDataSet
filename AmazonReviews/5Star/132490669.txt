My grandpa, who has never owed a “new” instrument and was wanting to get back to playing a mandolin, was presented with this little puppy right here as a birthday gift.  He thought it was a very expensive mandolin but when I told him how much I paid he began to pick the prettiest little tune you ever did hear on this thing.  Probably not performance quality but for sittin’ and pickn’ you’d never know the difference.  A great little starter, and a great little gettn’ back in’r.  A great deal and Grandpa’s (foot) stomp of approval!
