I play B-3 over in-ears. Without a good bass response, I can't hear the first drawbar. The dual-transducer set-up in these is great. At first I was pretty disappointed in the frequency range, but I just didn't have a good seal. The product comes with several different sizes and styles of in-ear tips. You have to find the one that gives you the best seal. For me, it was the triple-flange tips. Once I got those, I began to love this product. I have a comfortable and stable seal, and the sound is amazing. Worth the money.
