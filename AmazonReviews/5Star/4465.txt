These headphones are AWESOME. I use them for gaming, netflix, music, and just normal tutorial watching and such. I really enjoyed these headphones but there are some mini flaws like when I wear them, it makes a HUGE ring around my ears and a huge bump in my head but hey, that's around the ear headphones!
