First off,I ordered my guitar on Monday and received it on Tuesday. This guitar looks and sounds fantastic. The craftsmanship is superb and the sound is clean( no buzzing ). I couldn't find any deal better at the local guitar dealer. I highly recommend this to anyone on a budget or a beginner.  Was thankful for all the insightful reviews on here and the YouTube reviews. You cannot go wrong with this purchase. Another thing is the packaging. They really put effort in packing this thing with styrofoam and filling empty spaces in the box with cardboard to avoid damage.
