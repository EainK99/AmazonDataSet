I love these strings!!  I used to play .13s on my Martin.  Since I play electric guitar on a regular basis, I wanted strings that didn't sound too thin if I went with a smaller gauge.  These .10 strings are bright and full and coated.  Love it!  Now I can play electric guitar and then grab my acoustic and keep the same playing style.  I used Martin medium bronze coated for the last 15 years.  These are way better and are now my new standard!<br /><br />Don't forget to set up your guitar for a lighter gauge. I think .10s sound better with a Solid Top Spruce with Rosewood back and sides.  Rosewood is a warmer wood tone so these strings match up very well.  I also put these on my Solid Spruce Top with Mahogany back and sides and it was slightly too tinny for my taste.  It wasn't the D'Addario  coated brand, it was the size.  Next time, I'll go .11 or .12, same brand name and style!<br /><br />Get these strings,  they are way better than Elixirs (poly or nano) by far!  They sound better and last longer. Don't forget to wipe your guitar strings down after you play.  Strings will last longer!
