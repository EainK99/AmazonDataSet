This is exactly what i was looking for. A nice long and sturdy shelf that i could store a large device, like my  barracuda mail archiver on to without needing a rack drawer set up. It feels very sturdy after being mounted. I feel like i could literally hang from it (not recommened). I don't feel as if my device or the shelf is going anywhere. Definitely feels safe and secure.
