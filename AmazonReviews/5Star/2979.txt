I've collected a few tuners over the years, and this has got to be one of my favorites, probably tied with the Snark.  The lights are extremely bright and easy to read.  The tuner is very sensitive, very little pressure on the tuning machines moved the bar.  I  tried the tuner out on a tenor banjo and electric guitar, they both tuned up fine.  The tuning matched my Snark too, so I'd say it's spot on.  What I really liked about this tuner was the clip.  The whole unit can swivel for easy viewing, and then swivel out of the way.<br /><br />This tuner is really well designed, works well and seems well built.
