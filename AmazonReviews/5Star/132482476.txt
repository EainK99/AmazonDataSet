This has taken over as my main guitar stand, that's how impressed I am with this product. Materials seem to be of high quality and the rubber bumper seems to be attached well. It's light, but sturdy; it's low-profile, but I never worry about my guitar falling off the stand. The pick holders on the top are just the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Awesome product!
