This is a great little uke!  It stays in tune after a week or so of tuning it daily witch is normal.  The tuner that comes with it is fairly cheap and two have failed me at this point.  Austin Bizaar was kind enough to send a replacement but it failed as well.  At this point I really don't need a tuner as I use my phone to tune it.  I highly recommend!
