Very Hip Retro light effect! Diggin the intensity and clarity of the images produced. It may not as some have said be for Professional use, but I would slightly disagree in the fact it is one of many lighting effects a pro would use in their arsenal. If you play the right genre this light would be an epic retro addition to the score. I have many light features and this one certainly has its place amongst them. Total recommend for those looking for that cool beat reactive pattern to impress the crowd either for a leisurely gathering, party or even a professional splash of ingenuity.
