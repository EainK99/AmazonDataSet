I'm a beginner and have been trying to teach myself for the past year. Before buying Rock Prodigy, I would try to find lessons on youtube for beginners and start from there. However, this did NOT work for me. There was a lot of scattered information out there and it was very difficult to know where to start and continue building up my guitar skills. These lessons are simple, fun, and easy to follow! It's such a great way to learn and much faster than I would have done anything on my own!
