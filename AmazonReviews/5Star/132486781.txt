I'm not an expert when it comes to audiophile products, and am always taking reviews where people use highly qualitative and vague terms to describe some \\"improvement\\" in their sound stage when using various products with a grain of salt, as they're usually highly subjective and often not substantiated with any sort of testing results. Blame the research engineer in me.<br /><br />However, I will say this: this Sovtek Tube has definitely brought life to my Bellari VP130 phone preamp. I have heard sounds where I've heard none before. Strings seem that much more rich and warm, and it sounds like a string should, with reverberation and oscillation. The bass has dropped in intensity compared to the stock tube (I lost the \\"punch\\"), however it is so much cleaner, focused, and I bought the bass levels back in the amplifier equalizer.<br /><br />The tube took some time to \\"break in...\\" I could tell an audible difference immediately, however, it was probably about after a day of staying warm that I started hearing things in a new context.<br /><br />I have no experience with other remanufactured or NOS tubes, so all I have is this context. However, I can highly recommend this tube to anyone looking to improve preamp sound quality at a great price. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
