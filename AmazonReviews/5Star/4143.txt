I bought this for my teenage daughter to listen to some music that is mostly awful.  She loves it.  The sound is great, and the fact that I can hook it up to computer speakers or our surround sound or her boom box is a huge plus.<br />I don't know much about turntables, and I can see from the vast array of options and prices that I could research them to my heart's content.  Since I don't have time for that and you probably don't either, I'll just vouch for this one.  Set up is super easy, and I plan to purchase one for myself so I don't have to go into the teenager's room to borrow hers all the time.
