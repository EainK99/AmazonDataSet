This item is much better that I was expecting (payed just $1.70 for it - took about 1 month to deliver, but was no hurry for me). Using it as mood-improving night light - just right brightness for this purpose. There are no controls, just plug it into regular lamp (better looking up, so you will see nice rotating lights on ceiling - attaching a photo of this picture...).
