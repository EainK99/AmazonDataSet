i have purchased about 10 whistles in the last month or so, looking for a quality instrument.  Of all the whistles i purchased, including an expensive pro model, the Clarke is the standout winner for the money.  Don't be fooled by the Clarke's low price, this whistle has consistent performance in both octaves.  if you are a beginner, you have to learn breath control, before you can judge this whistle.  Check out youtube and you will see the experts playing mostly inexpensive whistles.
