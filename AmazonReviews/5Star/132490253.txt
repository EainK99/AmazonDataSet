This stand is sturdy, and requires no assembly, it's ready for use the moment you receive it, just fold it out.<br />I have two, one for rehearsals and jobs, the other for my home studio. The foam will not stain nitro finishes.<br />It features adjustable neck slots which also have pick holders on them. I've tried the others, I like this one.<br />David Carpenter
