I ordered removable casters, hoping they would match a '79 Bassman 10 I had recently acquired. The casters arrived in a couple of days and included the male and female parts. I didn't even need the receivers because the casters fit perfectly into those on the bottom of the amp. I pulled them out of the package and snapped them in place in about twenty seconds. I love 'em, especially for this 70 lb. old tube amp. They were just like the casters on the Bassman I had in 1978.
