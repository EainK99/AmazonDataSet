Loved this little Ocarina.  A little on the cheap side?  Sure.  But you're getting a great iconic trinket from the Zelda series without spending a pretty penny and it works well as both a Halloween costume/cosplay piece for an adult, or as a toy for a child.<br />It looks pretty good and feels very solid, like it would be difficult to break.  It's made with very strong plastic.<br />It does play like a real Ocarina would and all of the Zelda tunes are playable if you're willing to take the time to feel them out (plus it comes with instructions on how to play a few of them).  As people said, it does sound more like a recorder flute than an Ocarina but hey, if you're in it for playing the real instrument, you might wanna get a real one, so no complaints from me there.<br />If you're really picky, there are whiter areas in the paint around the holes where the plastic sealed together but it does not detract from it in my opinion and if it did, a simple coat of paint would fix it no time.  I thought it was fine as is.  Pretty true to the picture.<br />I recommend this item!
