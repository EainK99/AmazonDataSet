I bought this guitar as a backup for my Godin Multiac Duet. I play fingerstyle professionally. It's the best acoustic/electric I've ever owned. It's great for jazz/fingerstyle/classical gigs. If you're a classical player trying to get used to a thinner neck or a jazz player trying to get used to a wider neck, you can't beat this one. It's incredible acoustically.<br /><br />The battery holder is a little weird. The battery just sits on the contact springs without anything snapping it into place. Just a plastic cover that go's around it. So check that out when you play the guitar. It has not been a problem at all so far.<br /><br />Make sure you play it first. For some reason the higher end Cordoba's are very different from one to the next. Ironically their lowest model C5's are spot on. I played one of those for a couple of years. I've never played a bad one.
