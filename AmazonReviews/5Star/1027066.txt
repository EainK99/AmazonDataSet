This is one bad ass mic. My sound quality went way up on my podcasts, voice overs and video. Works great with my Zoom H6 recorder. I connect the XLR cable from this mic to the Zoom H6 recorder, line-out to my Canon Vixia G30 camcorder for great video podcasting or video interviews. For audio podcasting, this mic to my Zoom H6 recorder & Mac. I can get up close to the grill and not have any pop. The built-in filters work great for eliminating any breath pop noise and background noise. I will purchase another Shure SM58 when budget is available. This review is for the Shure SM58, but i can't help talking about the Zoom H6 recorder in conjunction with this mic. The Zoom H6 also has nice mic modules, great for capturing ambient sounds while recording voice or instruments with the Shure SM58 mic. I also plan to use this mic with my Zoom when doing videos with live bands. I can connect up to 6 Shure mics to the Zoom H6 for instruments and vocals. The best mic for my needs, period...
