If I could I would give this pair of headphones a 4.6 out of 5 stars. Basically everything about them is awesome except for one thing. First I'll tell you the good things about them. Personally I like how they are over ear. I also think they look good, although they are huge. They fit nicely and are very comfortable. It's awesome how they include a pair of velour ear-pads as well. They sound almost perfect in my opinion. The bass is a bit loose, probably due to the 50mm drivers, but there is a good level of bass. The mids are clear. The highs are pretty forward and can be a little harsh on some songs. That said, the staging is great, it feels like your sitting in the middle of a recording studio. If you want to listen to these with a phone, they will do the trick even if you do have to turn up the volume to the max.  Also, these headphones are even better if you get a headphone amp. I just bought a cheap Fiio E6 amp and now they sound amazing.  To sum it up, these headphones are totally worth $40 (actually they're probably worth $100), even if they wouldn't be the best for monitoring.
