I got this item very quickly and was overjoyed with it the pictures don't do it justice! its a beautiful instrument everything works great i'm going to dabble with it for a bit but when i get Rocksmith 2014 i will be jamming with this thing 24/7 ! This is a great gift idea for someone interested in guitar! looks like it costs a whole lot more than what you paid for! get it you wont regret it!
