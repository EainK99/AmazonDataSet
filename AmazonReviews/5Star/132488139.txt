I purchased the ATR2500 USB Microphone for use with my Samsung Chromebook for radio show call-ins and podcasting. I was a little nervous about the price and how that would relate to quality, but once I had everything setup I was blown away.<br /><br />I would suggest getting a pop filter for the microphone to cut down on air from your mouth being picked up. The headphone jack is great and has a volume adjuster built in.<br /><br />I purchased a scissor arm, pop filter, and shock mount and setup a nice little studio in my closet at home. I am really happy with my purchase and would recommend this for anyone looking for a high quality microphone at an entry level price.
