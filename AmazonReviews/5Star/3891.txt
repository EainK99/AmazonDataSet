Works perfectly on my 6 string ibanez sr756 bass! It came earlier than expected, very tiny and easy to place, exremely accurate and blew me away. My guitarist loved it, he felt like it was the best tiner hes ever used as well. Might have him sold on getting it too. Great product, would buy again if i ever needed too.
