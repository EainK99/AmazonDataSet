I don't know eher the variation comes from in some of the reviews, but the Steinberger that I got is made in South Korea, not China. The action and setup were spot-on out of the box. The neck is wonderful. I have been playing guitar for about 40 years, and tend to prefer Stratocasters, Teles, and BC Rich. The neck on this guitar is different from a Fender neck, but only in the shape and the fact that I like my Fender guitars (with the exception of one Tele) with maple fingerboards. The same can be said in comparison with BC Rich - Maybe a bit thicker profile that the Mockingbird and a rosewood (not REAL ebony) like a BCR. But, notice I said different NOT worse. Finishing of the frets along the edge of the fingerboard is perfect. All frets are nicely finished on top and are medium-jumbo size.<br /><br />The tremelo system is fine. It stays in tune and is easy to maintain. The body shape feels just plain wierd, but the size is what makes it what it is - travel friendly. My only complaints are that the controls are quite close together, making it difficult to roll the volume knob while playing and not bumping the 5-way switch. (Note that I have only had this model a few weeks and may get used to that evetually.) And, the pickups (although IMHO better than pervious Steinberger EMG select pickups) are not ideal. But they are also not too bad - the neck pickup has excellent tone! Not too bad of Strat sounds from the neck, mid and the 2 and 4 settings of the switch.<br /><br />Note that this guitar has excellent sustain - I was really impressed.<br /><br />My stand on this guitar is that you cannot do better for $400 and a travel guitar. In fact, there are not many $400 dollar guitars in any class that will beat this handily. I will probably do with this Steinie what I did with my other one - spend a few dollars on some Duncan pickups and then it will really be NICE!
