Works flawlessly with Linux, plug and play, no drivers needed.  Just set the jack connections to whatever input you want.  It shows up as a Keystation 49.  I'm using Xubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu Mate 16.04.<br /><br />It also detects the polarity of a foot pedal when turned on.  If your pedal polarity is reversed, plug in the pedal, turn the keyboard off and on to reset the polarity.  If you press the pedal when the keyboard is turning on, likewise, the polarity will be reversed.  (This info wasn't in the manual)<br /><br />The only possibly issue:  You might not like how the action of the keys feel.  :-)<br /><br />Edited to add:  I notice the description on the item was recently changed from &#34;synth-action&#34; to &#34;semi-weighted&#34;  This is probably more accurate.  I bought this expecting synth action.  Also, I did  test out the 88-key version in a local music store, and was surprised that the springs felt 2-3 times stiffer than the 49 key version.  This might cause confusion, as I would have thought the 49, 61, and 88 versions were basically the same type of keyboard, with only a different number of keys.<br /><br />If you like semi-weighted action, this will be a non-issue.<br /><br />Otherwise, the key action may feel really strange at first.  This was my first semi-weighted keyboard I've used.  When you play this keyboard, the resistance increases the further a key is pressed.  Imagine pressing on a stretched rubber band.  There is no inertia on the keys, nor is it an effortless smooth press.  Typically I'm used to piano (which has more inertia/resistance up front) or a synth with little or no resistance (maybe with a little &#34;click&#34; at the bottom of the press).  Anything in-between can feel really strange.  Otherwise, after playing on it for a few weeks I'm mostly used to the action and no longer feels as weird.<br /><br />The smaller 49 key version is light and portable, and a great basic interface for a vsti or sequencer.  IOW, I think of it more as a midi input device than a performance device.<br /><br />A minor issue, the manual for the device was 90% non-English, and some pages were printed in the wrong order.
