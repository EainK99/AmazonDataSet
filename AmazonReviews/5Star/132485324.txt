This MM is fantastic. I'm a classical pianist and teacher so the MM is often going for hours every day in my studio. The size of this MM is comparable to the large wooden MMs that can cost up to $100, so the price is right. The clicking is louder than any other MM I've owned - my advanced students and I can hear it easily over our playing. My younger students LOVE that you can see all the gears inside. We all like the color, it makes using the MM fun (as fun as practicing with a MM can be...). I'm very happy with this product.
