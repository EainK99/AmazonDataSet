A way excellent device. Tunes tight and close. You always know what pitch  the string is sounding.  I have an older style one where you have to sit real close to the mic  and watch the needle bounce back and forth around the center tone. You never know exactly what it's tuned to. With this you always know.<br /><br />By the way ----  this says it's  a ukulele tuner but it also tunes guitars.
