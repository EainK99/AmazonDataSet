I have a 2 Yaesu 897d's and they have 2 meters (my call is KZ4ZZZ) I bought another rig and it was a<br />another multi-band 2 meter plus radio. Any how they all had the MH-59A8J included so I thought I would<br />buy a extra.... I now have 5 (2 never used ) and they all work 100+...some been dropped...and they keep<br />on ticking.... they contol the radio great, and I have no problems on how I sound. see me on QST.com<br />hear me on 7.185 ssb eve. Hearing is believing.<br />  Allen
