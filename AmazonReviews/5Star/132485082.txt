Very well made. nice weight, perfect size. The only thing i'm not crazy about is two dead sounding strings that i have to get replaced. the other 4 strings are bright n great sounding, but not these 2, for whatever reason. Overall tho, a good deal, and a very good guitar yes.  Update: I took this guitar into Guitar Center to get better strings put on it.The guys that work there said it's a solid spruce top/not plywood.They said it was well made and has a nice body.Its also not made in china for a change.Its my fav. guitar to play. Comfortable and you can hear the great sound/tone n reverberation from the solid spruce top.The guys said it will just get better sounding with age.Awesome quality. !
