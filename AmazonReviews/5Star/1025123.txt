I'm not as well-articulated as some of the other reviewers, and they've already said it all far better than I could have. I just wanted to add my 5-Stars on this product as well. Absolutely phenomenal sound and comfort. I honestly don't believe you could get better headphones for the price and they even beat quite a few more expensive models out there. Definitely not a shred of buyer's remorse.
