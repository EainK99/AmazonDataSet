This quality of this player is great considering how inexpensive it is. It works great plugged into the wall or on batteries if you want to listen to a few records on the go. It's lightweight and stylish.  The tone arm is actually lighter than other non adjustable tone arms i've seen which means your records are being damaged by playing them on this. Only real complaint is that the volume does not go loud enough, which is understandable considering the size of the player. The sleek look is aesthetically pleasing and overall the product is very nice; there are three settings for record speeds which is considerate when taking into account some people still have 78's they want to play. you can change the sound quality by adjusting a few nobs on the bottom which is amazing on a portable player.  Overall a great buy.
