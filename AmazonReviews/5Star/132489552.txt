I bought this stand for my wife to use with her Yamaha YPG-235 keyboard.  The stand is nice looking, easy to assemble, and fits this keyboard perfectly.  The stand is very sturdy and looks great with the keyboard.  Our only gripe is we wish the stand was offered in a darker color to match our other furnishings.  Highly recommended.
