These headphones are perfect for those who work in professional video. They cancel enough noise to use in the field and are built like a tank. They are also ideal for editing because of their flat response giving you the most accurate mix for monitoring. Unlike other \\"over-ear\\" headphones these actually cover the whole ear, making it comfortable to use for hours. My friend who gave them to me as a birthday present swears by them and has had his own pair for 7 years.
