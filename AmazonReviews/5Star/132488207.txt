I changed the stock pots on my AXL Badwater SRO to the Dimarzio CTS pots sold here on Amazon. Unfortunately, the knobs for the old pots wouldn't fit on the new ones. I decided to change the knobs and the switch tip to a black color instead of trying to match the relic'd look of the original knobs. It turned out perfectly!<br /><br />I see some other reviewers saying to brace the back of the pots before putting these on. I didn't follow this advice. I just wiggled them on the top of the post until the grooves got started, then gently applied pressure until the knob was down to the level I wanted. No blown pots here.
