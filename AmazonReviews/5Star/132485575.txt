These are very nice, high quality headphones, and a great deal for the price. I scouted around on head-fi.org for about a month before finally settling on these 'phones, and man am I glad I did. Most of the forums I read compared these to the Audio-Technica ATH M50, which is around $150 dollars. I personally think the sound on these blows the M50's out of the water. They are very accurate sounding headphones, with a surprisingly large soundstage for medium sized cans. After about 60hrs. of burn in time, the sound is incredible! the mids and highs are clear and undistorted, even at rather high volumes, adn the bass presence is perfect for classical music. I've enjoyed every genre I've listened to with these, but I have to say that I think classical sounded the best. When compared to the M50's mentioned earlier, the M50's beat them out for bass, the type you would hear in hip-hop/rap tracks, but everywhere else the SRH750dj beats them out no problem. Definitely the best choice in terms of sound quality for the money I've ever made. On a different not, the break in process for these headphones sucks. It took about two weeks, and for those two weeks I couldn't listen to them for even an hour without them hurting my head. the problem is the headband, there isn't much curve in it when they sit on your head, so they press really hard into your head, and it takes a good bit of getting used to, but man, once you do, they are absolutely incredible! Don't let the break in process deter you in any way, the sound makes up for 100% of the discomfort you go through. In closing, they are worth every cent of $120 dollars. In fact, I would still buy them again if they were $150 or more. Don't hesitate, they are absolutely amazing. Oh, and no, I don't work for Thundersales. :)they really are this good. for more info on them, go to [...]
