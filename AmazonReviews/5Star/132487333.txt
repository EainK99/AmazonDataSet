I am very pleased with this gig bag.  I bought it because I needed something very lightweight and portable, yet protective,  that I could fit in a suitcase along with all my clothes.  It is very well padded and sturdy, and it's honestly higher quality than I expected, given the price.  And it does fit in my midsized suitcase nicely.  I've only had it a month or so, but it looks like it will stand the test of time for years.  I love the roomy pouch on the side -- big enough for several mutes.  Though if you need something that can carry sheet music, this is not the bag for you as the side pouch is not wide enough.  I also like that it can fit my cornet, which is shorter and stockier than trumpets are.  I love the padding over the zipper and the padded wooden insert that fits below the bell.  Great gig bag and would recommend to anyone.
