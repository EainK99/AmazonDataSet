i am now 11. I go this when I turned 5!!!! as you can see it has taken me FOREVER to finally get to writing a review. this keyboard is so cool with all sorts of fun and funny sounds! you can play a beat, plug it into the boom box, and have your own little concert with this awesome keyboard! it is still in GREAT shape ever since I got it in 2005! very durable! I still play with it a lot. it brings back memories  :-)
