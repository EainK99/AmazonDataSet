Through the years buying Behringer gear you come to expect outstanding sonics for low cost and this little box doesn't disappoint. The sound is typically Behringer- a little cool, a little bright in the highs, but with a perfectly silent background and everything well-defined and in balance. I'm using this to listen to lossless music files from my PC in the bedroom. Its at the end of a powered 30-ft USB cable/repeater with it worked with immediately. I have not used the headphone amp.
