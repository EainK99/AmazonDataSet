Wow! After installing this into a Gibson SG in the bridge position its awesome. While I'm not into the extreme metal<br />genres, this pickup is not just for metal fans of the extreme. Its for ayone that wants a kick @$$ metal tone. It totally kicks at thrashy distortion! Whoa! Nice and tight no muddiness nice! As the other reviewers say it cleans very well. Between the Duncan JB and this pickup they are both awesome and all I have to say is Seymour Duncan has made a fine product. Good job!<br /><br />By the way I'm almost 44 years old and not into the drop tune Black Metal genres(like some of it though) and I have to say this pickup is just for any metal really. Love the tightness. I love this witht he Digitech metal master with the Digitech RP1000 effects so nice.
