I bought this piano for my boyfriend who's a piano student doing his master's degree. This piano as all Yamaha has really good piano sounds and although the volume is not very high it is a wonderful piano for practice and learning. my boyfriend was very pleased. Finally, the price is the best!!! you cannot find another piano with this quality for such a price (except Casio, which is becoming better every year but is still not a Yamaha!).<br />Also, the stand is great, looks very nice, is an off white that looks great! I definitely recommend!!
