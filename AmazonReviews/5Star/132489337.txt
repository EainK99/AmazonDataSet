Because tube amps create a 135 harmonic overtone, hey sound warm, and pleasing. Resistors on the other hand create a 145 overtone which is not so pleasing. Thus the difference. That is why i sing and play out of my tube amp. the overtones are harmonically pleasing. I just run everything thrugh a small mixing board first.
