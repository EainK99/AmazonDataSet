This case was purchased a while ago from Amazon:<br /><br />Although designed specifically for 4\\" x 14\\" snare drums, it fits a newer Pearl 3.5\\" x 14\\" Free Floating Snare, with room left to stick in an extra drum head if desired. I put in some bubble wrap to keep the snare from moving due to free space.<br /><br />Drums that use a bottom hoop with large \\"snare strainer gates\\" may not fit depending on how much they protrude.<br /><br />The inside is sufficiently padded and the case is pretty rigid. As usual, they have indentations on the top and bottom to facilitate stacking. I have another SKB case holding a 10\\" snare on top and the lid hasn't sunken in yet. :-)<br /><br />If you have a metal snare drum inside, I would recommend tossing in one of those silica gel packets to prevent moisture build up inside your case.
