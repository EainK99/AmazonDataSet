Great quality! Fits perfect! That's the case. As for as the traktor program &#34;software&#34; goes..Awesome! It has a strange fill but once you really get down & dirty with this controller(ipad4+traktorZ1).. The NI traktor controller Pros outway it's cons. It's cons are just minor & easy to work around live. The case is great, clean, love it!
