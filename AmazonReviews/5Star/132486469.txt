I needed something to keep my guitar and bass up off the ground and off the stands that apply pressure to the necks so I bought a set of these and was very impressed with them. The arms open to fit most any instrument and as you hang the arms fold down causing a tighter grip to make sure that if bumped they will not just slide off and fall.
