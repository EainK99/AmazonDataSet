for the money, this is an excellent value! this is the first electric I have personally owned, and mine came undamaged and almost ready to play. the guitar seems to be well made, the color and finish looks nice. the sound is pretty good. that 20 amp  is more than enough for just playin around. the stand is good enough to hold the guitar, mine came with two extra sets of strings, derlin picks (I tend to favor the heavier derlin ones myself). the case carries the guitar well, it just doesn't have any padding. really the only bad thing in this kit is the tuner, it's kind of a joke if you ask me. if you want to try a strat with out the strat price, this is a very good option.
