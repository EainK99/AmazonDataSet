These lights are great. If you are looking to start  or expand a light show these cans should be part of your rig. whether your a pro or average Joe these lights will help make your show.<br /><br />Specifications:<br />Weight: 2.75lbs (1.26kgs)  Fuse: 1amp<br />LEDs: 86 total (29 red, 29 green, 28 blue)  Supply Voltage 120V/230V<br />Size: 6.5''(L) x 7.75''(W) x 6'' (H)  Duty Cycle: None<br />DMX Channels: 4  Colors: Multiple Colors<br /><br />I was amazed at the light output for such a small can. They are wash lights, not pin-spot. So your show will be filled with whatever color you choose. I would recommend getting  2 or more to even out the light and enjoy the master/slave function. These lights have a few color settings. They can be solid Red, Blue , Green or White ( all though the White has a slight light Blue tint to it)  Also, you can play with the DMX switches to get purple, teal, yellow, orange,etc. Obviously a DMX light controller would make this easier; but its not needed if you just want to plug and play. I ordered a few DMX cables to make a master/slave unit. This makes it convenient to only have to play with one lights dip switches to get the same effect on all of them.<br /><br />I only have two issues with them. The sound mode seems too sensitive. It seemed to pick up high, as well as, low frequencies. You can talk near them and they will change color. In addition, It would have been nice to have a dial for the sensitivity. However, the lights still look great bouncing along to music, just not the beat. Please do not let that deter you from getting your hands on one of theses beauties. Aside form that, these lights are amazing. Amazon was the cheapest price I found. I looked elsewhere online, as well as, at Brick and Mortar stores. They range from $75-120, so for $60, I think they are a great deal.<br /><br />P.S. The manual is somewhat vague, yet straight forward. I read it over multiple  times to access the master/slave function. After a look online  I realized that one page paper manual failed to mention you need to have**** BOTH CHANNEL 1*** AND*** 10 IN THE ON POSITION*** to create a slave light.ne  I realized that one page paper manual failed to mention you need to have**** BOTH CHANNEL 1*** AND*** 10 IN THE ON POSITION*** to create a slave light.
