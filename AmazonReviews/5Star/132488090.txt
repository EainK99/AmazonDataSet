WOW!!!  I just received my new Peterson StroboPlus HD and if first impressions are any indications I am very impressed with the unit.  It really feels to be a quality product I should hopefully get years of service out of.  I don't normally write a review on a product but thought I would add my two cents worth on this product.<br /><br />I did not realize that the nice tuner box had a magnetic closure.  Thank goodness I realized how to open it before I wrecked it by cutting it.  I am surprised Peterson did not mark the box or have some kind of a removable instructions.  The box is really nice and has a lot of protection for the tuner.
