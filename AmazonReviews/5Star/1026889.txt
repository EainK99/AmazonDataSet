I was quite surprised about this product. I connected it a Sony V1U's HDMI output. On the other end, I used the Lenkeng LKV368 SDI HD-SDI 3G-SDI to HDMI connected to a Samsung Plama TV. The whole purpose of my test is to check for latency. Luckily this device only shows a very minimal amount of delay that is not very obvious to the naked eye. I intend to use this device for a huge Zumba studio which currently use an HD-SDI security camera fed to two 60&#34; LCD Monitors via a composite BNC cable. Latency was so bad.<br /><br />But with that said, their camera was not designed with capturing and displaying it on bigger screens simultaneously. So I purchased this device and the Lenking LKV368 SDI HD-SDI 3G-SDI to HDMI and tested it using a professional video camera. The result was amazing. I am still waiting for the two 50ft SDI Cables to arrive and will test this same set-up but with the longer SDI cables. After that final result, I plan to rent A Canon XA20 and see how it will work with this set-up.<br /><br />Will update for my final findings soon.
