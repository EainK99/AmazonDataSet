Light. Folds small. Holds an electric or mid-depth acoustic guitar. A dreadnought will technically fit, but I am not sure I would trust myself to carefully place the guitar such that it would balance time after time. Great for smaller stringed instruments. Happy with it, I put an Ovation mid-depth acoustic or electric guitar on it.
