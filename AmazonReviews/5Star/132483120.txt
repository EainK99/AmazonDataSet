These 12mil single ply heads are amazing.  The sound and response of a single ply with the durability of a double ply head.  I like the clears because I like seeing the inside of my all walnut shells and they are a little brighter than the coated version.  Put one of these on the batter side of a tom and a genera resonant on the resonant side and a quality drum will just sing!
