I bought the Sunburst model. It is worth it.<br /><br />The guitar came in great condition with minor flaws, shipped all the way over to Hawaii and to my front door in 3 days from ordering- long before the estimated ship date (without any express shipping). It is adult sized and came wrapped up safe, opening it up was like Christmas. Will have to sand down the bridge to make it more playable, the strings are up rather high. I'd replace the strings too, but thats just me.<br /><br />The presentation value of this model is stunning. I love the warm colors, it looks gorgeous. Sounds as good as it looks.
