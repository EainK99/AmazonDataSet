Perfect pricing with quality that exceeds other higher end microphones. I played my saxophone into this and it sounded impressively clear when I sat a few feet away.<br />If you're starting out in voice over work this is a great starting place especially if you couple this with a cheap pop filter.<br />However if you can, get the Blue Yeti.
