I owned this model Pyle-Pro PED02 set for three years now. I play them often and have only one complaint and not sure if the mild problem is due to the amplifier type I had used or if I was playing them too hard and over loaded the processor or circuit. But when it happens and it's rare but there's a complete shutdown and a very loud buzz/ hissing from the amplifiers and if I turn off the switch, the system resets and I'm good to go.   The amplifiers I've been using are: 1) the two amps I first used was a Fender Frontman 25 and the other amp a VOX15. each amp plugs into the drum set.     they sound nice but the deeper solid bass nor the high end thrash of cymbals just isn't there. 2) then next, I used adapters so the plugs could hook to a Kenwood model VR-517. It's a five speaker + one subwoofer (5.1) home surround         system/ receiver and I like to use the &#34;Disco&#34; sound mode with the subwoofer output set to around -2 or a +4 depending on what Pyle-Pro      sound mode (some produce a rolling low roar on bass or TomTom and other like the &#34;Rock&#34; or Power&#34; mode needs higher output)   I'm playing &#34;Rock, Power and Jazz&#34;.  The Kenwood surround system sounds pretty good. Definitely has the DEEP LOW BASS on some   of the sound modes.   But again I stress, the problem is:  just the right rich high end tone from the cymbals or hi-hat, just get a dull thrash.   And the Kenwood, though it's a 350 output system and unable to throw the powered sound out like I prefer either..   But this works better than the two guitar amps I used first. 3) And finally I just ordered a keyboard/ digital drum amplifier from Amazon. it's on it's way here now. See details below.   a BEHRINGER® model KXD-15 Keyboard Amplifier. It's a 600 watt with a TURBOSOUND® 15&#34; speaker and a one inch power horn   tweeter. the bi-amped design is suppose to give each speaker the punch of power they need to output that realistic drum sound.   I'm not sure if this incoming new amplifier will have that Low End Deep Bass I like at times or if I will need to plug in a separate   Sub Woofer into the sub woofer output jack on the new amp. Yes, it has a sub woofer jack...pretty cool. I hope   So, I will update this review once it arrives and I play it for a few days.  Pyle Pro Drum Set the pro's:   Easy to transport and set up compared to a real/ percussion drum set.   Sounds very nice   Nearly a realistic feel to the drum heads when hit and realistic sound  (the harder they're hit the louder they get)   Easy to use programmed sound modes (March, Jazz, Rock, Metal, etc)   User friendly easy adjustable head brackets and rods for custom positioning drum heads exactly where they feel best.   the two cymbals are kind of realistic but could be better. Of course that's where the high end models come in and cost increases.  the con's:   owners manual isn't very informative such as using the SD card record. I still don't know how to use that.   foot pedals aren't as professional feeling as I'd hoped for.   cymbals sound and feel could be improved  Again though, that's more for the high end expensive models ps- buy a couple pair of quality drum sticks and shop around to find the best fit and fell of stick weight for your playing style, I prefer   the rubber coated grip models. they really do well and hold nice. UPDATE: I received my new amplifier. It's a keyboard/ digital drum amp. brand: Behringer  model: KXD15                  the amplifier is great, sounds awesome. The drums have that high end thrash and deep bass. Sounds very realistic                  BUT, the Pyle Pro preset sound modes produce a very low sub woofer signal so using a powered sub woofer                  pug on the rear of this Behringer amp does the trick. Now the drums produce sound across the spectrum.   I love it.
