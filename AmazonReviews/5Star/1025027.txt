I have the shure glxd14, the bodypack fits perfectly in this. The Velcro straps makes it easy to put it on a strap and more importantly makes for a quixeeasy change if I want to switch instruments.yes the flap does cover the on/ off switch but it also is held on place by Velcro so its simple enough to acess.
