I like the amp, but upon arrival and after downloading the Fuse 2.7.1 software on my Dell Computer running Win 8.1 the software would not recognize my computer.  Worked with Fender support, but could not get the software to work.  Also, the channel two voicing would only work occasionally.  I've made arrangements to return the amp for a replacement so will reserve final judgement.  One of the suggested fixes is to use a second USB cable which I found absurd, but purchased another cable without success.  The sounds I did get with my Strat were great so I'm hoping second amp will arrive with no shipping damage or defects.  Time will tell.  Amazon was great handling the return.  Well, I got the replacement amp and everything works fine!  Ran amp and computer with an Eastman T184MX guitar and was simply amazed.  Put the Fender Strat away (sorry about that Fender), but this Eastman guitar really rocks with this amp.
