This is the best clip-on tuner I have used, and I have tried a few. I just did an outdoor gig with it on my acoustic, and the accuracy and functionality of the readout surpassed anything else I have used (Snark, Intellitouch, etc.) I was in bright sunlight, and I could read the display no problem. As I tuned each string, the display needle held steady and guided me to a more accurate tuning than I used to get with the Snark-and it was quicker too. The &#34;polytune&#34; function is useful, but it is not the real star of the show. The real reason to buy this tuner is because it works way better than it's competition, and is easy to read. Not sure yet if it is as good or better than the TC or Boss pedal tuners (both excellent), but it is certainly close.
