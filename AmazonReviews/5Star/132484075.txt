I have a few cheapo dynamic mics, but this is my first condensor. Admittedly, I am a total amateur when it comes to recording, but after plugging this baby in to my 8-channel Behringer mixer/USB adapter and opening up Audacity, I did a test recording and could not be happier. I recorded myself on vocals, acoustic guitar, ukulele and a tambourine all with the V67G and, to my amateur ears, absolutely love how it sounds. I had this on my wish list for well over a year because $$ was a little tight. Happily, the price came down to a point I could pick it up without feeling too much guilt, but honestly now that I have it and have heard it, I would not at all been uhappy paying the previous higher price.
