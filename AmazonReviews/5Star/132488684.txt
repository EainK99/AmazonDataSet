Love this Capo. It's is my second G 7th Capo. This is about as good as you can build a capo. Its solid as a rock and Does NOT distort or effect tuning.  Every single guitar player who I've shown it to has loved it! Silver finish is very durable. Nice present for any guitar player. UPDATE: March 2015 I purchased another G7th Capo for another guitar I own, and I received what is apparently the newly redesigned G7th. Hard to believe but it's even better than the original. Best part is its thinner than original and you squeeze the lever on the capo to release it which is opposite the original. Sweet, my all time favorite capo is even better ,
