I had read a lot about it humming real bad, but I thought I'd give it a shot anyway. At first I had some bad humming and was afraid that I had made a mistake by ordering it, but I realized I had a dirty pot in one of my effects. I cleaned it and now no problem. I have yet to use it on stage but so far it does exactly what it's supposed to do with no problem.
