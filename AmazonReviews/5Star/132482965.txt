Second time's a charm, I guess.  The first one of these that arrived was clearly a customer return, that was put right back on the shelf and sent out to the next guy (me).  However, the replacement arrived, complete, with a slightly damaged box (Quik Lok really needs to package these up better for shipping!).  However, other than the mouse tray adhesive cover thingy not really sticking (basically, an adhesive mouse pad that sticks - sort of - to the mouse tray), this thing is rock solid.
