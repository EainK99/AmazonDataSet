I just bought an Agile AL-3001 (if you're not familiar, please look them up, they are totally killer Les Paul copies that are Gibson quality and sooooooo inexpensive its nothing short of miraculous) and was looking for a strap that A: was really really long (I'm 6'2\\" and I like to play low) and B: looked good with a traditional sunburst flametop.<br /><br />This strap fit the bill well. The Beatles logos in white don't clash with the flametop (thanks to the black border, I'm sure.  I don't know if I'd have gone with this strap had I bought the cherry sunburst). I can hang that baby plenty low and still have room to spare on the strap.<br /><br />As far as build quality, this is the third PW Beatles strap I've bought, as they have all proven to be solid straps with soft and comfortable fabric.  Its even advertised as \\"vegan friendly\\" meaning it has no leather on it, so all those vegans who've always wanted to eat an entire guitar strap finally have an option that won't violate their diet and result in them being stripped of their [[ASIN:B0041T52S6 psychic powers]].<br /><br />Add some Grolsch beer bottle washers for improvised straplocks and you have a strap that'll last as long as the instrument.<br /><br />I'm sure soon enough I'll be buying another [[ASIN:B004SUP33W Planet Waves Beatles Guitar Strap]], this time for my Butterscotch Telecaster, I just love these straps!
