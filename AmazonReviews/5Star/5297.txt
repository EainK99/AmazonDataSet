I've owned a few pairs of these over the years. Easily my favorite headphones at this price range. Recently  I have been listening to more and more Bluetooth headphones due to the convenience of not being &#34;tied&#34; to the device that I was listening to, which is usually my phone.<br />A few weeks ago I came across a Bluetooth transmitter that I can plug my shure se215 into and make them bluetooth. The brand is Anker, about $25. Very small and alters the sound very little, if any.<br />Great headphones that are now bluetooth. I'm set.
