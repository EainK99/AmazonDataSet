This lapel mic works better than expected, and I always use the battery powered mic, versus using phantom power. It performs wonderfully, and I would whole-heartedly recommend this product to others wishing for a lapel microphone. 20 foot long cord, with option to connect a longer cord to it, for greater distance and freedom from the subject being recorded!
