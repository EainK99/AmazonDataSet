Frankly, these are my favorite headphones that I own for a multitude of reason. While I noticed small changes test wise from my old pair that was made in Austria compared to this new pair which was made in China, I can't honestly hear a difference and they feel almost exactly the same.<br /><br />Comfort: Supremely comfortable! The pads are above average, and the auto-adjusting headband works flawlessly still. The clamp strength is slightly below average, but I like that on these types of headbands. Full marks for comfort. Despite their size and softness, if the pad's bother you (large ears might be bothered by the circular pads), some Brainswavz velour pads will open the stage up even more and make the sound a tiny bit smoother while being oval, super soft, and fairly large.<br /><br />Sound: Very flat. Not as flat as say...HIFIMAN - HE-500's, but these are only $80 or less headphones. For the price the sound is very clean, flat, and presents a superb sound-stage. If anything, the mid's are ever so slightly above the rest. The highs are solid but fairly flat and the low's are some of the cleanest I've heard near this price; but they are very, very controlled. A lot of volume is needed to get any kind of &#34;thump&#34;.<br /><br />Looks/Durability: They look like the classic, infamous AKG 240's. No mistaking them and once you know what they are you see them everywhere, They look like studio headphones, because they have been and still are. I like the looks, the gold is much softer and less in your face in person. Durability wise, I've had a pair for 9 years that were in a box for many years before that and they are still going strong. I've never been forced to change a part, but they have a replaceable cord, the pads are simple to change, and the headband is replaceable with some patience. I would give these can's near top marks for durability, only lowered because if you're very rough on them, the plastic could crack. But the casing is replaceable and I've never personally seen a cracked pair before.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate these a 9/10, 5/5. Excellent for the price and outstanding as a whole. There are similar headphones that sell for 30%-40% less that have similar sound and builds, but they never live up to the originals. I think these are worth every penny and should last you for years to come.ersonally seen a cracked pair before.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate these a 9/10, 5/5.
