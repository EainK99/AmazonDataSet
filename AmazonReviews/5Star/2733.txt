A simple, well made stand that does what it is supposed to. I wanted a simple stand with no frills that offered a secure place to store my go to guitar. I have a couple more guitars being made for me, and I will be most likely be buying the double to display them. I have not experienced any rubbing or scratching, and that is with more than once finding my seven year old throwing my guitar into the stand in a hope I did not notice them playing it without permission. Aside from the, &#34;You need to learn to respect other people's property and musical instruments,&#34; discussion, it is all I can do not to smile as she has a great ear and  I think we will be getting her a guitar of her own and another one of these stands.
