I partly bought this as I didn't want to spend too much on a volume pedal. I went with this one, as I have had good results using Morley's other volume pedals (borrowed them, though, not owned any until this one). Also, my feet aren't too big, so I knew I could grok my way around this one.<br /><br />The construction quality is what I expected. It's solid, and seems that it would only break if a) taken apart and not reinstalled correctly, or b) run over by an 18 wheel truck. I've had this for about 1 1/2 years. It's mostly used at home, but I could rely on it in a live show.<br /><br />I have to try the fix suggested by Morley to improve the depth of the volume sweep. That should work wonders for me.<br /><br />Most of the time, I use this with four or five other pedals. If a compressor is used, I usually hook it up after that pedal. It always goes before overdrive or distortion.
