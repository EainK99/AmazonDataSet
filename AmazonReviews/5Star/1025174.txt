It's three clip-on microphones for $10, or ~$6.50 with Amazon Prime - it should be sufficient to say you get what you pay for.<br /><br />This being said, this sounds GREAT for a small cheap microphone like this.  While I'm not the most savvy when it comes to microphones, their hardware, and specifics of audio, I feel like I can say that it sounds great except for all of the static.  I currently have my mic volume at 100, with +20 dB on the booster, and only at this point can I hear myself clearly whether it's clipped on to my shirt or positioned in front of me, so that's likely why I'm getting so much static in the mic.  It's also plugged directly into my sound card.  With all this said, mileage will probably vary depending on how you're using this, with a wireless system, camera, laptop, phone, what have you.<br /><br />This is good for VoIP, video game chat, casual/student recording, and all that, but I'd consider getting something better for professional use.
