I'll probably get another one of these, it comes with a hole pre-drilled in the top, a rare thing for chanter caps, so you don't even have to modify it. It's kept my reeds nice and dry pretty successfully. Recommend to anyone on a budget who doesn't want to get one of those fancy $50 chanter caps, cause this'll work almost as well.
