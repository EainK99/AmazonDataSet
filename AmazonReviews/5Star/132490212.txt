I use Cymbal Safe case on every day basis since 2005., it is all what's expected. Case is hard and durable and provides adequate protection for your cymbals and it keeps them tight in place unlike some other cases.<br />After 8 years now and couple of European and domestic tours it is still reliable. Only thing is my 22'' Paiste Signature Heavy China does not fit in. Not sure if Zildjian makes cases for cymbals bigger than 20''.<br />In total great product, would highly recommend it.
