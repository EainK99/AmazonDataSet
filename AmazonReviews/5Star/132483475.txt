My parents got my 6 year old a real guitar for Christmas and he did really good with it. He was following the dvd that came with it and was teaching himself how to play and sounded... acceptable. Then my husband (who I am pretty sure has never touched a guitar in his life) decided that he would teach our son how to play. (because he knew *eye roll*) He very quickly broke a string. I got on Amazon and ordered some strings and tried to reassure my poor boy that the strings would be here quickly... they arrived a day that my husband was off early. I googled instructions, printed them off and took them home only to be met at the door by a sad 6 year old. Apparently this music know it all husband of mine decided he didn't need instructions and attempted to put the string on by himself. He broke the first one but reassured our son that there were 6 in the box so it would be fine. When I got home all 6 were broken and my husband had declared that the strings were faulty. I ordered another box of the same (because I was pretty sure it was less the product and more the user) and took the guitar to someone who knew what they were doing. Strings are great and there are 5 extras. (I have them hidden from my husband)
