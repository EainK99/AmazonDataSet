I love this unit!! The inside padding is thick, nice and soo soft!! The fabric is softer then my bed sheets so my digital piano sleeps better then I do! It comes with backpack style strapping to attach (this is what I use most) and a single strap that attaches near each end of the bag to carry. There is also a sturdy handle on the side of the case and at to far end of the bag. There is lots of storage on the top side of the case that i use for cords, music etc... If it came with wheels it would be the ultimate bag! Even though it does not come with wheels I still STRONGLY recommend this unit!!!
