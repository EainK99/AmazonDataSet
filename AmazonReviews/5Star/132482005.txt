If you are concern about the quality of a low costing Harmonica Holder do not fret. The Hohner Harmonica Holder HH01 is more than what I was expecting to get for that price. Customer Service from Total Music Source is excellent. I had tracking issues but that was due to my local post office. Total Music Source was helping me all throughout my ordeal and I cannot recommend them more.<br /><br />Now about the holder. It is made out of metal (the type of metal I cannot recall) but it feels very sturdy and the weight is minimal but feels of great quality. I play on a Golden Melody and it fits like a glove. The springs that hold the Harmonica are very strong and secure the harmonica very well. If I were to make any alterations, I would simply add a bit of rubber padding to the inside of the gripping portion of the Holder (I am paranoid about metal on metal) But there are no sharp edges on the inside of the grip yet that is just me. Honestly this is my first holder yet I am very satisfied. Once I adjusted the harmonica and tightened the Hinges it was very stable. I cannot recommend the product more. Low price, sturdy, and great customer service.
