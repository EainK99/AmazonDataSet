This works as intended. Had to contact Ken himself via the seller in order to get schematics. He was gracious enough to help me out. Thanks Ken!<br />  This imparts an acoustic tone to your electric. Either by a switch such as a push/pull or it can be wired to be always on. You put it in the circuit between the controls and the output. I get a beautiful sound out of the neck or neck/bridge combo on my Tele B-Bender with a P/P. No need to adjust the amp switches. Its right at my fingertips. Really nice either clean, with chorus/reverb or slight overdrive. It's like having a dual neck guitar with a simple pull. I play all of Stairway including intro with this gem. It always gets requested along with Freebird. I start at the neck with the scoop. Then kick up the volume knob and push off the tone scoop. Switch to the split coil/series/parallel humbucker I swapped out with the stock bridge single coil. Awesome!
