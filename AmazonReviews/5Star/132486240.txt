I got eight of these. The price was right,lucky me. Little more than plastic speed knobs, and these are metal and chrome with a set screw. Nice knurling work. Put four on my Ibanez hollow body and four on my Fender modern player tele deluxe thinline (knobs on those are just ugly, imho). What the heck, they are just knobs
