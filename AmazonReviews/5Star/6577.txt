I have one of these and it's amazing!! The quality of build is excellent!! This bridge has fine tuning screws like the Floyd Rose which, without a locking nut are sort of pointless. The intonation is easily set each saddle has the string groove width that matches the string that will rest in it, meaning the low E groove is much wider than the high E groove. I absolutely love this bridge and it definitely sounds great and is easy to set up but with a 400% mark up over all other websites that sell this, It's well worth your time to look around the net a bit because you can find this bridge all day long for ~$95 USD.
