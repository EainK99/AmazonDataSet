These are great, very bright with a remote to change color with different fading options an a adhesive backing that works well. The only thing that I ran into is the strip is pretty long and the products instructions are lack luster, couldn't find a way to shorten the strip to use less led's but thats not a deal breaker I ended up using more and got a better results because of it. I attached a picture to show how nice they look as accent lighting.
