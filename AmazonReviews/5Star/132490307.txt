I bought this bridge for my CC-50 banjo that had a 5/8 bridge on it.  My hope was that it would lower the strings, which it did.  My banjo is now much easier to play (I play fingerstyle).  The string height is now comparable to my guitars so it's more natural to move back and forth.  I ordered a second one for my other banjo hoping for equally excellent results!
