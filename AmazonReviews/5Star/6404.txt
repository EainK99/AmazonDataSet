So where do I even start with these.  Full disclosure - this is my first REAL foray into anywhere close to high-end headphones or studio-quality products, so hopefully that'll help temper the rest of this review.  Second piece of disclosure - I have none of the other accompanying studio or high-end audio gear that supposedly can make these headphones shine, so there's that.<br /><br />That being said, summed up in one word: amazing.  I have this on-again/off-again relationship with music.  I was REALLY into music for much of my college years, and now that I have a real life, it's really hard to have the same passion for music that I used to.  These headphones are changing that.<br /><br />I don't know quite what it is with quality products, but when you use them, you just know.  The build on these things is pretty solid.  Unless you're a serial abuser of your stuff, they should stand up to most any normal use cases.  The included cable options are pretty solid, too, although the proprietary connector from cable-to-headphone is a bit disappointing.  Other than that, fantastic.<br /><br />Now onto the sound.  Wow.  Just wow.  I'm really avoiding trying to oversell these things, but it's really hard to do.  Do they have the head-rattling bass of Beats et al?  No.  But do they have a really well-develop sound balance, including keeping a nice bass kick along with clear highs and solid mids?  Yes, yes they do.  And the soundstage is really amazing, too.  Almost freakishly so.  Where that really shines is when you have the listening volume set to a 'normal' level (e.g. not blowing your ears out).  A well-produced track will have really solid depth-of-field, to the point where I've actually tripped myself out, thinking I was hearing noises behind me or to the side of me that were actually in the song themselves.  Great example: My Love by Blackmill.  The 'crackling' can be heard far rear left.  Load it up on Apple Music or the like and tell me I'm lying.<br /><br />End ofstory/tl;dr - buy these.  Now.  Really, you're doing yourself a disservice if you're considering anything else anywhere close to this price point.  You will NOT be disappointed.
