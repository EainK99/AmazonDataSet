This case is surprisingly sturdy for a soft fabric case.  I use it for an antique bowl-back/taterbug mandolin, and it fits perfectly and feels very secure. I spent a long time looking for a hard case to protect it better, but bowl back cases are very hard to find in an affordable price range. This one seems to provide a very good level of protection.
