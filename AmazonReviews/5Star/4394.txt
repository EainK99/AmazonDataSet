It's hard to be Otto Link. Their mouthpieces are fantastic and they don't blow out your wallet. Considering a good mouthpiece can be a very important investment for musicians young and old, I'm happy to have Otto Link as an option.  These mouthpieces feel great, sound good, and play even better! I recommend this mouthpiece to all of my students who are developing and advanced, I have yet to work with someone who doesn't benefit from this mouthpiece. If you are undecided or unsure of what you should get, let me tell you that you can't go wrong with a Link!
