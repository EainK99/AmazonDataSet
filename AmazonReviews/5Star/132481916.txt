If you have either of the other 2 Monotron's you pretty much know what you are getting here. This might be the most fun to play with only because the keys are wider and it has different ribbon settings to make it easier to play notes. You can also get a thicker sound out of this, and crazy bass sounds. For just crazy noises this is probably my least favorite of the 3.
