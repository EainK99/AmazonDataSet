I wasn't expecting much for $4.00, but... these are well-made, of a good design, and actually work BETTER than some exponentially more expensive models used at Guitar Center, etc., in that they hold the guitar slightly off the wall.  You CAN put a protector behind it, but i you're careful and not living in a breezeway, you won't need to.<br /><br />I added a couple pictures, so you can see them holding both my electric and my Taylor acoustic-electric very neatly.<br /><br />Cn't beat the price or quality!  This is the way things SHOULD be made and priced!
