Excellent piano, especially for someone like me who has dabbled over the years and finally decided to learn how to play with both hands and not just the ears. It is a great hybrid of quality piano, entry level arranger and self-teaching instrument with the best in class/price point feature of a large, useful LCD display.  It is well ahead of its rivals in this segment of the market in terms of sound and features.  And don't buy into the notion that all these bells and whistles will distract you from your primary goal of learning to play.  In my experience, they greatly enhance the learning process. Having fun is a great motivator to move you from the couch to the piano stool.  128 notes polyphony is more than enough. And the choice of voices and styles is similarly plentiful. Could definitely be used on stage with external speakers.  Portable from room to room even when mounted on the very sturdy stand. Easy to detach from stand and take to a gig or on a trip. The addition of foldable travel bag which could double as a piano cover would be a nice bonus and one Yamaha might wish to add.  Play away!
