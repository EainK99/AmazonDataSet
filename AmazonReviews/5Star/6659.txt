These strings are great!! These were recommended to me by one of the guys at Guitar Center. I bought my first set from them and loved them so much that I just bought two more sets. I love how much volume that they produce on my Schecter Omen-6. Overall I don't have any complaints. I feel like I should change my strings since it has been about 6 months and I have played on the a lot, however, they still sound amazing and barely drop out of tune.<br />(The photo I included was after I had opened them)
