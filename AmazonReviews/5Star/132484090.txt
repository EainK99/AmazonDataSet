Bought a pair of Hollinger used from Music Go Round, one of the speakers was blown, it is ok because the cabinets are worth what I paid, plus they have decent horns, I bought one to replace the blown speaker and I am extremely pleased. The lows and mids are crystal clear at any volume. The first one sounded so good I decided to replace the other and what a difference! Excellent speakers for the money! Just hoping they with hold up through time.... Pushing 250 watts easily....
