These strings are by far the best strings you can put on your electric guitar. I don't care how long you've been using those Ernie Balls, they suck ba**s compared to these Elixir. I swear by these, and from my own experience these will last you at least 2x longer if not 3 or 4x compared to other ones, and the tone is amazing in comparison. Do yourself a favor and just give some elixirs a try and you will for sure be happy you did.
