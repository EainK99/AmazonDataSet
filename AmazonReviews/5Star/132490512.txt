Alright so I've had this pedal for a few months now and it is still my favorite pedal on my board. The Voyager is awesome for anything low to medium gain. It has three knobs: volume, gain, and tone. Each causes a very noticeable change, giving you a wide array of sounds. Depending on what you want to get from it, you can get anything from a (nearly) clean boost to a gritty, chunky overdrive. The pedal itself is very sturdy and it doesn't effect your tone hardly at all. Also, it is better to use a straight 9v adapter rather than an L-shaped because the jack is a little bit inside the casing. If you plan on velcroing it to your board, it comes with a completely flat bottom, if not there are stick-on rubber feet that come in the box. It also comes with two Walrus Audio picks and a Walrus Audio sticker.<br /><br />I've been able to use this both when playing lead at my church and when going for more of a rock sound with my band. Overall, Voyager is the best overdrive I own and is a great pedal.<br /><br />Pros: Wide array of sounds, Great tone, sturdy construction, Looks good<br />Cons: The click is a tiny bit loud when you turn it on<br /><br />10/10
