As everyone else mentioned, these are fantastic sticks. They last long, they're made in America, the black color also lasts long. While it's true that black marks end up on your cymbals, these are not permanent but can be wiped off or cleaned easily. Something else to consider- the convenient price! These cost about half of what most sticks are costing these days. I can't recommend these sticks enough. Black Nova Vic Firths are the only sticks I'll use.
