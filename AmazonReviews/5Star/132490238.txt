I am traveling around the country a lot.  I use these for music or when I am watching a movie on my tablet.  The sound is excellent.  The base is very nice without being overpowering.  I used to use the very popular over the ear noise cancelling head phones, but set them on the shelf years ago.  These are easy to carry.  I don't need an extra carrying case to bring on a plane.  They fit fine in my pocket or laptop bag.  I don't feel like I am loosing anything on sound.
