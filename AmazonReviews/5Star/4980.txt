Everyone who is planning on buying a guitar should have one of these in your pocket. Looking at guitars, thinking you might wanna take one home? Whip this out and look for high frets. I've seen cheap Epiphones with great level frets and very expensive Gibsons with high frets. You never really know, and it's hard to tell until you get it home and start setting it up. Don't get surprised by a poorly levelled set of frets on a new guitar. Know going in, use this tool.<br /><br />It's also hand if you do your own fret levelling and dressing. Instead of blinding filing / sanding down all the frets, just address the few high ones and be done quicker and with less fret wear. Given how inexpensive this is as a tool, there's really no excuse to NOT own one.
