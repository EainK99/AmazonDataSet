The hardshell case is rugged, sturdy and has a good amount of room in it to fit the pedalboard and your cables etc. The board itself is lightweight aluminium and has space to mount a power supply beneath the board. Velcro and cable ties are included, as is a bracket to fit a Voodoo Labs power supply. If you don't have a Voodoo Labs power supply, you can purchase a Universal Bracket that allows you to mount power supplies from other suppliers (e.g. T-Rex Fuel Tank Classic). A great product.
