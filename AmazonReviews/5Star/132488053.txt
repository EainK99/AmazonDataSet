I installed the UREC7 in my sound system and it performed as stated in the instruction manual.. Recorded to a flash drive, then played back the recording. Removed the flash drive to my computer, and it played back OK, (as a Way file) I then converted it to a MP3 file. Unit performed to my Satisfaction. Note! You can play music with a flash drive with the unit but it does not have a single play. Also there's no stop control on the player part, you just have to pause it. Only has a loop, and all play. Just remember it's number one (1) function is a recorder. Read the operating instructions. The remote works good with my unit. I did not like hooking it out from my mixers RCA out. There's no way to control the input to the recorder and the meters are at max using it. Distortion can happen to your recording. I do not use my control room out, so I now use it to send my recording signal to the UREC7. This allows me to control the input signal and it gives me a better recording. Hope this helps. Would recommend this unit to all looking for a Flash/SD recorder.
