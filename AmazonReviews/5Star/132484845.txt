Whenever I need an instrument cord, I turn to Spectraflex. Their cords are of the best construction and are almost indestructible. With these, I don't get that &#34;worn out, loose connector, noisy, popping&#34; condition that happens to most other cords over time. Based on my experience with Spectraflex cords, this cord will last longer than my memory of the purchase. I can't find a better cord than these without paying at least twice as much. I recommend it to anyone who will be using their cord for anything other than a permanent setup.
