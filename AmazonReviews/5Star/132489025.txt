I've been looking for a light for my Optivisor.  I bought the accessory one that is made by the visor company.  Too little light no matter what they say about their product.  I had taken to gluing temple pieces from my broken Foster Grant Lightspecs on to the hood.  It was better but still not the ticket.  I saw this product at Amazon and I ordered one right away.  It's easy to install and boy does it work!  Donegal should include one with every Optivisor they sell -- it's that good.
