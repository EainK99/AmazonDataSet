I've been teaching myself harmonica (not hard with youtube) with a Hohner Old Standby C and came up on some beloved songs I couldn't play, so I got these.  Now, I don't know any other instrument except for those 2nd grade clarinet lessons, but I've been having a great time.  So I got this set.  I'm very happy with it.  First, yes, I've seen the prices that good harmonicas can go for, and yes, I've seen what they cost!  So as a beginner, I'm not yet ready to invest in that kind of expense.  I want something I can learn on.  My F high notes are the most stiff.  Yes, all these are a little stiffer than my 'Old Standby' but I understand stiffness is common with new harmonicas AND if I can manage to learn on these then I will already be a step ahead when I graduate to better quality harmonicas.  It's like learning to drive on a stickshift-  once you do that, everything else is easy. If I can get those high notes on the F to talk, I'll be ahead of the game.<br />For the money, you won't get better.  These aren't to take to a professional gig, but frankly it's a drop-dead astounding deal on 7 Hohner harmonicas.  And who knows?  If I plop these in a glass of vodka for a bit and play them frequently and loosen them up, they might just be all that I'll ever need to play at a small folk concert in a local park.  Once I'm good that is.  Which may be never.  But that won't stop me, neither will a little reed stiffness.  Not at this price.  For metal instead of plastic.  For Hohner Blues Bands.  For 7 of them.  And a case.<br />Come on, of course you can't expect concert chromatic for this price.  But for this price, you'd be crazy not to get a set to kick around on.
