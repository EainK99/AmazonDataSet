Great bundle.  Mallet heads are not very good at all, so order some better mallets for the xylophone.  Everything else is great though; great piccolo snare sound, if you are into that, which I am.  I don't use the music stand for the xylophone that comes with this set, so I can't comment on it, since I have a real music stand.
