Have to say that this little delay does a lot of things very well.- from studio-like delays to tape and analog, and lots of other options.  I love the 'dynamic' delay, which sort of buries the delays when you play a series of notes, but kicks in at the end, so the delays don't muddy or conflict.  Reverse is a trip, 'mod' gives a chorus effect and is really nice for long delays with the feedback turned up.  And of course, being able to choose the toneprint of your choice to plug in and adjust to taste, or create your own gives another selection.<br /><br />Aside from the fact it is small and gives nice delays, probably one of the key reasons I call it a keeper is the tap tempo ... engaged by holding down the 'on' switch until you hear the sound go silent, then strumming the tempo.  Makes it much easier to sync with you song's tempo.  The switch for changing the number of repeats takes some getting used to, but has some usable settings.  Overall ... a good bargain in a delay with good tone - which is key for me.
