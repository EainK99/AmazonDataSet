I had a es go pickup in my Taylor gs mini, but it buzzed like crazy and didn't have much output. The pure mini in a gs mini is a perfect fit. It replicates the sound beautifully! It doesn't mess up the sound of the guitar acoustically either. I've only plugged this in at home in my amp, but I can't wait to plug this in at church!
