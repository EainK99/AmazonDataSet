Cheap, effective, and does what it's meant to do! I've been using my desk to hold my keyboard for a while and its been taking up alot of needed desk space.<br /><br />Only con is that it doesn't have an board to hold the keyboard on. it depends on the two bars that its placed on, but they have rubber to keep the keyboard from being slippery. So it doesn't really matter to me!<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone!
