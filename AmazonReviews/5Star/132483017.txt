We purchased this Clarinet for our 11 year old son to play in band.  I was very surprised to find that something so cheap came with so much, and played so well.  Most band instructors will probably require you to buy different reeds than the ones that come in the package, but that is more of an eventuality than a necessity.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is starting out and to anyone who doesn't want to, or can't, make a rather large financial commitment to getting their child equipped for band.
