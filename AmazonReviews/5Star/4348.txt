Picked up one of these on sale (from Sam Ash, not amazon...sorry).  It is an absolutely great instrument.  Rich, warm tone.  Lots and lots of sound.  Holds a tune for days.  Solid, one-piece wood neck WITH an internal adjusting rod.  It sounds much better, not just a little better, than my $350 Lanikai baritone UkeSB!  Great action and oh so easy to tune, even though the one weak link I would say is the gearing, with tiny little handles.  But for this price, and the sound this baritone puts out, it is still a steal at this price.  Buy a couple so you have an extra around for friends and play duets.  That's twice as good.
