Lets say your on a budget and a party is coming up, this is the buy you should go after! I started out with two speakers and a small mixer; once this tiny laser system was added to my system, my business took off even further. This little device fits on the palm of a single hand and encapsulates a few hundred red and green lasers that move in all different kinds of fashion. This is a spectacular piece of machinery and is ideal for weddings, dance parties, quinceaneras, anything you can think of! Personally, my next buy was a smoke system because once you have a somewhat fogged view of a room with this laser system in it, the lasers come ALIVE! Even without the fog machine, I was able to make much impact on most of my gigs. The system comes with a remote with easy instructions but I almost always have it on the mode that follows the beat of the song I am currently playing at the time. When everything is on beat, the customers are happy and notice things like that. You have the choice to prop the laser system on its two legs (as shown in the photo) or you can install it onto an O-Clamp (See my page for more info about that) which holds the system in place very well. The lasers do not shoot into the same position over and over; they seem to sweep through a series of modes to cover anything in front of you: top to bottom, left to right. Just know you really DO NOT need two of these, a single one of these can cover a gym when positioned correctly. But if you are a mad man or man woman and enjoy the illumination, please get two! Keep it centered where you are located and it will do the job well. Thank you American DJ, this Micro Galaxian Laser system is inexpensive, powerfully bright and effective for all to see!!!<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Compact and lightweight<br />2. Impressive illumination of lasers<br />3. Internal fan keeps the device cool<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Nothing really to say here but if you want the FULL effect of a laser show, GET THE FOG MACHINE. They are half the price of this laser system by the way.e half the price of this laser system by the way.
