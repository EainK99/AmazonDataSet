This stand is awesome.  I had a Hercules Stand for 3 Guitars. Just like that one, this stand is stable, compact, efficient, and super engineered.  Holds guitars, madolin, and ukulele securely. Works on Bass Guitar as well as Acoustic and Electric.  One thing:  a wide 12 string neck does not fit perfectly.
