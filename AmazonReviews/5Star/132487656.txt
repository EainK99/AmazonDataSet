I'm just going to say that after doing one google/ dj website research and read, read,<br />Read, ohhhh yeah, and read. I found a pattern. These pair of babies are in every list rated as top high quality s****! When I first heard the brand I thought it was kind of a joke, until a dj friend of mine told me, ohhh yeah man those are the s***! Off course, they might be a little bit pricey, but just wait for a good deal and you'll have definitely one of the best headphones put there.
