There is not a lot one can say about a capo--it either does the job or it doesn't.  The Nordic capo does the job and then some.  It appears to have a stronger spring than others I have used, thus eliminating any buzz.  The most incredible thing about Nordic is the customer service.  I received a notice from Nordic when my capos had shipped from Amazon.  I received another email after they arrived, and then still another one making certain that I was satisfied.  In my very considerable experience in buying via the internet, I have never encountered such attention from a seller.  Nordic Essentials should be the poster child for customer service.  Thank you!
