For the price which is lower than most of the disco lights, this one is just amazing. the only tricky part is to install it at the right place for the lighting to reach throughout the room. the light is bright and the motor does a good job in rotating the light at a decent pace to set the mood for a home party. I have a pretty big living room and just one of these was enough to cover the room. I received this for a discounted price in exchange of my unbiased review.
