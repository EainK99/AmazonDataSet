We just bought our son a Fender parlor guitar after he outgrew his 'playmate' guitar. After investing in his new guitar, we wanted to protect it. This seemed to fit the bill. It provides enough protection from the bumps and scrapes it'll eventually get. It won't protect it from dropping, getting stepped on or hit by a runaway locomotive, but for getting to and from his guitar lessons and the occasional family get-togethers it is great. And it's great that he can wear it on his back as well as just carry it.<br /><br />We especially love all the pockets. He can keep his music, guitar picks, tuner, (earplugs), etc. all in this case and ready to go. The bonus of the selection of picks and the guitar strap was really nice too.<br /><br />All in all, a very nice case at a very reasonable price.
