This is the best product I have ever purchased.  I looked at expensive turntables with recorders built into them and was not impressed by the costumer reviews.  I decided to try this as it was very low cost and got a good review.  Well I can say that it deserves more than 5 stars because it does everything and does it easily.  Just load the software into you computer, then hook the provided red and white RCA cables from your turntable into the converter, then plug the converter into your computer with the provided USB cable.<br /><br />The software walks you through what to do next, I needed to call the support line to get the converter to recognize my turntable (this was fast and easy, the person who helped me spoke English and quickly guided me through setting my laptop within a few minutes), then I simple continued to follow the directions to just begin the recorder and start my turntable, that was it!<br /><br />There is a great feature which lets you visually set the volume recording level to make sure that you do not over amplify and &#34;peak clip&#34; the music, once you set it to a good level it stays there, that's it.<br /><br />This software DOES separate the tracks for you (some of the expensive turntable recorders didn't even do that), and I just let the recorder keep running and flipped the album over to record both sides, which makes not difference converting to mp3s.<br /><br />Once the recording is finished you manually put the album title and track titles on it and push done and it automatically puts the album into your iTunes library.
