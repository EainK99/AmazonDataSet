This is really a fun little drum.  The sound is actually kinda nice, and not as loud or offensive as many children's toys.  The animal artwork on the sides is really nice, and my daughter has fun pointing out the animal faces she sees.  The size is just right for toddlers.  Also, the drum sticks are nicely padded balls on the ends of short sticks.  In fact, the sticks are toys in and of themselves.
