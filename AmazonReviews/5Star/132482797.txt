This is way cheaper than seismic audio or other brands but all the reviews were good so I took my chance. I won.<br />Everyone channel worked. Cannot tell any loss on audio quality with my ears. It was twice as heavy as I thought I may be, and that's a good thing. Socket grabs xlr tight, no wiggle at all.<br />Now I don't have to worry about mic cable length.
