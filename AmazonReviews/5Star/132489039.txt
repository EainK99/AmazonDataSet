Alright, I never write Amazon reviews for anything.<br /><br />But I plugged this little guy in and laughed for two hours straight. I'm not a particularly good guitar player but I had a ball with both the surprising loudness and the really convincing amp modeling and effects that are built in. While you can't dial in any of the effects like you could on a pedal, they are all pretty rad. Buyer beware: you're going to get a bit of line hum if you turn it past half gain but I feel that the haphazard wiring in my apartment is partly to blame.<br /><br />This thing is rude as hell and you should buy it.
