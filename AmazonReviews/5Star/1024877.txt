Easy setup. Easy display to read. Tried on both acoustic and electric guitars. Device worked very well for both. As someone who has worked with electric guitar tuners since the 80s its wonderful to have an indicator that doesn't bounce around after a string has been tuned.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning - KLIQ customer service. Superb!
