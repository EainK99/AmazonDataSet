An amazing go to pedal for low wattage amps and then some.<br /><br />This is my staple &#34;Always on&#34; pedal when running my Fender Champ 600/Vox Ac4/Vox Night Train or other small wattage non reverb amp.  Turning the soul food side to low gain cleaner sound, increases harmonic response without over coloring the sound while allowing the guitar volume to have great control of the tone.  3 pedals in the loop, a Pork Loin, JRC4558D pedal and then a delay.  With a flip of the switch everything can get tossed upside down with the reverb first -&#62; effects loop -&#62; soul food as the post gain.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and sit down with this to get it dialed in.  Decent sounding gain, but gets a tad grainy when dimed.<br /><br />Pros:  Good tone, easy to operate, controls pretty straight forward.  Effects loop and order of effects switch can do unusual things, mess around with this before playing live and changing it up.  One of the best reverb replacement pedals I have ever heard.  Good pedal to be PAIRED with other overdrives.<br /><br />Cons: Does not play well with solid state amps or modeling effects.  Does not actually contain turnip greens and has no nutritional value what so ever.
