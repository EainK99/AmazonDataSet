After reading reviews on a number of websites, we chose the PWMA8601 for our Agency. Several times a year we conduct fund raising events, such as golf tournaments, trail rides and &#34;Ducky Races&#34;. We also gather our staff and volunteers for meetings, training, and &#34;In-services&#34;. So far we are very pleased with the sound, number of features and ease of use. We are very happy that we chose a Pyle sound system. The system worked flawlessly and even without giving training our staff members were able to use and adjust the system.  Our quest speaker also commented that it was a great system!  I can recommend this system to any small and medium size group.
