This item came quickly, and is true to the picture Amazon displays, and is described accurately.  I gave it to my grandson for his first birthday, and it sure made a hit with him.  He is musically inclined, if you can believe a one year old is.  He loves anything musical.  He even hums.  As soon as his mom helped him open this present, he immediately started tapping away on this drum, with a nice beat.  I would definitely recommend this if your child likes to express himself/herself through music.  It is made nicely, it looks like it will last him quite a while, despite his active use of it.
