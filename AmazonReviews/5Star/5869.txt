I received this as a free review sample and frankly expected it to be perfectly accurate because even cheap tuners are. I was happy to find that it was also noise-free, so the claim of true bypass is accurate.<br /><br />You WILL need a 9 volt DC power supply, which not included. Also note that there is no battery compartment. I tested mine with a [[ASIN:B00191WVF6 Planet Waves 9V Power Adapter]] (which I recommend if you don't already have a power supply.)<br /><br />Since there are ample product specs on this page I am not going to regurgitate them. I tested all of them and all turned out to be true.  I will highlight a few features that are not glaringly obvious. First, of you are on the A=432 side of the argument that A=440 is not an accurate reference tuning (or you want to achieve a pre-1930s sound while performing), then you will be happy to know that you can set this to A=332 or A=335. Actually, you can set the reference frequency for A between 430 and 450. You can also tune flat (down to bbbb).<br /><br />My favorite feature, though, is I can actually read the display on the floor while standing. For my sixty-six year old eyes that alone earns this five stars. Also, while the dimensions are given in the product specs, the weight is not: this weighs in at a little under 4.5 ounces, which when used in conjunction with the included adhesive Velcro strips will keep the tuner in place. Another thing I like is it comes in a heavy, fitted cardboard case that will protect it if you are using a home made pedal board that you breakdown between gigs.<br /><br />For the record I tested this with both an Ibanez acoustic electric and a Fender Jazz bass, running to tube and solid state amps for the Ibanez and a solid state amp for the Fender. I used 21' and 12' Monster classic instrument cable on both sides and carefully listened for any pops while in passthrough mode.<br /><br />One final note: when you toggle the power on to tune your instrument no signal will be sent to your amp.o your amp.
