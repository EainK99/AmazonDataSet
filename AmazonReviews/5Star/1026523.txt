The CAD Audio D90 Premium Super cardioid Dynamic Handheld Microphone is a really nice microphone.<br /><br />Build<br />The build quality is very good and the mic has a solid and impressive heft to it. I have no doubt this mic would hold up well under &#34;road&#34; conditions.<br /><br />Sound<br />The sound of this mic was strong and clear. It was a pretty &#34;hot&#34; mic - it cut through other sounds with clarity and strength. I can see this mic being great for singing in a band where the singer needs to keep in front of other sounds. It also picked up voices much easier than others - I could sing a bit further back from the mic and it still picked up my voice very clearly without a lot of background noise.<br />One thing I’ve noticed is that every microphone has its own effect of whatever is running through it. Voices and instruments sound different on different mics. It is why singers need to try a different setups to find the best one to complement their own unique voice. In this case, while I felt the mic had some great sound qualities, it didn't really match my voice really well. My voice tends to accent higher pitches and needs a mic that is smoother over the entire sound range, but with more “oomph” in the midrange and lows. The D90 seems to emphasize the higher frequencies more.<br /><br />Comparing to other high quality mics.<br />For the purposes of this evaluation I compared the D90 with several other mics in my arsenal. I ran the mic through a TC Electronics Harmony G-XT vocal processor into a Soundcraft mixer and Sennheiser HD-280 Studio Pro headphones.  I liked the way my voice sounded on this mic, but it wasn't the best mic for my voice - that would be a Shure Beta 58A, which does costs quite a bit more than this mic. In fact the other mic I have that I thought sounded slightly better (for my voice) was the Blue Encore 200, which is an active dynamic mic - requiring a 48v power source to work properly. The Blue also costs more. I don’t think either of those two mics are necessarily worth more – the D90 is a fine mic, it may work out really well for you. Two mics that the CAD Audio mic sounded better than were the Electro Voice PL80 and the Peavey PVM 535 (both high quality mics). Neither of these mics articulated vocals anywhere near as well as the CAD Audio D90, and are more comparable price-wise.<br /><br />I plan on taking this mic to gigs - I think it will be great for backup vocals, or for singers with a huskier voice who needs a bit help articulating midrange and higher register sounds. I would definitely add CAD Audio to your list of mics to “check out”!ink either of those two mics are necessarily worth more – the D90 is a fine mic, it may work out really well for you.
