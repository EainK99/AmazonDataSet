I own and play multiple string instruments. This is a good, quality violin, worth the money. I purchased it for my daughter as she started school orchestra. The overall appearance corresponds to the description and pictures. The finish is not perfect but the wood grain looks very good on both the front and the back of the violin. The sound quality is very good as well.
