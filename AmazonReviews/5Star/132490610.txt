At first I was skeptical of these headphones because they looked pretty cheap but I went out on a limb and boy was I wrong. Even after owning these for close to two years, putting them through countless abuse they still run perfectly. On top of this I could wear them for hours on end, maybe even days and not have a sore head or ears. These headphones have some of the best sound quality I have ever heard and I would recommend them for anyone and everyone. If this is your first time buying quality headphones the price might seem a little steep but in my personal opinion they are worth double this, go out on a limb and take the plunge, you will be surprised.
