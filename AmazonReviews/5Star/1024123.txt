The keys feel great and the response is satisfying. You really feel like you're playing this thing, not just tapping a bunch of keys on a cheap piece of plastic. The velocity sensitivity is also great, although you may have to use the Korg Kontrol Editor to change the velocity curve to your liking. The default setting requires you to hit the keys fairly hard to get full velocity, which does allow for some very intricate playing styles, but may not be what you want for every application of this device. The pitch and mod wheels work as expected, not much to say there - the spring in the pitch wheel seems fine to me. The lighted octave buttons are a nice touch, and are quick enough that you can change octaves on the fly without missing a beat. The real value of this keyboard comes not only from the general build quality, but also the bundled software and VST licenses. You basically get a full stock M1 softsynth with your purchase (although the version that comes with the microKEY is more limited and doesn't allow for expansion), as well as licenses for other VSTs and even a copy of Reason Limited (basically the older equivalent of Reason Essentials) - not bad for an $84.99 keyboard. No complaints here.
