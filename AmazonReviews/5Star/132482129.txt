Open it up and play with it.  If you don't like it at first, keep fiddling or change the position on the board...careful with the trim pot. MY EXPERIENCE...settings that make single coils sing aren't so hot with a JB or Burst Buckers. It did not do well behind my OCD...I read Keeley's suggestions and went back to putting it early in the chain.  I have a JHS The Prestige in front of it with no boost dialed in and these two are the basis of my clean Strat sound.  You have to understand that this is a pretty subtle effect unless you get carried away.  You might end up (like I did) figuring out that if you can hear it, you should back off the settings a touch.  You will miss it when it is off.
