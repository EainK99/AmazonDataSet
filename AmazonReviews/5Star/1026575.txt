LIKE: Super great sound. Long cord (verging on too long).  Comfortable fit.<br /><br />DISLIKE: Plug is very fat, so don’t expect to be able to connect it to a phone if you have a case on it. (But, it is a sturdy design, so the cable is not likely to break easily at the plug.)<br /><br />NOTE: One earpiece stopped working after a little over a year; however, ATUS is repairing it under warranty.
