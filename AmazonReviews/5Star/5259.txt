This is a must have for anyone using pics especially those who acquire credit cards they don't want I just made some pics from a credit card and even my wife loves it she had to have one. This product is extremely well made feels like heavy steel construction and will probably last a lifetime. If your tired of spending tons of money just for a few guitar pics get this and use old credit cards or get some plastic blanks and make all you'll ever need for pennies on the dollar.
