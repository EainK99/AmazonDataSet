I just ordered my second pair. I have tinnitus. These have saved my hearing more times than I can count. I can hear what's going on outside, but I can't be startled. And what I've noticed is, because I walk around tense, a bit scared something will blow up around me and cause the steam-hissing sound (sometimes it's whistling) to go crazy in my head, these have helped me relax.
