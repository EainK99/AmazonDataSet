Zildjian. I am not surprised that ToonTrack has ignored (for the most part) what I consider the best historical, crafted, sounding cymbal. This fact alone has led me to buy the package however it seems that along with my long wait for zildjian to appear in the ToonTrack line of samples it happens to be one of the best EZX's I've heard. Hopefully a \\"Rock Solid SDX\\" will emerge soon. You never can tell with ToonTrack as they have been confused and non-supportive of the very first customers who put them on the virtual map with the very expensive purchase and tedious operation of the original \\"Drum Kit From Hell\\" in 1999. I was one of those first customers.<br />Regardless of my disdain for ToonTracks customer service and product history retention;<br />kudos to ToonTrack and \\"Rock Solid\\" I've waited a long time for this cymbal set alone.
