Absolutely fantastic sound quality. I have owned these headphones for almost a year now and they don't disappoint in style or function. I thought they were too clampy when I first purchased them, but after a week of use (probably 40 hours), they loosened up and are very comfortable. They also retain a &#34;new&#34; look for quite some time, if you take care of them.
