I looked at portable stands that other people in the ensemble had and thought about what I needed to have as we were playing in many outdoor summer concerts.  The stand I was using almost blew away during one rather windy day and it wasn't heavy enough to hold all the music.  My new Hamilton stand fit my needs perfectly.  It is solid, holds my folder with all the music and I have attached the hanger for my violin and know that it is secure.  It folds up easily and fits well into its case so that I have no problem carrying it along with my violin.
