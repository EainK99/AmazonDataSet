Hello all,<br />Beautiful instrument, the stock strings ring true when properly stretched.. It was apparent to me as I was traveling with it... Car rides at temp etc... As guitar player you can not help but to plug it in:)<br />Everything is playable ,  including metal, reggae, r and b . Etc. this guitar is made from a real manufacturer and feels like it.<br />It sounds better than acoustic ukes and plays like a devil when plugged in.
