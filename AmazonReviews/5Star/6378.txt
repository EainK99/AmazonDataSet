I took a risk on this pedal before any reviews and I'm glad I did.  I wanted to build a mini pedalboard and needed a modulation pedal with multiple effects to save space...this was the perfect solution.  With some tweaking, 16 modulation effects in one pedal is just awesome.  They are all usable with no volume drop.  Is this a Strymon M&ouml;bius?  Nope.  But it's great for what it is.
