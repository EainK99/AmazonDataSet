I bought this to replace the windscreen on my Rode NTG-1.  It's the exact same thing.  It works well to reduce wind noise, although if you're in moderate to heavy wind, you'll want to use a deadcat or blimp.  My old one lasted six years, hopefully this one does, too.<br /><br />I think if you wanted to use it with the Rode VideoMic Pro, you'd have to cut it down.<br /><br />If you were thinking about using this for a longer mic like the Sennheiser MKH-416, it won't quite fit.
