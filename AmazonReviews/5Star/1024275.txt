I absolutely love this case!  Its very lightweight and extremely protective.  It comes with two backpack style straps and two small cushions to adjust the fit for other guitars.  I bought this for my Seagull Excursion Grand, and it fits really well with the cushions!  Even though its made for parlor size, the outside is about the size of a full size guitar because it is so well padded.
