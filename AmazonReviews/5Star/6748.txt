What a great guitar case!  And I feel relieved that my guitar is safe from the severe dryness we experience here in the high rockies.  Such a nice design, very heavy duty and protective. Handsome, too.  I've gotten compliments from other musicians in our community.  The humidifier part (a sponge in an inset unit, basically) is so easy to re-soak in water and place back in the case.  I just check it every 3-4 days for moisture, and that seems to be plenty.
