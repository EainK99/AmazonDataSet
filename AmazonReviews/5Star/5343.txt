I purchased this record player for my husband's birthday. He is so very happy with it. He couldn't wait to hook it up & play some of his records that have been collecting dust. This nearly 50 year old man, was like a little kid on Christmas morning! Lol. So exciting!<br /><br />The player works perfectly! Hubby was amazed that records that used to skip on his old player, played through smooth, almost as if they were brand new. It saves him a lot of time, money, & probably heartbreak of having to find & replace his old favorites. Set up was super easy too! And it so user friendly. Even I, who has never touched a record player before in my life, can use it.<br /><br />Happy Hubby, Happy Home.
