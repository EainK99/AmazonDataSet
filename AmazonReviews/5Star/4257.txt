This guitar is not like my better Martin, but I bought it for taking to guitar classes. The pitch tuner didn't work well in the E6 position. It did not come with a full set of extra strings like described, so when I broke one of the thicker strings while tuning, I had to go out and buy a new A string. But when I asked the seller if they could send a new pitch tuner and the full set of extra strings, they sent a whole new package and provided a return shipment label to return the old. Great customer service. And a nice guitar for the money. I did buy a canvas bag to use instead of the one in this package - it's just too light and the zipper pulls broke right off. But a great buy for a beginner I think.<br /><br />The replacement was the same as the 1st. The 1st guitar replacement was in a little better shape. The replacement came with even fewer guitar strings (1), but the pitch tuner works better. So, kept the best of both shipments and sending the rest back.<br /><br />I think this is a great guitar to learn with. If you have a nicer guitar you don't want to take out into the elements, this is a perfect option to take out. I'd recommend buying a set of replacement strings so if you break one while tuning you aren't done playing for awhile. I also recommend buying a better carrying bag. I bought one for $16 on Amazon and it's a great canvas bag for this guitar.<br /><br />Customer service was exceptional. Thank you!
