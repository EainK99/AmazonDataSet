I have always been a music lover! Love album covers, concerts, I even play a few instruments, and I always look for ways to express this passion. Bingo! I found it. I read other reviews about the colored ones and the paint chipping, so I thought silver was safe. Turns out it is sexy too. Highly recommended!
