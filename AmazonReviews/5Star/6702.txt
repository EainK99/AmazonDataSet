This is a very good vocal mic, especially at this price point. So far I have not used it for any instrument recordings, but others have commented on its ability to nicely capture guitars and other instruments. The look and finish are impressive and the build solid. I have several MXL microphones in my collection and all have provided excellent results without any issues.
