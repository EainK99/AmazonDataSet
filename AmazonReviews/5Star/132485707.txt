I thought my fiddle bow needed to be cleaned or repaired until I got the Andrea rosin. I'm strictly a fiddler, so don't know how classical violinist would find it, but I found my bow performance vastly improved.There was nothing wrong with my bow, I just needed a good rosin. This is it. Well worth the price!
