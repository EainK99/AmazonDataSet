I shopped around and found this strap for a good price through Amazon. I am pleased with the quality of this strap. I went to the local guitar shop and the leather ones were really expensive. I could have purchased a cheaper strap there, but for the same price at Amazon, I decided on this one. Its more distressed than in the pictures, so keep that in mind. It isn't like a belt, it has some character. It looks good with my Root beer colored guitar. I imagine it would work with almost all guitars.
