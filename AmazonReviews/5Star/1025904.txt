I purchased these clarinet reeds for my son's clarinet as extras just in case he broke the reeds that came with his clarinet.  Much to my surprise, my son only needed to use on of the reeds due to their durability.  I highly recommend the Rico Bass Clarinet Reeds for anyone seeking a durable clarinet reed.
