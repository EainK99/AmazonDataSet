Sound is great and very pleasing with gaming and music.<br /><br />I bought this used $112 from amazon warehouse, and it looked very new.<br /><br />The adapter is detachable for those who don't know.<br /><br />The only thing that bugs me are how the headphones clamp on too much on my glasses. Not much of a big deal but it can be to others with sensitive glasses lol.
