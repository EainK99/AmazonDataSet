I am a big time music fan, yeah you heard it right I listen to music almost 80% of my waking hours, ranging from all sort of metal trance, pop, ambient and other songs from various other parts of world. I got these after doing tons of research online and also after testing the same one my friend had, I am literally blow by the crystal clear sound it delivers, the bass is so precisely balanced with treble. I would recommend it to any one who is looking for headphones below 100 bucks. There are great reviews for headphones above 100, but I would say I am very happy with my purchase.
