I have lost much of the high frequency response in my hearing, so I was missing a lot of the conversation when listening to television. I bought this equalizer plus some adapter cables so that I could take the output from my Directv receiver, go through the equalizer and then to my headphones. With a little experimentation boosting the high frequencys, I am able to understand almost all program conversations. It should also work well if I wanted to listen with external speakers too.
