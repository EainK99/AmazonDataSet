I own 2 pairs of these headphones. Finding a signal is very easy and the sound quality from the earpieces are of great.These were given to me a couple of weeks ago as a family gift and even to this day I use them with almost all of my sound systems such as my laptop, desktop, cellphone, television, just to name a few.
