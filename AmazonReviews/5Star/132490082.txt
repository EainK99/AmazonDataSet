I recently purchased this bass guitar to FINALLY learn to play bass.  Main reasons for buying this one were because it's cheap, it's blue and it's an acoustic as well as electric.  I was not let down on any count.  It has a decent sound and a beautiful finish.  When I started playing guitar, I started out with a Jasmine acoustic and a BC Rich electric.  This guitar isn't quite at that level, but at least isn't far from that mark.  It's a great beginner bass.<br /><br />Couple things that I should note.  Build quality may vary in terms of color, but mine is definitely blue.  The descriptions states it has an amp cable, but does not state whether it comes pre-strung or not.  The guitar IS blue, the guitar did NOT come with an amp cable and it IS strung.
