Hi this is the first microphone I've bought from MXL and I have very suprised how great it is! I can have the dogs barking, ceiling fan on with the door open and the microphone ONLY picks up my voice, The sound is very clear and rich. I 100% recommend to anyone looking for a microphone, it's just as good as any $200 one!
