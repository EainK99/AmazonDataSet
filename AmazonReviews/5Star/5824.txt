Fantastic all around drum heads. I've been using coated G2s for a few years on most of my kits. Great attack on a newer kit like my PDP. But at the same time they have a lot of roundness and warmth on a vintage kit like my Rogers. Plus they tune up really easy. I recently did a restoration on an 80s Ludwig Rocker, I threw these on and had a clear round tone with very little fine tuning, even with the 30 year old resonate heads still on the drums.
