Awesome value, and these cut my setup and breakdown times in half (literally!)  I didn't have any issues with slippage or fitment on my T-Stand, so I can't address that.  I can address the sturdiness and build quality of these clamps, and it is fantastic!!  They come with all the extra bits you need to get all your fixtures mounted and ready for quick-release.  I've converted my entire lighting setup over to these O-Clamps now and will never go back!!
