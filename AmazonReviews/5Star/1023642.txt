don't spend $300 on a single pedal. I've played axis and trick and demon drive and the rest. None of them came close to this thing. I don't know about How long it will last and stay in good condition, for I have only had it for a few days. That's right. Practically out of the box, this thing was ready to go with a small adjustment here or there. I tried every adjustment that axis and trick had. Axis A series featured the variable drive lever that they claimed could make the axis pedal feel like any other pedal. It never felt like the speed cobra 910. The speed cobra 310 is a different story, but it is nice as well if your on a budget. But back to the 910. The &#34;cobra coil&#34; rebound spring under the footboard is hilarious how perfect it works. My double strokes on the kick have sped up a good bit. And this for $180 is a very acceptable price. The axis pedal and trick pedal I used were $300 and both starting squeaking right after I started playing them. I hope this review helps a lot of drummers make a wise choice in the difficult decision that is picking a pedal. And just a tip for people looking for really high quality cymbals for 1/2 the price of the good brands, stagg cymbals. Amazon has all of them. Check em out. I have 9 cymbals all b20 bronze and hand hammered for less than $800. Buy one per paycheck or one a month or whatever you can afford. Definitely worth it. Cheers
