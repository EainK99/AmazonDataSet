For many years, I've used Dominant G-D-A strings with Pirastro Gold Label E string for my violins, for the combination has been well tested and proven for outstanding sound.  Last year, I've watched a YouTube video which compared various violin strings on the same violin, and I was impressed with the sound of Evah Pirazzi (EP) Gold strings.  But, since they cost twice as much as the Dominant combo, I had been very reluctant to purchase them.  Last month, however, my curiosity finally induced me to purchase and try them.  My immediate response after playing them was \\"WOW.\\"  Buttery smooth G-string (Gold wound) was just unbeatable in tonal quality.  Other EP Gold strings are also outstanding in producing warmer and more focused (concurrently) sound (in comparison to the Dominant combo), but the improvement on the G-string was the most noticeable on my violin.  To me, the EP Gold strings is the right choice for my best violin.  Needless to say, I am well pleased.
