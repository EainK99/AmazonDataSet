I put this set of strings on my Ibanez SR705 bass, and they sound terrific. They're a little more expensive than regular strings, but they're really nice sounding strings, and they feel really nice, too. They have a rich, clear tone, and they have a nice punchiness to them.<br /><br />If you've never tried flatwound strings before, give these a try. They do have a very nice, smooth feel, and they seem to decrease finger squeaking a bit too. Overall I am very pleased with these strings. They're easy to tune and play, and for flatwound strings, they sound surprisingly good.<br /><br />I've only used these strings for a little over a month now, and despite their slightly higher price, these strings are looking like they might end up being my go-to strings.<br /><br />If you have any questions about these strings, please feel free to ask, and I'll try my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.
