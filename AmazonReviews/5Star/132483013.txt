[[VIDEOID:d2866ca2d3300fad2e92b17e2bba93c9]] I recently did a video review of 3 different inexpensive Lavalier mics - this one, the Olympus ME15 and the Azden EX503.<br />The Sony was by far the best.<br /><br />Here is what I liked about it:<br />- Sound quality for me was \\"good enough\\" In other words after I used it, I had no desire to look for something more expensive.<br />- Right angle plug - perfect for attaching to a small recorder and putting in a pocket - (I use a zoom H1)<br />- Short cord, but long enough.  The cord I think is about 4 feet - that's plenty yo get from your shirt to your pocket.<br />- Stereo Mic - not a huge deal, but very convenient in that it avoids any needed follow up editing.<br />- LOUD - this was the loudest of the 3 mics I tested, this means that you will hear less noise with this mic vs the others.<br />- it requires some power, which the Zoom H1 provides and I believe most small voice recorders do as well.  It does not work with the macbook pro's built in headphone jack, but I don't believe any of the mics do.<br /><br />Why I bought this - I wanted to record myself giving a lecture, and I wanted something that I could put in my pocket and walk around the room with. The Zoom H1 is the perfect (small) size for that and it seems a lot of Video people are using them for just that purpose.  To do the video, I recorded the video on an iPhone and the audio went to the Zoom H1. The iPhone is also recording sound. I brought the two together in Final Cut Pro, where there is a feature to synchronize the sound from the zoom with the sound from the iphone - at that point it was easy to shut off the sound on the iphone and just hear the mic through the zoom.  No Audio processing was done, however I did have to compress the heck out of the video to get it to fit here on amazon, there is a less compressed version on that popular tube video site...
