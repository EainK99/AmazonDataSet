I am a music teacher and have used these recorders for years. They are cheap but they sound ok and they are durable. I have ordered over 1000 of these over the past years and very few have broken. One review said some were sharp, they are pitched at 466- who knows why but they work for home practice and mostly all my kids have them- I teach elementary school where we have a few types of classroom recorders and nothing is pitched perfect anyway. Dollar store recorders are horrific- for the same price you can get these which do the job really well. The draw-strings break on the bags where they are melted together but if you tie the string prior to giving them to the kids they work fine. Write their name on the bag, scratch their names in the recorder and you are good to go. In my old school district we all got the brown Angel recorders with the gold band, they were super durable and sounded great. If money is no object get the Angel two piece plastic recorder but I work in title 1 school where the kids don't have much money but they can all come up with $2.00 for one of these rather than 5 or 6 bucks.
