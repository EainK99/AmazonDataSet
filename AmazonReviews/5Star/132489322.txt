My 1990 Strat Plus had a bone nut installed by a guitar tech to replace the original Wilkinson, which he considered to be junk. His replacement job was less than stellar in my opinion and the strat would always go out of tune after using the whammy bar. I thought about replacing the bone nut with a Graphtech Teflon-impregnated nut, but after reading everything I could find I went with the LSR.<br /><br />Installation was a little different than standard because of the tech had correctly put a small piece of rosewood in front of the nut to keep the scale length correct. So, I sawed out the small shim, plugged the holes with toothpicks and wood glue and let it sit overnight. Then I went with the installation instructions that came with the LSR. I bought a #51 drill bit online for the holes as I had seen that people had trouble when using any other drill bit. I also bought the suggested #0 Phillips screwdriver. Everything turned out quite well, but took longer than I had anticipated.<br /><br />As for the LSR, I floated my bridge as per instructions on YouTube (thanks Frudua  -  [...] , got it all strung up and tuned and all works fabulously. No more going out of tune even when I dive bomb.
