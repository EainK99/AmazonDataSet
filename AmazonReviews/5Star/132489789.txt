OK I hear the horn is a pain to tune, but the tuning slide is were the slide and bell meet. The section is a little longer then it needs to be. Next I have played this with trumpet parts with a swing group I am part of. I play bass trombone most of the time and picked this up when I over planned for my bass, so my roommate being a trumpet player performed on it for a marching band preformence. The big thing is remember to listen. I love the horn it is not a easy horn to play in tone, but being a bass player I play flat, so take time and if you are a trumpet player using a trombone slide chart remember when reading trumpet music middle C is the same as Bb.
