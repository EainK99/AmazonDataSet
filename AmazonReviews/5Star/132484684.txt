Ordered the first unit and it had a faulty fourth channel. Emailed Amazon for exchange and they forwarded to distributor. Had a new one in three days and it performs great!  Had some reservations due to price and then the bad receiver but it is well worth the money and the dealer stands by their product.  Would highly recommend it for the money. No doubt not recording industry level but very nice for our use at a middle school.
