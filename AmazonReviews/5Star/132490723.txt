Installed this on a Fender Squier Jazz Bass.  Basic design is smart and solid. Smokes the bridge it replaced which used cheap hardware and saddles that were not solidly planted.  I installed it with the original Squier bridge mounting screws to avoid opening up the wood on the body with the larger screws supplied with the Babicz. (just in case I didn't like the bridge and wanted to return it.)  I also ended up removing the spring on the E string saddle adjuster because while setting up my axe,  the fully compressed spring was preventing the E string saddle from being moved far enough away from the neck to bring it into correct intonation.  Its now been mounted on my bass for 6 months and I'm quite pleased with the improved sustain and the overall sound and the intonation has not required ANY further adjustments.  My axe holds tune better than before.
