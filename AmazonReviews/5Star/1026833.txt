First of all, this mic does NOT look like the picture. It is glossy and shiny, not the matte, brushed aluminum I expected. I called the company, thinking my mic was in a mis-marked box, and they said only the white snowball has a matte finish - ALL the other colors have a gloss finish. I think they should include this information in their descriptions. I have the Snowball Universal Pop Filter attached to my mic which hides part of the reflective surface. The tripod legs are sturdy. As a mic, it performs superbly. I've only used it for voice narration recordings, which have been even and smooth, with excellent sound quality. Amazing value for the price. Highly recommended.
