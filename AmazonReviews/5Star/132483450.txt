I bought an old trumpet with the mouth piece stuck, and the pliers and visegrip marks all over it. the mouthpiece was trashed and some of the tubes were pulled apart by some young genious not knowing of this really slick mouth piece removing tool! I bought the tool and in about 30 seconds the mouth piece came off. It wasn't an easy pull! I resoldered the parts on and bought a new mouthpiece. Without this tool, I think the whole thing would have been toast!
