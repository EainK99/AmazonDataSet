Be forewarned, this 1/4 - 1/4 phono plug adaptor is bigger than it seems ... It requires more space side-to-side than if you had just used a standard 1/4 inch instrument cable to make the same connection .... even with it being offset ...<br /><br />I believe the biggest advantage of this connector is the stability of the connection ... It will provide some lateral weight support for the items being connected .... For example, I used one to connect two pedals on my PedalTrain board .... This adaptor worked better than a cable because one of the pedals was hanging over the edge of the PedalTrain just a bit .... This adaptor provided just enough support to augment the small bit of Velcro still making contact with the pedal board .....<br /><br />5 stars for doing what it does ..... But you really need a specific purpose to use it outside of regular instrument cables .....<br /><br />Carl ....
