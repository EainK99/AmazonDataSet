Very well made guitar! D'addario Hard tension strings help to have less fret buzz on mine. I've had it for almost a year now and I absolutely love my guitar! I sat on it and chipped it but besides that, its a pretty good guitar! Great for classical guitarists and for a mariachi show! Very high quality, you must buy this guitar!!
