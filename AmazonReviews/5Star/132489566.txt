This thing is as nice a guitar as you could ask for especially for the money they are asking for it.<br />I bought one from Lane music out of Knoxville TN and couldn't be happier.<br />Good bass for the size and super articulate. The setup out of the box could be just a little lower but it plays fine and I'm not going to spent the money to change a thing.Its loud enough with just my fingers a pick really makes some noise. Each string is the same volume so nothing stands out more than anything else. Chords sound like an organ or piano. To be honest I don't think you could get a better guitar even if you payed 2500 or 3000 dollars for a Taylor or Martin or Gibson.
