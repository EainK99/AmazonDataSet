Cables are a big deal.  Folks don't recognize this and will run an instrument or system worth thousands of dollars using cable that looks like it's been in the back of a pickup tying down boxes.  Most of my cables that interconnect equipment are custom from a source that makes them from the best cable, the best components, etc. but I can't afford that level to run a series of speakers or microphones.  Most of my equipment use active speakers, so I don't have to use the heavy gauge stuff as I'm supplying a line signal as the amps are in the speakers.  I need a decent cable to do this and I've found these do the job and hang in there for the long haul.  I have some of these going back many years and seldom (if ever) have I had an issue.  I really like using these cables as well as the ones by Audio Technica for my mic, instrument and speaker cables.  Whirlwind makes good stuff.  I have one of their cable checkers which I carry everywhere.  I have owned and own Whirlwind snakes, and they're very well made.  I trust Whirlwind products without question.  They make equipment you can rely your sound on.
