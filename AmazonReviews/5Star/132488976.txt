Excellent product for what it is. Easy to set up and use! Product is lite weight before adding the batteries (2 x 9v required). note that the cable between the receiver and the camera is a mono to stereo connector - so no need to add additional adapters, etc... Packaging was very nice and it arrived in perfect condition! please see photos. Everything is included to make it work - just add your video camera. I am using it with a DSLR and it runs nicely. The microphones are adequate for &#34;spoken word&#34; capture - but not sufficient for music video sound requirements. I would bet that the transmitter and receiver will be fine with a  better microphone set up, but what do you believe you are going to get for around the money? I would say this is an excellent buy having purchased wireless microphones in the past for more than 3 times the money and getting much less. I would recommend this to a family member or friend - no problem.  (will post photos too)
