I bought this to replace the Yamaha pa mixing head that went belly up after years and years of service.  As my Yamaha aged it lost a lot of it's high end but still was very usable with adjusting the knobs.  So with this new one it is so great to have my high  end back.  The low end, the mid, and the high all work very well.  Low End meaning bass sounds or low sounds and the mid meaning middle sounds and high end means high and clean and clear sounds.  I have other boxes I put vocal and music through so I don't use the built in effects - I got the sound I want with those boxes.  So I am not helpful in regards to the built in effects.  UPDATE:  I am now using the built in effects and they work and sound great !!!
