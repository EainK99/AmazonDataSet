bought a few of these for last year to help \\"haunt\\" an fire dept safety trailer for kids.  we used these in combination with the trailers built in fog/smoke machine and fake spider web, and got great results.  Only needed two of them to have the sound on.  it was a big hit with the community. best part is they are battery powered so you can pretty much place them anywhere, and the batteries last a LONG time, did not need to replace them at all. on a tight budget and need some good strobes give these a try. they also make a black light version that goes great with the UV webbing and the kids costumes as they crawl thru.  Loved turning the safety trailer into the haunted trailer.
