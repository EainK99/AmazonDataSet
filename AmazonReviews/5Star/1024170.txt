I don't know what everyone else is talking about but when I first opened up the lights and found a power supply, the lights were flawless. All the buttons work perfectly while changing each color and mode on the remote. Then again, I have only tested it twice so I don't know longevity of the item but honestly I wouldn't care if I got atleast 3 months out of it until it starts to malfunction. Just make sure to buy the power supply recommended for the lights to get the best results. The right power supply is listed at the bottom of the description.   Cheap, works great, buy it!!
