I am very happy with these LED strips; this is the second one I've purchased in the last few months, and, like the previous reel, it's quite good.  It's bright.  It draws 4A at 12vDC.  It can be PWM'd to adjust the brightness, if so desired.  And, while I only have a handful of hours with my most recently purchased reel powered, the previous reel of LEDs - same maker, same design, same markings, same appearance - has around a thousand hours of usage now.  They get slightly warm to the touch, but that's about it.<br /><br />The color isn't quite as orange/yellow as the image shows.  I don't have a color meter, so I'm just eyeballing it; these seem to be a little less yellow than halogen lighting, but just shy of neutral.
