I don't want to rehash what others have already commented on.  Simply put-- the case is top notch quality and does it's job well.  The zipper needs to be broken in so go easy at first.  Most importantly----  IT DOES FIT 12 STRING GUITARS!!!!!<br /><br />I have two 12 string guitars ( one is a Hohner & one i bought thru Amazon - an Oscar Schmidt).  They both fit fine.  A little snug - true.  I figured out the best way to put in or take out either a 6 or 12 string. Point the headstock in it's storage space first and the rest of the guitar follows easier.  For removing the guitar, just the opposite.... pick up the guitar by the body (butt end) first and everything else follows smoothly!!<br /><br />Let me know if this helps any of you out there.
