This is the second case I ordered for my Yamaha CG 102 classic acoustic guitar.  The first case had thicker foam but it smelled of a solvent.  This case fits perfect! I was concerned after reading about different sizes in guitars.  My guitar is 39 1/2 inches long, 14 1/2 inches at the widest part of the body and 4 inches deep.  There is some room in the case beyond all of these dimensions.  Great case, the single shoulder strap is removable, nice pocket in front for music and a good carry handle.  I have a stand for the guitar at home so I pick it up to practice but the case is needed to protect it going back and forth to lessons. Yes, my guitar is inexpensive, it is my first but I felt bad when it accidentally hit the edge of my car door which resulted in a small dent. This inexpensive case would have prevented this damage. Great case, great price.
