I bought this as a gift for my fiance and he loves it! It arrived fully assembled and ready to play. I think it will take some tuning but straight out of the box it is definitely playable and has a nice sound to it. From other reviews, I think it may require tightening the screws bordering the front to tune it.<br /><br />Sidenote: It is also a great seat. I think 75% of its use is as a chair. Don't judge me.
