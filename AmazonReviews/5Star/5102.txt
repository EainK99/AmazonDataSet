At the start of this year I began playing the clarinet again after a ten year hiatus. With my old equipment in shambles I eventually bought a Ridenour 576 and settled on a D'Addario X0 mouthpiece. I then tried at least fifteen different makes of reeds, most of the. In several strengths. I read volumes about reed modification and bought various tools to try and get consistently playable reeds, and yet I was never able to find the perfect solution for me. Eventually I decided to give synthetic reeds a look and after some more experimentation I found that the Legere Signature was the right fit for my equipment and embouchere. Are they right for everyone? Absolutely not, as every player is different, but They are definately worth trying if you're looking for just the right reed. I love the consistency, the sound, and the resistance. In short, I expect to be playing on Legere reeds for a very long time.
