although the product shipped was not as pictured, I am extremely pleased with it. without doubt I will be purchasing additional items from manufacturer and seller. a true value in musical instruments.<br />I've many an experience with les paul styled guitars, (gibson, epiphone, ibenez etc.) and in my humble opinion this is one of the BEST playing that i have come across. The action is superb, construction solid, finish breathtaking and sound phenomenal. i would strongly recommend this to new players and experienced alike. for the money, it would be criminal not to own one.
