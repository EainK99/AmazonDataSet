I have a huge album collection and up until recently, the collection was just collecting dust.  I purchased this turntable with the intent of occasionally listening to an album or two.  I was wrong - This turntable is like a time machine and I find myself listening to my old albums often and find it to be very enjoyable.  The turntable is awesome!
