It you are not mechanically inclined or handy with any sort of hand tools - do not try to do this yourself.<br />Along with purchasing the pegs, you need to enlarge the peg holes slightly with a 30:1 reamer (how much depends on the individual violin). It would be very easy to enlarge the holes too much requiring a trip to a luthier to bush the holes. If attempted on a cheap instrument be ready to replace it as the luthier expense would exceed the instruments value.
