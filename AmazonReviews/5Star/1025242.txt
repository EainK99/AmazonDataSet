This is, hands down, the best bass DI I've ever used, and has become the beating heart at the center of my bass rig. A few years ago I wrote a positive review for the Hartke Bass Attack, which is a similar bass DI in a lower price bracket, and that one is still great but the VT is an excellent argument for &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. This DI costs easily twice as much as the Hartke but once I decided to trade up, it was clear this has more than twice the features.<br /><br />Tech 21's bread and butter is the &#34;Sansamp&#34; technology, using an analog preamp to let you play or record direct and get around using an amp. The VT Bass DI differs from the regular Sansamp Bass Driver in that it's part of their Character series, which are modeled after specific classic amps. The VT entry is a simulated Ampeg amp, and I'm not familiar enough with actual Ampegs to really compare and contrast but I know this DI sounds magnificent.<br /><br />The three EQ knobs are a crucial feature on any bass DI, and the Drive knob ranges from totally clean to viciously distorted - you could get by without owning any sort of distortion pedal and use this Drive knob for all your dirt-related needs. The &#34;Character&#34; knob is a little harder to define, but is supposed to sweep through a range of different Ampeg amps, with (I believe) the counter-clockwise position being more vintage and the clockwise position more modern and aggressive. The Blend knob lets you bring in some of your unaffected bass signal, which is less useful for clean tones but extremely helpful to maintain clarity if the VT is dialed in for face-melting distortion.<br /><br />There are some deeper features via small buttons (speaker emulation defeat, &#34;bite&#34; on/off, and a few others) and between those and the wide range of tones available from the main knobs, this DI is capable of a bewildering array of sounds, all of which are quite usable and very different from one another. The XLR out makes it easy to plug directly into a snake, mixer, or recording interface, and between that and the sounds available, you might never want to play through an amp again.to plug directly into a snake, mixer, or recording interface, and between that and the sounds available, you might never want to play through an amp again.
