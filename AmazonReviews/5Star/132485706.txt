The Vox Ice 9 overdrive pedal is like having 2 pedals in 1. It boasts a \\"vintage\\" and \\"modern\\" switch that gives you the best of both worlds. The \\"vintage\\" sounds like my tube screamer and the \\"modern\\" - well, it sounds modern. It also has a \\"more\\" switch for a 14db boost. So, if I want to stand out in my leads a bit more I will hit this switch. By the way, the switches are quiet which is great. I love the design of this pedal as well. From the chicken nobs to the blue LED's it looks as cool as it sounds. The only dilemma I've noticed from this pedal is a bit of hiss when I hit the \\"more\\" switch. It's to be expected though considering you get a volume boost. Great for lead/solo work as well as rhythm playing. I love this pedal. Check out the various youtube vids on this and you will hear how great it sounds.
