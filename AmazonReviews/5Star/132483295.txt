This is a great starter violin. I grew up playing Suzuki violin and studied privately starting at age 3.5, continuing all the way through high school. I am now teaching my kids to play and find that this violin works well. It is well worth the price to avoid the worry that comes from renting an expensive violin monthly. At this price, the violin pays itself off quickly. After tuning the violin, and rosining the bow, the instrument is ready to go. My goal for buying this violin was to expose my kids to the violin and interest them in playing. We get it out often and enjoy it. I would highly recommend this violin for a beginner. If my kids decide to continue playing after a year or two, I will then consider moving up to a more expensive instrument. But for now, we are all very happy with this purchase!
