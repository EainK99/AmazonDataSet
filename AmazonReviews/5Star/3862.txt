I LOVE IT! Fantastic pedal! I have owned quite a few of the more expensive univibe pedals which were somewhat bulky and had various quirks. I have been looking for a newer modern take on the legendary univibe pedal that could duplicate its legendary sounds but also have a smaller size for pedalboard use but also without any of the old design problems. This pedal does that for me and all for a price that is a fracction of the cost of boutique univibe pedals that I have previously owned. I use a univibe pedal on blues gigs in the vibrato mode mostly to simulate n old magnatone amps pitch. vibrato. Setting this pedal to vibrato with depth at 9-10 o'clock, the volume full up and the rate at about 1-2 o'clock gives me a great simulation of an old pitch vibration (also a great sound for Hendrix tunes like &#34;hey baby -new rising sun&#34;). You can also dial in a great Band of Gypsy's era or Trower like tones by setting the pedal on chorus with its volume full up, and depth at 9-10 o'clock and rate at about 10 o'clock.<br /><br /> aa etc).<br /><br />  and the rate at about 1-2 o'clock gives me
