I wrote a 1 star review for the graphite aquarian sticks.  Felt bad doing that, because they make great drum head, but their sticks were awful sounding on the cymbals.  These aren't.  In fact, they are as close to a wood tip sound on cymbals as I've heard with the durability of nylon.  So if you ever break your wood tip sticks at the tip, but love that softer sound, these will make a great practice stick.  You may even find they sound close enough to wood to gig with.  Nice feel too.
