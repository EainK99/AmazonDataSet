I have had this since the summer of 2015. This is a great amp for the price. The blue glow is quite nice too. If you are doing gigs for small groups, or Dj/Kj'ing at a small bar/club, this is fine. If you are going to use it for a large area where alot of bass is needed, this might be overworked. Don't be fooled by the 2000 watt claim.... this is at 2 Ohms on bridged mono mode (expect to replace the amp in less than a year if you do this as it will make the amp work at max and it will overheat alot). You can get about 500 watts per channel at 4 Ohms, but only a few people have or use 4 Ohm speakers for entertaining. Most people have 8 Ohm speakers, and you can get a clean 200-250 watts per channel out of it. This is more than plenty for my uses tho so it is fine. It also runs very cool at 8 Ohms. Only downside is this puppy is pretty heavy.
