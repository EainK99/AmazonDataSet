Bought this for my husband for his birthday. We are finally able to play all our old albums again, which number in the hundreds. The speakers allow you to listen while recording to cd, which is a nice feature, but we hooked the unit up to our surround sound/receiver system and it sounds great! Virtually no scratches can be heard.<br /><br />We haven't spent too much time recording to digital since his car's entertainment system is broken at the moment. But we have burned one cd and it worked great!<br /><br />It's quite easy to use.<br /><br />He loves it!
