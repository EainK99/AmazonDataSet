This headphone amp turned out to be just what I wanted. At first I thought 4 headphone inputs was a little overkill for my application, but I needed some extra volume for my Sennheiser headphones and this amp works well. It gives you a good amount of volume, my headphones have 50 ohm impedance and I am satisfied. And at a very reasonable price. Shipment was super quick too.<br /><br />If I were to significantly upgrade headphones at some point, I would likely need to upgrade the amp too, but that is expected. Clean sound up to the limits of the headphones. If they went much louder I should probably worry about my hearing, but no.
