I bought this for my studio apartment.  I had a bluetooth speaker, but it just did not have the volume I wanted.  This thing has more than enough volume.  I obviously have not turned it up all the way, so I'm not sure exactly how loud it gets, but I have had it up very loud.  The bass is not too heavy, but it does have some nice lows.  I've played jazz, blues, disco, and hip hop through it and they all sound great.  As far as the bluetooth is concerned:  I normally play my music through my computer and it sits on my desk, exactly 7 ft away from the speaker.  I have no problems connecting or staying connected, and I have experienced no breaks in the signal.  I can't say anything about the battery life.  I haven't used the battery yet, and I probably won't use it that much, except for the monthly discharge that the manual recommends.<br /><br />I had to edit my review of this product.  I read some bad reviews about the microphone, and they are correct.  If you're contemplating buying this product for a PA, you can do much better with something else. It is not loud enough. I still give this product 5 stars, because I did not buy it for the microphone.  I would have bought it even if it did not have a microphone.  Probably you could salvage the microphone function if you purchased a pre-amp for the mic.
