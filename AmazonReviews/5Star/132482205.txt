he came home (1st grade) and said it was 'into the tone block' - i searched it, not knowing what it was - and BAM, i got this for him and his music teacher even let him take it to school (they have all sorts of kinds and diff tones) to show the class and play :D 5 stars for the smile on my boy's face and 5 stars for a product just as described.
