I bought this flute for my 6th grader. It lasted a year. From what my daughter's friends said about the ones they bought on the internet, theirs lasted around 3 months no warranty. She played it frequently and was rewarded with two solos at the final show. $30 a month for a rental or buying this.....buy this!!
