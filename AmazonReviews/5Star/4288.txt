Very sturdy. The seat is substantial and comfortable. Lots of adjustability from 17&#34; to around 24&#34;  This stool will be used for a guitar student and it's one of the better ones I've seen. NOTE: There is no relationship between my family and whoever makes this product. I found it on Amazon in a search for a good quality stool. The fact that the name is the same is a happy accident.
