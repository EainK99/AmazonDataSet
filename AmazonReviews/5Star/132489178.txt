The Focusrite Saffire Pro 24 DSP is probably the BEST dollar for dollar.<br /><br />I had to get another interface after my Duet FireWire died of natural causes. It hurt, but eventually i would've had to upgrade it. I was quickly maxing out the potential of the Duet due to the fact that it only had an I/O if 2/2.<br /><br />After a week or so of mining the internet for every review of the interfaces i was interested in being, i finally settled on getting a Focusrite saffire PRO DSP.<br /><br />I was glad i did!!<br /><br />The Quality is excellent in this box. The mic pres are some of the best ive heard, it sounds jus as good as my DUET,there are plenty if I/O formants to choose from including SPIDIF and OPTICAL, and it works seamlessly with LOGIC PRO, PRO TOOLS, you name it.<br /><br />Best Thing to do when you get this Interface is to LEARN THE SAFFIRE MIX CONTROL PROGRAM IT COMES WITH!!!<br /><br />It will cut your latency issues down to little or none and works right along with your DAW to give you optimum performance.<br />It also allows you to have different headphone mixes for different musicians and producers so everyones happy.<br /><br />This is probably the best interface to have other than getting a rack mounted one.<br /><br />At 349.99 USD its a STEAL.<br /><br />Wish i brought this one before the DUET!
