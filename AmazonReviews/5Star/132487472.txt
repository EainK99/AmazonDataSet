When I got it I was a little nervous after I tuned it, and it didn't sound that great. Luckily I bought some aquila strings with it, and that made a big difference. It sounds really nice, and is starting to stay in tune more and more after a couple days now. The tuner it came with works good, and was pretty easy to figure out. The bag looks good, and is padded. I'm very happy with this product all around. Just make sure you get some aquila strings along with this uke.
