I started playing at age 11 and discovered these picks at 13. I'm 22 right now, and these have been my favorite picks all along! For some reason I can play faster, do arpeggios with more ease, and feel more dexterity in my right hand while using these picks.<br /><br />As far as I know, nobody else makes picks like this. I'd definitely recommend them to others.<br /><br />Love the color too...clear purple's as cool as it gets.
