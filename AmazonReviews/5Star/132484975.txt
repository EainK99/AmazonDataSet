The packaging was excellent, The box was the appropriate size, not to big not to small. The shipping was fast it arrived sooner than expected. The flute was wrapped in bubble wrap several times so as it would not be damaged. There was also the foam packing peanuts in the box for added protection. The flute itself is well made and is exactly as the description stated. I would recommend this seller to anyone and the flute to anyone looking for an affordable flute that has a good sound. I will be purchasing another flute in the future.
