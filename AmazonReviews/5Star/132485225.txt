I was looking for a 'beach guitar', one to use when not performing, or around kids, etc. Had a chance to purchase a Teton STS105NT from a guy who said it was like new. Got it cheap. Wow! Mint condition, and a really beautiful guitar. The work is absolutely great, the only thing I would change if performing with it is to file down the metal fret dividers. Man,this is as nice as my Guild or my Gretch. Amazing tone, sustain, and the bass notes are top of the line. You on the fence? Get it!!
