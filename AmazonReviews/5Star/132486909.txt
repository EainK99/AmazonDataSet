This is my first turntable and it is fantastic. I have moved 3 times with it and it is so sturdy that I never had to worry about breaking a piece. The needle sounds great, it has a really neat look and ads to my living room's appearance. Would recommend to everyone besides professionals who need a very expensive rig.
