I've been using 12's for 3 years now in a indoor large room.  the sound and compliments are excellent.  I do't drive them over 60%, but there is no need to.  I have the 400 Watt version.  Plenty loud with great sound.  I use them for Karaoke at least three times a month. And they are light weight..... no more lugging around a power amp and 70 lb speakers!
