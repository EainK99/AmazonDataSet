I use this at home to play my steel guitars.  It will hold a lot of music, easily adjustable and stays adjusted.  It is not too heavy.<br />I would like to see an adaptor available should a person want to ad more height for standing positions.  Perhaps there is such a thing I don't know.  Very good stand as was expected, no negatives.
