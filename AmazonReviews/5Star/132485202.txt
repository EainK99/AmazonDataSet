This is an ACCESSORY, not a sound producer. It IS however a great tool for live DJ-ing. It really does alot! Manipulates sound and makes track transisions a breez. I love this thing!! If your a beat DJ, or even a &#34;radio&#34; style DJ, or even just messing around, this thing is sweet! My kids just love using it to make their voices really high and really low or echo-ee. Lol. Like I said it actually does ALOT more!! If you have any skills or an imagination this thing is a must!!<br />Cheers.
