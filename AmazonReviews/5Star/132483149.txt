All I can say is Wow! This new Bass Station 2 is a producers' dream. It has so many cool features that I can't begin to tell you how dope it really is! I'm going to create so many crushing new sounds and beats with this piece. It wont make any sense! The design and look are solid as well as the controls and switches. You have a lot to work with as far as oscillators, envelopes, and filters to design some of the sickest sounds and patches. It comes with about 70 presets that are off the chart in my opinion. And if you don't like any of those. You can tweak them and make your own mind blowing sounds from scratch. It even has a built-in sequencer to make entire song tracks! With all the parameter manipulation and control at your fingertips. There's nothing you can't create sonically! From drum beats to sweeping sonic riffs and cords. This baby almost does it all. It also comes bundled with Ableton Live Lite Software and a Novation Loopmasters  Sample Sound Pack. (Really Cool!). If you are looking for the future of sound in a 25 key synth action keyboard. Look no further! Novation has gone above and beyond the call! Im loving my new Bass Station 2 synth! And even though it's my first. As sweet as it sounds. It may definitely be my last! I'm very happy I did my homework and got one. Worth every penny! I would definitely recommend to a friend.
