I am a university professor with a relatively low voice. I need the Pyle-Pro system for class rooms that are not big enough for their own sound system, but still hold 60 -80 students. The system works as advertised with minimum feed back issues. Couldn't be happier. The power tucks away when not in use. Give the overall performance of the product my two thumbs up.
