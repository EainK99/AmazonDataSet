I have been playing guitar off and on since about 1953, Over the course of time I have used all available thicknesses of picks. Recently, I bought and fell in love with \\"JD .48mm picks\\" in a box of 12. I can only assume that any thickness of JD nylon pick would be as well recieved. They stand up to \\"shredding\\", fast instrumentals and hard country. In my humble opinion, Jim Dunlop products are top rated if not, the very top.<br /><br />Kip Tyler3<br />Lead guitarist \\"The Tylers\\"
