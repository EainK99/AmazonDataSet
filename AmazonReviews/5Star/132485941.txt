Well I've had this thing for one day now and I am in love with it!<br /><br />I mostly produce at night due to my work schedule. My wife and son are sleeping when I come home so I can't really crank the monitors which leaves me producing with headphones. Although I can do a pretty decent job with headphones I always have to tweak it using the monitors the next day.<br /><br />Following that is the ultimate test which of course is the car. I often find myself going back and forth between the car and my studio making slight adjustments here and there. It can get pretty old. I pretty much hate all of my songs by the time I'm done with them because I have to do so many revisions.<br /><br />I tried the Presonus VRM Box first which really did NOTHING for my mixes and it made my master soundcard very upset after about 40 min of usage.<br /><br />Finally got one of these bad boys after using them for a bit at my friends studio. I just re-did the mix down on an older tune of mine (that I actually like) utilizing only my Sennheiser Headphones and ONE Mixcube. The mix sounds 1000 x's better!!!<br /><br />This thing will not tell you squat about sub bass, it just doesn't pick it up which is to be expected. The idea is that this mimics most of your lower quality speakers such as computer speakers, cheap car audio, or maybe even a phone...a good phone. This will not help with your super high end either, it doesn't have that air or crispness that your actual monitors have. However, when it comes to everything inbetween...ITS AMAZING!!!<br /><br />In my headphones I thought that my hats, rides, shakers, percussion, etc sounded pretty balanced but when I switched over to the Avantone it was a totally different response. I balanced all of that on the Avantone and then switched back...SHABANG! Sound perfect now!!!! Same thing for the vocals, pads, and mid bass. Mid bass for me is between about 100 hz and 500 hz. I could really hear the click and punch of the kick and snare too or lack there of and made adjustments while using the Avantone. Again; AMAZING results!!!<br /><br />One final great attribute i will mention about the Mixcube is that I can turn it up a fair amount at night and still not wake anyone up! The lower frequencies are generally what everyone upstairs can hear and this thing does not produce any of those frequencies so I'm good to go! :D<br /><br />As of now I am working with only one Mixcube. I'm not so sure that you need two. I suppose if you want a real stereo image than two would be necessary but...I don't think you need it. I would just use your actual monitors for stereo work and then switch over to this for mono and balance checking.<br /><br />If you are having any of the issues that I mentioned in the beginning...BUY THIS NOW AND LEARN TO LIKE YOUR SONGS AGAIN!!!<br /><br />-T-<br /><br />AKA: LOGAM<br />Drum & Bass Producer
