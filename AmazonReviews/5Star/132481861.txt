I been playing sax for 20 years. Professionally 15. Started playing these 2 years ago. My playing went off the charts. The consistency let's you focus on your tone and playing in general. Sounds brighter and sweeter than any cane i used. And you can play the full range and altissimo without a problem. Feels like i was living in the dark ages until i found out about these reeds..love it.
