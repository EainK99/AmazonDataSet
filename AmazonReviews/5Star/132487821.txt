I bought this for my daughter who was attending a summer music camp and needed a stand that traveled well. Our car was packed to the brim, but this fit nicely and it is also very sturdy, so it is now her everyday practice stand in her room.  It is easy to put together, break down, and reassemble.  You won't be disappointed.
