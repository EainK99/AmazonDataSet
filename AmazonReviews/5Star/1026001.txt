I've had these for almost 2 years now and I have to say they work as well as the day I bought them. I'm not going into detail about the product because it is a great product and many people rave about them, but I did notice that with frequent use the pleather (plastic leather) that makes contact around ears rub off leaving the fabric underneath noticeably exposed. Also mine smell like BO because I often sweat wearing them on warm days. EASILY FIXED BY REPLACING THE EAR PADS FOR AROUND 20 BUCKS! I would still give this product a 5/5 and I have recommended it to everyone.
