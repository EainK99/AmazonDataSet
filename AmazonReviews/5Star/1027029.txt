Great tuner. Picks up tone right away. Great for drop tuning metal. I play in drop f and it still picks it up. Very reasonable price compared to buying it at a guitar center or other music store. No swivel, no big deal. Just have to find a sweet spot while clipping it to the guitar as it is hard to read at an angle.
