This is an excellent desk mount stand for smaller / lighter microphones.  While it will not handle the weight of the broadcast standard microphones like the Shure SM7B or Heil PR40 this stand does a really nice job with handheld microphones and even smaller condenser microphones.  My MXL 2006 was just on the edge of being too heavy for the unit but the InnoGear condenser I tested a few weeks back worked perfectly.<br /><br />The stand attaches to a desk, table or other flat surface with a screw mounting system that you tighten up underneath your desk.  The stand then slips into that piece which allows it some room to swivel and the microphone attaches at the end of the stand.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the little plastic piece that comes with the stand that holds a normal handheld microphone also contains the small black piece that you'll need to attach other microphones to the boom.  Since there were no instructions it took me a second to figure out how to attach normal threaded microphones to the stand.<br /><br />This stand is nice and quiet and does a really nice job with lighter microphones.  I have a Heil stand that can handle just about any microphone that is about twice the size of this one but it is also much more expensive.  This is really a perfect boom for those just getting into podcasting as long as you're using a handheld or lightweight microphone.<br /><br />Overall this is a really nice stand with limitations on only being able to use it with lighter microphones.  It attaches and detaches easily and is a nice, quite boom.  It is not the largest or sturdiest stand out there but it is a bargain at the price point.
