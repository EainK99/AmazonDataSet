Quality of this is amazing for the price.<br /><br />Sadly, it did not fit my Mini Advanced Shoe on my Canon Vixia HF G10, but I took care of that by grinding off a bit off each side with a grinder (oversided Dremel). Holds the mike really steady and makes a HUGE difference in the mounted mic.<br /><br />I'm using a shotgun mike (This one: [...] this is an affiliat link) on my Nikon D3200 (the Mic was originally planned for my Vixia HF G10 Canon Video Cam, but that's a whole other story). Basically, this gets rid of the \\"camera noises\\" that a standard mike mount causes (i.e. lens operation like Zoom, Focus, etc.).<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this shockmount.
