Unbelievable how this tuner can help you get a better drum sound. Yes, it takes a few minutes to understand how it works, but after you get it down your drums will sound fantastic. There are great instructional videos out on the Tune-Bot site and you tube. Study, practice and tune. It's worth the time and effort you'll spend learning how to use it correctly.<br /><br />On one of my Ludwig kits I have a 14&#34; power tom that I've always struggled with when it came to getting it to sound full and rich. It was hit and miss to get it right. Using the Tune-Bot made it very easy to get it sounding killer and to remember how I tuned it so it can be repeated every time . I love it.
