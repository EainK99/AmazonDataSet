Excellent padding! My Ovation Legend 12 string fits perfectly in this quality bag. Although I wouldn't trust this on a plane, for everyday use it is perfect. It is much lighter than a hardshell case and takes up less space yet offers great protection at an affordable price. Phitz will be my #1 choice for instrument cases from now on. P.S.- After writing this review, I looked again at the Phitz cases, since I am thinking about getting another one. I noticed that the price can vary widely depending on the design you choose. I bought the Irish flag design for a standard size acoustic guitar and it was $19.99 + $6.99 shipping. Some of the designs cost more than double that! So unless you absolutely have to have a particular design, check them all before buying. Update- I have purchased another Phitz standard size acoustic guitar case, this time I bought the &#34;Comic Wings&#34; design. Everything I wrote about the first case holds true, except this one was only $15.99 + shipping! I really can't believe they sell such quality gig bags for so little.  Get one now before they raise their prices!
