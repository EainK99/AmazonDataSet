Obviously these are not the best headphones on the market. I can, however, say that I believe these are the best headphones on the market for this price. I have purchased headphones for twice as much, probably three times as much, that did not match anywhere near the quality level of this product. If you're currently looking at headphones under $100, do not spend an extra $20 thinking you are going to get more. I am floored that this product was originally $30, I do not understand why they're only charging $20 now. Do not let the cheap price fool you. These are great headphones (I use them as backup headphones for DJing, my primary headphones being Beats Solos by Dre) and have lasted me months. I usually cannot expect more than a month out of headphones with the abuse I put them through, but these are a sure buy!
