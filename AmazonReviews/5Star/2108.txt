Have been using for about a month and I'm getting solid results.<br />I have worked my way up to doing 2-3 sets of 200-300 quick full<br />pumps (all the way up and all the down) with each foot. Quite a workout.<br />The spring gives plenty of resistance. I had a very weak right foot/ shin but no more. Drumming feels so much more natural and easy now that right foot will<br />(generally) do what I want.
