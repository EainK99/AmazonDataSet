Perfect, loud and bright colored tambourine that can be spotted in the audience from a party goer that may not want to return it.  Great price.  UPDATE 2/19/17  Had to buy a replacement since my original was stolen from a gig.  The replacement I received was made lighter, the handle was not as bulky and it did NOT sound bright.  Had to return for refund - Thus 1 star for the replacement.
