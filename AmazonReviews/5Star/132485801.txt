At first I wanted SG Standard, but after discovering it's pretty much the same except finish\beauty details and pickups, I decided to buy Special.<br />This is my first American-made guitar and I totally love it! I got mine in worn cherry for a pretty low price I consider, and I was surprised in a good way by its appearance. It looks gorgeous and sounds even better!<br />It's very comfortable to play, sustain is sweet and sound is versatile, though the tone is a bit dry after strat, but that's SG after all.<br />I'm happy with this guitar. Don't hesitate, go get it!
