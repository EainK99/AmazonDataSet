So after reading multiple reviews on this product let start by saying the critics are dead wrong. This is an awesome product and it is not expensive to create the gobo's and it looks amazing. Nothing is faded and I used an Inkjet printer!!!!<br /><br />To create a custom gobo all you need is the following<br /><br />3M Multipurpose Transparency Paper it is $65 for 50 sheets<br />A Hair Dryer<br />A Scissor<br />and the Metal Chauvet Gobo (that came with the unit)<br /><br />Just print your gobo on the textured side of the paper.<br />Take any hair dryer and just lightly dry it to ensure the ink is 100% dry (you can wait if you want but i am always in a rush)<br />Once dried cut out a square around the circled gobo you just created.<br />Then take the the metal gobo that came with the unit ( i used the chauvet one since I will not need it at a party)<br />put the metal gobo over your created gobo<br />then use the scissor to cut around your new creation.<br />Then do as normal just pop it in and you are done. Oh yeah and use that manual focus.<br /><br />This will pay itself off in one event because others paid thousands to have more expensive units that do the same thing.<br /><br />If you want more info just email me at info@candidshots4u.com and i will be glad to help you get what took me all day to research on the net!!!<br /><br />Thanks Chauvet this was another HOME RUN PRODUCT
