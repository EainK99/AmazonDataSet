In this day and age it makes a refreshing change to encounter something that reflects clarity craftsmanshipand care .Such is the care that has gone into the presentation before you even open the box you know you are in for a treat.<br />Mark Bunney really has created a volume of work dotting every i and crossing every T so there is no need for you to ask questions its all here.<br />Mark is a courteous teacher , the book sand CD's reflect his wanting you the student to do so well you hear in his coaxing voice its almost like a  series one to one sessions with the Master himself.Mark's love of his instrument comes over so strongly you want to sound like he does and please him with your progress as though he is in the room with you ,in fact with his gentle coaxing style you almost believe he is.<br />If you are looking for a saxophone that will unlock the musician in you .... then you have found it !.You can only progress up the ladder swiftly with this style of tuition .I worked on the Sax Mastery course myself and made rapid progress, I also found every step of the way very clear indeed ,but most of all I found the journey not only exciting but a very enjoyable experience.<br />The course is set out in such a way that Mark helps you determine the time you need to devote to each session .<br />With Mark's ever present saxophone tones to guide you to guide you to your goal,I couldn't recommend a better better saxophone course that reflects the passion of the Master  more than Sax mastery does .<br />I want to rate the great Sax Mastery programme 6 stars and you will, when you find you can play so quickly .<br /><br />Marcus Reynolds<br />Brass embouchure Specialist<br />Lecturer for BAPAM.<br />Signed Artist to Michael Rath Trombones<br />Creator of Stratos Embouchure Systems
