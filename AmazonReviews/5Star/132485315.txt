I got this music stand to work on writing music at my piano instead of a small table.  It was really important to me to have all parts of the stand be able to lock so that I could angle the &#34;desktop&#34; so it was parallel to the floor and lock the height in so that the desktop didn't spill everything if I made the wrong movement and so the desktop would be locked in at the right height, even if I leaned on it.  It does all this plus has a smooth desktop instead of a textured one which makes it ideal to use as a writing platform.  And it comes with a little case it all fits into - the stand folder up to just the size of the desktop and is very portable in case I need to bring the stand to a gig or something.  Beats the crap out of my Manhasset!
