I'm a strong advocate in taking care having  pride towards your stringed instruments when it comes restoring them in the best condition possible. I have one MARTIN dreadnought guitar, ESP ELECTRIC/ACOUSTIC guitar and a JOHNSON 165 acoustic guitar that I play everyday and I use this product with confident and integrity in knowing  that it will give the up most  care in cleansing,waxing, polishing, and conditioning that is required in giving you that AWESON luster while providing you musicality and good INTONATION that makes your guitar breed and harmoniously vibrate worth  thru conditioning with the lemon oil luster on your fretboard for better musical TONALITY.I highly recommend this product to anyone.
