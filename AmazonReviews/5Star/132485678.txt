If you're wondering if you should spend the extra few bucks on the La Gorda cowbell over the El Gordito, the answer is yes. I have both and the El Gordito is VERY small and produces a shrill and high-pitched ring. Pretty annoying. Go for the bigger La Gorda instead. Perfect pitch, tone, and size! (See my product image for size comparisons of the two).
