I'm very pleased with the 4/4 violin outfit. The main reason being the excellent price, and secondly the quality of the product.<br />The outfit also included two bows, two bridges, an extra set of strings, rosin and a form fitting case.<br />I also purchased a mute and shoulder rest.<br />After refitting the bridge, tuning and treating the bow with rosin I have enjoyed getting back to making what I call music. Although<br />others may not agree.
