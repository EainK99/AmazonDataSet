Bought for my kid just getting into drums.<br />Great stand for the money ... better then a lot of pricier ones I've seen.<br />  - well built ... solid<br />  - rubber grips your snare and it tightens easily<br />  - feet are great even on bare floor<br />  - not tipsy ... sits solid<br />100% happy
