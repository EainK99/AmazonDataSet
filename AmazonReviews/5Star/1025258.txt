Great microphone and great range.  The only problem i have is antennas for the reciever are crap.  They have a plastic roll pin type thing that falls out.  If this unit had a well made antenna it would be perfect for mobile dj karaoke and small sound gigs.  I would not recomend this microphone for a recording studio.
