I play a Breedlove Atlas acoustic bass guitar.  I have had a hard time finding a gig bag or soft case to fit this instrument.  The hardshell case that it came with is great for storage and protection but it gets HEAVY to lug around festivals or downtown streets to gigs.  I did some research and figured I would give this soft shell case a try.<br /><br />The foam in this case is pretty rigid.  It almost feels like it has a plastic shell under the canvas outer covering.  Inside, it is lined with a soft flock, much like my hardshell case is.  The inside has a small storage compartment, which is just big enough to fit spare batteries, a polishing cloth, and a cord without much room to spare.  One could tuck some odds and ends in the space under the neck if so desired, I suppose.  The cutout for the instrument leaves a few spaces around my Breedlove, but ultimately keeps the instrument snug and tight (no movement inside the case with cover closed and zipped).<br /><br />Honestly, I would have liked bigger zip pockets on the outside, as this bag has the real estate to support them.  However, the outside pockets are big enough for my needs.  The larger pocket is just right to fit a three ring binder full of music and lead sheets.  The smaller webbed pocket has a zipper on each side, not entirely sure why for, but for now it is holding a spare box of strings with room to spare.<br /><br />The carry handle is placed in the same spot as my hardshell case handle and seems sturdy enough.  What I love about this case is the backpack style straps on the bottom.  This will make all the difference in the world when carrying my bass when parking is not so choice.  The hardware on these straps consists of beefy plastic clips that seem like they should withstand normal daily use.  The straps are also fully adjustable for length.  Keep in mind when carrying this case on your back, the neck is going to stick WAY up over your head.  If you're a tall guy like me, you're going to need to watch doorways, low ceilings, and ceiling fans.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this case and would recommend it to anyone looking for full portable protection for their acoustic bass guitar.
