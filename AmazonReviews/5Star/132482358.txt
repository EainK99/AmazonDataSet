I always hated how standard laptop mics sound, making your voice barely yours.<br />You sound like some kind of a robot. That was built in quite a cheap factory.<br /><br />So I finally decided to get a decent one. But I needed it to be mobile enough to take it with me.<br />I don't do podcasts or any fancy audio recording. I just use it for hangouts or skype.<br /><br />And whaddayaknow - I sound like a human being again!<br />Everybody I had a hangout with noticed that and they all were quite impressed by the quality.<br />And I do love it myself as well! And the ability to mount it onto the laptop's lid - very handy.<br /><br />Yes, it doesn't sound as good as an expensive studio mic. But it wasn't made to be used by studios in the first place.<br />And it won't rip you off, like all the pro equipment. I'd say it's a very good value for money.<br /><br />p.s. Works on Linux without any problems!
