I'm not any kind of pro piano player. In fact,I'm trying to work my way up to terrible. I just wanted a sustain pedal to use with my digital audio workstation for sustaining my virtual strings or whatever. I paid like $20 for this thing so I wasn't expecting too much but I was surprised to see the construction was solid and heavy enough not to fall over if you accidentally bump it from the side.The pedal itself responds very smoothly,looks good and feels good. I even left the plastic cover that comes on the pedal part on for now just cause I thought that looked good too.Real piano players who are picky how the action is for their use may or may not be so impressed. I don't know what they look for but I do know you get what you pay for and in my case, I think it is a great deal at a more than reasonable price.Time will tell how long it lasts but if the construction is any indication,this pedal should be around for awhile.
