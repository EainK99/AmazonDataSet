Not work for what I need. I was looking for a cheaper alternative for the lapel mic that is used with Phonak Compilot but the unit keep detecting the mic as a audio jack source what disabled the hearing aid phone program (for what I need it) and also interfere with my hearing.<br /><br />This no means it is a bad product is just it isn't for me.
