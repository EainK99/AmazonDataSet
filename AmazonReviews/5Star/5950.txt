Was way better than I had hoped. Purchased this for my son for Christmas and pulled it out the sound is awesome! I'm an intermediate player and have played different brands, the price for this quality is great! Thinking of getting myself one if only they had something besides camo and sunburst. Turquoise would be awesome or a solid blue one! The color and design is amazing!
