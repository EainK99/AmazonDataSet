Cant go wrong with this 2pk of 3 way switches. They work perfectly and fit into the guitar with no problems. These say &#34;cream tip&#34; which is correct, but also come with 2 black tips - an added bonus ! The price for these compared to guitar shop prices ($15 for one switch) is quite a great value, and the quality is the same. Shipping was fast (Fulfilled by Amazon). When the need arises, I will not hesitate to buy these again !
