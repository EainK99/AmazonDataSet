There is nothing else that compares to the quality of this product!  I have tried many other popular bridges and this one is the best!  Easy to install on my Fender Jazz bass and the benefits are well worth the price.  Improved sustain and clarity. The ramp system design that locks down is genius.  No more rattling parts with this design, any bass I purchase in the future will have this bridge!
