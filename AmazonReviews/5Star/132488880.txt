Note!! There are two versions with different lengths of this strap.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002E1NRI Super Bass Strap]] (33\\"-42\\") &lt;&lt;--- the one I'm reviewing<br />[[ASIN:B000P4FBQO Mega Bass Strap]] (43\\"-53\\")<br /><br />I'm 5'10\\", and wear mine at 37\\", considered high by most bassists. It's the same position when I'm sitting as standing. On me, this strap adjusts from 33\\" (center of bass body on solar plexus) to 42\\" (center on belt buckle). Pretty much, if you wear it below your belt, get the Mega. If you wear it above, Super. Mind you, extreme shapes such as a Hofner will wear differently.<br /><br />If you don't have measuring tape, you can approximate to your current strap:<br /><br />US Men's shoes sizes to inches -- 5 = 9\\" / 8 = 10\\" / 11 = 11\\" / 14 = 12\\"<br />US Ladies -- 3.5 = 8\\" / 6.5 = 9\\" / 9.5 = 10\\"<br /><br />Measure in...er...feet (:<br /><br />Past that - all the reviewers note the comfort. Fantastic! The padding is great, and it sits in place extremely well, but not so well that I can't adjust mid-flight - I've been bouncing around my house testing to see if the sproingy nature of the neoprene effected my playing. Very little travel compared to other neoprene straps, no ill effects. It was even surprisingly comfortable at max height. Coming from a 2\\" strap, my nine pound bass feels three pounds lighter.<br /><br />Good to note, you can't beat the price. The similar alternative option for comfort (or weight/back issues) would be a 3\\" Levy's, Italia, Moody, or other padded leather strap ($75-$125), or in extreme cases, something like a [[ASIN:B00DGCM91W Gruv Gear Neo DuoStrap]] ($75 - likely best route for severe back issues).<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />-tap
