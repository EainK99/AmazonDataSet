A fine design. I use it for guitar (alternate tuning) and bass in chromatic mode. I was easily able to tune my guitar in a noisy room while another musician was playing. Just a soft &#34;thumb strike&#34; on the string produced the desired results with no interference. You MUST read the manual that comes with the unit. Three buttons on the unit, some have multiple functions. Great value.
