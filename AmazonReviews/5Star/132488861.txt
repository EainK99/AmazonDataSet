The BBE Sonic Maximizer reminds me of the old \\"Loudness\\" switches found on many low and mid-range receivers and amps in the 1970-1990s era, however it offers far more control of the \\"Loudness\\" function than those simple On/Off switches of yore.  Think of it as a sophisticated \\"Loudness\\" switch with pots instead of a simply On/Off switch to control the amount of both Lo and Hi frequency \\"Loudness\\" boost.  The quality of the pots used to control the maximizer effects are high quality and have a smooth, velvety feel when turned and use high quality knobs.  Surprising to see pots of this quality at this price level.  Not anything like the much cheaper pots with flimsy plastic knobs used on most Behringer equipment.  Nice, BBE!<br /><br />As with the old \\"Loudness\\" switch of decades past, it does much more than just act as an equalizer to boost certain frequencies.  It affects the dynamics too by adjusting phase.  It only offers inputs and outputs for a monophonic-1/4 TS style jack so you'll need some adapters on the ends of your RCA cables to use it with typical Hi-Fi equipment.  I use Hosa GPR-101 adapters.  You can use \\"Channel A\\" for the right channel and \\"Channel B\\" for the left channel in a stereo setup.  It handled the line-level output from FM tuner without problems.<br /><br />I'm using it to adjust sounds coming out of a late 1970s analog tuner, a top-end model for that time -- a Pioneer TX-9800.  The Sonic Maximizer is especially suitable for adding a bit more \\"bloom\\" and life to sterile FM stereo sound.  The analog FM tuner signal feeds the BBE Sonic Maximizer and then goes into a 50w/channel Dayton AP150 amp.  This then feeds a pair of small JBL Loft30 speakers.  In a low cost configuration such as this, judicious use of the Lo/Hi frequency (Contour/Process) controls helps to add more punch and sparkle to the sound without causing too much ear fatigue over long listening sessions.  It's especially useful when when listening to music at lower volumes.  I keep the Lo frequency (Contour) pot cranked at 50% or slightly below.  The Hi frequency (Process) pot is cranked to about the 30% point.... any higher and it adds too much \\"sparkle\\".  Different speakers would probably benefit from different settings depending on what they lack in the lows and the highs.<br /><br />Let me be clear, if you have a relatively hi-end Hi-Fi system with very good speakers that sufficiently covers all the frequency ranges, you probably will NOT want to use a device like the BBE Sonic Maximizer.  It will only make your system sound worse.  However, for lower range Hi-Fi systems, it does a nice job at a very low cost.  I got my BBE Sonic Maximizer during a one-day special offer for $50.  At that price, it's a worthy addition to my current FM tuner setup.  It's not a miracle cure for a lack of dynamics and \\"punch\\" in a low-end system, but it certainly helps.the Lo frequency (Contour) pot cranked at 50% or slightly below.
