This adapter allows you to use two dynamic XLR microphones with the 1/8 inch stereo jack on your DSLR camera, video camcorder or audio recorder. It will not work with XLR mikes that need phantom power unless you provide the 48 volts externally first.<br /><br />The way this adapter is wire allows each mike to use its own channel. One comes out on the left channel and the other comes out on the right. Perfect for recording the dialog of two actors so you can mix in post at independently selected audio levels.
