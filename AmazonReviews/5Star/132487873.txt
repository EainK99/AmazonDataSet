I bought this so that I could record my voice lessons without resorting to the cassette tapes my instructor has used for years.  This little recorder has been the perfect answer.  It is just as easy to deal with as her cassette recorder, can even use her mics if I want, and the recording quality is far superior, and easier to access, as I just download the lessons to my computer when I get home.<br />This recorder also makes it easier to share my progress with family and friends as I can record a song and sent the mp3 to anyone who wants to hear it.<br />Excellent value for the money when you consider all that comes with it!
