My son purchased this and he really, really likes it.  It makes it very easy to tune his guitar!  In the past, he had to use the piano, but it was difficult to ear the tones perfectly enough to tune.  Other times he would have me tune it, but I wasn't always available to do it every time he wanted to pull out his guitar.  With this, he can do it quickly and accurately on his own.  Well worth the money.
