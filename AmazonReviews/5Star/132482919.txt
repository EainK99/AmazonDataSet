I got these speakers just last week and as a DJ, used them only once so far and they were incredible.  I have a tri-speaker setup using the EVZLX 12P speakers with a Yamaha DXS12 powered subwoofer and the sound just blows you away.  I set the DSP on the EVZLX 12Ps to Mode = Live, Location = Pole, Treble = 0, Bass = 0, Sub = 120kz, and left all the other DSP settings at default.  The volume control on input 1 on both speakers was set to the 2 o'clock position.  The sound was fantastic.  I strongly recommend that if you are looking for a great powered PA speaker that has a excellent price compared to other speakers of the same quality, such as the QSC K12s for example, do yourself a favor get the EV ZLX 12Ps they really kick and are super clear with an incredible bass response at loud volumes.
