Pretty piece of hardware. Just what I wanted. I just started playing a month ago and am progressing rapidly. Therefore I wanted more than just my 2 toms so I got a nice pearl rack Tom. But no place to mount it! With this I have it right with the other two toms and I even used the third clamp for my splash! AWSOME PRODUCT A MUST HAVE
