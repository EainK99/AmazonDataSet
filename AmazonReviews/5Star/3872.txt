I purchased these for my KRK KNS 8400 and they're pretty great. Obviously they have a volume slider but it also adds some good length if you own the 1.5m (3 feet) cable (which is the standard length). All in all the build quality is great and the twist-to-lock mechanism is pretty fantastic too so it won't just fly out of the headphones input jack.
