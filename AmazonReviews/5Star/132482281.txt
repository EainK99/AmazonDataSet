Love this whistle, the tone is pure but without a metallicness that I hear in my Feadog.  I own a Clark D, a Clark D Sweetone and a Feadog C.  The Clarks sound great but are a little breathy, and the Feadog is pure but has a &#34;ring&#34; to it that I don't like, especially in the lower octave.  This whistle, is just perfect, and sounds like a much more expensive whistle to my ear.  The pitch can be adjusted by sliding the mouthpiece, and it was simple to get it to concert pitch.  My electronic tuner shows it to be 90-95% in tune, which is perfect -- I think slight variations give it character.<br /><br />Because this is an F whistle, the top few notes (such as C+, D+, E+, F++) in the upper octive do sound a bit shrill, but I think that is going to happen with any high-F whistle.<br /><br />I may have to get myself a Freeman tweaked D after hearing how great this one sounds.<br /><br />ps. if you want to play the irish whistle solo in &#34;You Can Call Me Al&#34; this is the whistle you need
