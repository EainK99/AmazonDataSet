Item came with a 9v battery and headphones in addition to the amp itself. It was packaged professionally and worked straight out of the box.<br /><br />PROS :<br /><br />Cheap<br />Came with batteries and headphones<br />Has distortion setting<br />Sounds great through headphones in clean and distortion mode<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br /><br />It has a DC power in, and a MP3 player jack. I haven't used either, so I am considering these \\"neutral\\" features. I can see using the DC jack in a pinch but it sort of defeats the purpose of this portable little amp.<br /><br />Speaker is a bit weak, however it actually doesn't sound half-bad. It's pretty good for practicing, and I expected that it wasn't supposed to be used for entertaining someone.<br /><br />CONS :<br /><br />The form factor of the device is a bit odd, it gets in the way if you have a guitar with a amp jack on the top of it like a strat or p-bass. If your jack is on the side of your guitar there are no problems.<br /><br />FINAL :<br /><br />I am leaving a 5 star review because this amp is basically perfect for practicing. I am actually very impressed with it's quality considering it only costs 12 dollars. It's also versatile. You can use it with or without headphones, and it has a distortion switch if you want to noodle around with heavier music. If you have a guitar that has a jack on the side of the body, and are looking for a practice amp I don't see any reason to purchase anything else.<br /><br />I ultimately decided to purchase this unit over an Electro Harmonix or any other option because it was so cheap. Though I could afford something better, I figured I'd take a chance on this since it had a distortion mode and could be used with headphones or the built in speaker. After looking at other Joyo product reviews I decided to pull the trigger and I wasn't disappointed. Now that I have an example of the good quality of their work I am actually looking into trying out a few of their other products like theireffect pedals. I can't believe they have such cheap products, and that the one I randomly took a chance on was this good.
