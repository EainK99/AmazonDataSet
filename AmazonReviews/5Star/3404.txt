I checked around for cases... this was a good price and met my requirements as far as my storage/protection needs. I am a casual guitarist, not in a band, so don't travel much with instruments. However, the case seems very sturdy, it locks, and if I wanted to fly to the west coast and pack it along, I would not hesitate to do so. It compared very closely with what I could find from Musician's Friend (very trusted site for my needs), in terms of construction and pricing.
