After trying different types of capos over many years of guitar playing, I think the Shubb design is the best.  It's simple, adjustable, easy to put on/take off and stays out of the way.  Shubbs apply just the right pressure consistently across all strings.  The materials are right for the job, and they last.  I've lost a few Shubb capos over the years, but I've never had one break, warp, wear or rust.
