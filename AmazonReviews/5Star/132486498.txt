My son, who is a fairly accomplished high school musician, switches between this mouthpiece and a metal jazz mouthpiece. He loves both; he says this one is easier to play and because it is \\"rubber\\" gives good deep tones (he uses it more for marching and concert band, and uses the metal mouthpiece for jazz band, as it has a brighter tone).  His band teacher and also his private teacher, who both play with many groups locally, also use this mouthpiece as one of their options, and both suggested it.
