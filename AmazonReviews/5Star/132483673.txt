Our church has eight of these and we recently had a Christian Hip Hop concert and the artists were still able to hear themselves over the 16,000 watt RMS sound system with 4 EAW KF 650Z mains and 4 SB 1000z subwoofers. I have driven them with a Crown CE 1000, XLS 602,and XTi 2000 without any problems so far and we have never blown any of them yet even though we play them at very high levels at times.
