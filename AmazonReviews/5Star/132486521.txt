Gave up my '71 American Strat almost 40 years ago for reasons that I won't go into here. I finally decided to scratch the itch and pick up a guitar again. The one thing I knew was that my new guitar had to be a Stratocaster, no other guitar feels like a Strat.<br />Yes, this one is made in Mexico, but when I picked it up & strapped it on, it's a Stratocaster. The neck, the weight & balance are perfect. This guitar plays like a dream. The addition of the Pearly Gates Humbucker & the two Texas special pickups make this guitar more versatile & it sounds even better than my long lost American Strat for thousands of dollars less.<br />It arrived set up & ready to go right out of the box.<br />I feel like I found the one that got away & not only is she the way I remember her, she's better.
