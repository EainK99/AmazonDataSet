I needed an inexpensive unit to separately control the levels on headphones and monitors in my keyboard studio.  This unit is very compact and very inexpensive.  The only issue I had was when I connected one of the HA400's outputs to the 1/4&#34; inputs on my Mackie powered monitors using a stereo 1/4&#34; to a dual mono 1/4&#34; splitter cable, the sound was distorted.  However, when I switched to a stereo 1/4&#34; to dual RCA splitter cable and connected to the monitors' RCA inputs, the sound was clear. I am not sure why this is so, but for $20 I am not going to ask a lot of questions.
