Works good on my DW snare drum. reasonably priced compared to other inventions that can possibly damage your drum or just plain cant hold on. I added a white, thin, shop towel fragment under the clip (and on the drum head) to add a little additional muffling. One may possibly want 2 of these on a snare, depending on their preference
