We have a mobile sound company that does a variety of types of live sound and recording gigs in places ranging from bars to large theaters to the occasional outdoor event.  We probably average about 4-5 gigs per week so the cables see a lot of action.  I've been using the GLS XLR cables for about 2 years now (we have about 60-80) and hands-down they can't be beat for price/performance.  Good quality and serviceable ends - these are real price performers!
