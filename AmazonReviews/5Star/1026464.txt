For a lower priced condenser, this mic is impressive. Pretty flat response with a bump at about 10k makes this a versatile choice for vocals and instruments. Used it as a VO mic so far and am very happy with it. Sounds even better when matched with a tube preamp. Very sturdy spider mount. This stands up to many expensive high end mics that I've used over the years. Pretty steep high pass; I've bumped mixer eq at around 150H to compensate, but that's a minor quibble.
