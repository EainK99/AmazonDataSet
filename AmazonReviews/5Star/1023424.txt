These get a lot of mixed reviews, but I really like them.  I use them on a P Bass with Kent Armstrong pickups, and it sounds great.  They're easy to play, feel great, and have great tone.  Lots of thump, not much in the way of brightness.  In terms of feel, they're about half way between round and flat wounds.  In terms of tone, they're closer to flat wounds than round wounds.  I will continue to use these in the future.
