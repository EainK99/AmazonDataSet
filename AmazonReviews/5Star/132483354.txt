Just to be clear, I've never owned a professional pair of headphones before. I've used them in the past, but in very loud noise environments as a sound engineer.<br /><br />These headphones are fantastic, especially for the $60 pricetag I got them for. Their acoustic balance is slightly more bass-heavy than I'm used to, and that's definitely a plus. No tinny sound whatsoever. Listening to various music (daft punk, folk music) I have to say that this is a great pair of headphones for any genre.<br /><br />Headphones are very comfortable on the head, fully cup around the ears, but my ears don't touch the drivers. Although, this makes them a bit hot on the ears, since they're not open-backed headphones. The cable is very long, even if I have to reach and grab something partly across the room. They arrived in great condition, no inner packaging damage at all.<br /><br />If you're not an extreme audiophile and are on a budget, I'd recommend getting these if you ever listen with headphones.
