Had this thing for several years now, it is holding up great. Action was set right out of the box. Just tune it and go.<br /><br />I use a clamp-on digital tuner (Snark?), which responds super well on this guitar. Anyway, it stays in tune really well for a guitar at this price point.<br /><br />Finish is holding up really well; it has taken a couple good blows without leaving any marks. I was concerned about the pointy edges wearing out, but after several years, no visible wear.
