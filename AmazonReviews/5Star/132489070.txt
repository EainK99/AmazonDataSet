I am always a bit reluctant to buy online, but this thing really did the trick. I'm all set up to record with just a mic,XLR cable, the icicle and a laptop! The quality came out better than using a professional soundboard into my mic line into laptop. Highly recommend this for anyone who wants to record on the go and get great quality at the same time. :)
