I've spoken with others who have used this boxes' predecessors that require an elaborate setup. This is so easy! You play the chords that will comprise your music, sing the parts you want harmony on, and listen if the parts create the sound you want. If you like it, remember it. If not, switch to one of the other seven preset harmonizing parts and see which one works best. While I don't perform professionally, I realize you need to use this device for accent ... not all the time. It becomes a gimmick if not used judiciously. Having said that, and choosing the first option (full counter clockwise ... or about 7 o'clock position), and singing &#34;Tumbling Tumbleweeds,&#34; I became the Sons of the Pioneers. I could not believe how the Harmony Singer followed my voice. The built in reverb is convenient as well. I have nothing but praise for the Harmony Singer and the price makes it accessible for both the professional and the amateur.
