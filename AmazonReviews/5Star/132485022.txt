I like almost everything about this stool ... I'm a little on the tall side and most music store staple offerings just are not high enough ... now I can get a stool with a height that suits me which can be adjusted with ease for various applications or when someone else with different physical features wants to use it ... it travels well and is built solid enough to take the rigors of gigging ... the seat is very comfortable:  thick padding / size and shape that contours well ... as I said, it appears to be one of the best choices out there for musicians who need comfort, portability, adjustability and durability ...<br /><br />*I have only one negative:  The foot rest, while adjustable, it is not a quick change like the seat height.  You'll want to find a good setting and leave it there.  If the adjustment for the footrest were enhanced to be as easy as the seat, this would be as perfect a stool as could be found, in my opinion.<br /><br />Note:  The price is high so if you just need something to sit on without being concerned with the features this stool offers, then save your money.  However, if you have been constantly unsatisfied with cheaper offerings out there, like I have, either due to the lack of adjustability or questionable durability, then cut your losses and end your search here ... as I said, very close to perfect for an active musician ...
