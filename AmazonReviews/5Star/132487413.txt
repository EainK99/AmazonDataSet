This is the best 48&#34; blacklight for the money. I had a 40w T-12 bulb that I couldn't find a fixture for. It fits and works perfect. (This does come with a bulb, so I have an extra.) The light intensity is not as bright as my 18&#34; fixture, but the size more than makes up for that. Has on/off switch, and mounting holes/screws. Packaging was good too, and it arrived undamaged.
