Bought this for its portability. I'm no didge master by any means, but this little guy sounds pretty good to me. It has a relatively small mouth opening, so you really have to be sure to not over blow. Use a light touch but this baby can put out some really nice sounds. Happy I bought it, hope you will be, too.
