With these strings, the resonance sounds clear and the life lasts longer than comparable priced strings on my violin. I'd prefer a little less tension but the feel on the fingers isn't too bad. I've tried many different strings and am still experimenting but so far I like these the best on my violin but obviously YMMV since the violin itself is a huge factor on the sound.
