We use it with an EV powered system for attaching top speaker to sub cab. It frees up a pair of tripod stands for other usage. Fits perfectly. We just put them in a tripod bag along with a tripod pair. Do wish we had a separate bag to minimize scratches and dings. Very solid and durable. Well made. So far no complaints. Tom P
