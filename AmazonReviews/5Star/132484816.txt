I was tired of squinting at my piano music despite overhead lighting and a nearby floor lamp, and was finally inspired to look for something like this by the gig light that my son uses for his saxophone music. This light perfectly illuminates two (or three) pages of music, clips securely to the stand on my grand piano, and can run on either batteries or a 110 outlet. When my piano instructor saw it, she immediately ordered one for her studio, and now I think all her adult students have one! I don't even turn the floor lamp on anymore - this is plenty of gentle but bright light. Love it!!
