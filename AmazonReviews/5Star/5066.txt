I have finally found the Duncan that is &#34;my sound&#34;!! I stumbled onto these TB-11 Custom Custom pickups when I bought an ESP/LTD ELITE ST-1 with a Duncan TB-5 at the bridge. My ears told me that with the alder body and the maple board and the Floyd Trem, the TB-5 was a bit shrill and had a really sharp, pointy top end. I liked the output so I did some research and found out that the TB-11 (Custom Custom) was the same pickup as the TB-5 but with Alnico II magnets. I ordered it and when it came in I installed it onto the guitar and it's been there ever since! I'll never take this pickup out of this guitar (unless I sell it) because it did exactly what I expected it to do. The high end is now very sweet and creamy, the mids are clear and not muddy/fuddy/thudy. The bottom end can be a little overpowering at times but that can be adjusted with the height screws or with the bass adjustment on the amp/dirt pedal. I was a dedicated JB (TB-4) user 'til I found this jewel! Now I have 6 JB's lying around the house!<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like the tone of a Duncan TB-4 JB or the TB-5 Duncan Custom, and want a tick more output, and want the top smoother with some added bottom, this is your pickup!! If you buy one you'll buy more....
