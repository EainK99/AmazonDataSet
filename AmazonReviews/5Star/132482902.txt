Up front: this is a value-priced package of the [[ASIN:B005OBV8JW PowerWerks Single 12 inch Powered Sub PW112S]] and [[ASIN:B005DSSZHO Powerwerks PW100T All-In-One PA System]] with a mounting pole and rebranded with the Harbinger logo. There is nothing wrong with that because the PowerWerks gear is rock solid and this bundle is priced significantly less than purchasing the components individually.<br /><br />The sub is a little bulky and definitely heavy, but it puts out surprisingly deep low end. In my practice room we run a bass guitar through it via the PA head and it sounds like a small bass amp. The the frequency response curve is 35 to 150Hz. The input is 1/4\\" and line-level unbalanced only and is designed to work with the sub output of the PW100T. You cannot run the output of a power amp into this. Also, there is a 1/4\\" output jack that is really a pass-through to another sub, and it is also a line-level signal.<br /><br />About the PW100T: On the back there are two 1 1/4\\" inputs for guitars, keys, bass, etc. There are also two XLR inputs for mics or even the output from a small unpowered mixer. Those also provide phantom power. The inputs are not either/or. You can use all four simultaneously. The drawback is the instruments sharing each of the two main channels cannot be individually EQ'd. there is a third channel with a 1/8\\" jack that is perfect for MP3 players or other backing track devices if you are using this as a solo act.<br /><br />Another feature is the PowerLink circuit that allows you to daisychain a number of these to literally fill a room. You connect them via XLR cables. They are really pass-throughs that will provide a line-level feed of your channel mixes, but before they are processed through the master volume. This ensures that the levels are individual for each channel instead of summed when they are sent to the other unit. You can also connect a powered monitor to the out port.<br /><br />Although this has no effects loop or built-in FX, you can add reverb via a guitar pedal in the signal chain.<br /><br />The  bottom line is this is perfect for small groups or venues and is easy to transport and set up. because you can daisy-chain the components a pair of these gives you room to scale up. One final note: you can also connect powered monitors to the X-link ports, giving you even more flexibility.you can add reverb via a guitar pedal in the signal chain.<br /><br />The  bottom line is this is perfect for small groups or venues and is easy to transport and set up. because you can daisy-chain the components a pair of these gives you room to scale up.
