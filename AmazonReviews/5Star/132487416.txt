This case is very well constructed.  When I turn the case upside down, and all directions, the bass barely moves at all inside.  The 4 latches are a much better design than the 3 latch model produced by other companies.  I stumbled onto mine on Craigslist and was able to clean it up very easily with Armor All.  The case also is very well balanced and has nice feet on it, stands up on its own very nicely.  Rugged and as expected, a little on the heavy side.  But not terribly so.
