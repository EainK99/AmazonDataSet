I have this guitar and enjoy it very much. I bought it very lightly used on Ebay for $300 Shipped. It weighs under 6 pounds and my back thanks me! It plays great and it intonates perfectly. All chords ring out true and in tune. The pickups are actually very decent but I did upgrade the bridge pickup to the Dimarzio Transition. The balance is perfect for me in either a seated or standing position.<br /><br />Even with the stock pickups you can get a wide variety of tones all of which are very usable.You could feel at home playing anything from Country,Jazz,or any variety of Rock on this model. The neck is very thin so if you have small hands, as I do, then this is a blessing. If your hands are large then this might not work for you. For me, the neck plays awesome.The tremolo is the best Non Floyd Rose I've ever played. The pitch goes down only and not up and the guitar stays in a relatively good tuning after fairly heavy usage which is almost impossible on standard non locking tremolos.The Sperzel Locking Tuners are a joy and you can change strings and be tuned up in 5 minutes tops.<br /><br />I liked this guitar so much I bought the same version that came with a factory installed Floyd Rose. This guitar is also great but I think they should've given this guitar it's own Model # as the two are not identical in neck, body and weight. The neck is a fuller shape, probably to accommodate the locking nut.The body is slightly thicker although it is basically the same shape. The guitar is a little bit heavier by maybe 1 and a half pounds. The general tone of this guitar is a little bit louder probably due to the slightly larger mass and the Floyd Rose. Both Guitars are excellent, especially considering they are made in Indonesia. I would not hesitate in buying another Parker Guitar.<br />I own 20 guitars and these guitars currently get the most play.
