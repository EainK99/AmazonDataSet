If you have been playing on a 7c this is an easy transition. I play<br />Mellophone needed a mouthpiece that would work better with my braces,<br />and this one helped alot. although, it increases confort and range,<br />it has bad tone, and reduces your volume. It has has a empty sound,<br />rather than a deep robust sound you would get from a mellophone<br />mouthpiece.
