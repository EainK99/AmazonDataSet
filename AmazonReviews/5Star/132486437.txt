Really, I can't imagine a better, more convenient light.  It is the perfect accessary for the gigging musician.  And, as a bonus I have used it many times while packing up in a dark area....even had a blackout during the gig and found all my stuff to pack up and light the pathway to my car.....oh, and a superior light for reading charts. .
