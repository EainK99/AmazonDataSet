With this particular strap I ultimately believe that my instrument is securely repaired and I've no more concerns that something might occur to my ukulele, which I purchased many years ago while vacationing in Hawaii. I love the fact it's also a completely adjustable strap. Excellent quality for the cost.**This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes.
