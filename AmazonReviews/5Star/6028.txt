Setup my new PPI 900.4 Phantom Series amp with ease!  I was able to find out my maximum volume without distortion on my new Pioneer AVH-4100 NEX..goes all the way to 60 Max volume and doesn't distort!  Set the gains and +3db overlap on my mid range speakers easily and accurately.  Love the digital readout.  So much easier to set exact overlap.  Thank you Steve Meade for such a great product.  I would love to have a Demo in your 30,000 watt Tahoe some day:)
