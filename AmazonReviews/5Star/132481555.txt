This is a well padded uke case. Exactly what I was looking for. Attractive, super light, offers the ukulele lots of protection AND at a great price!! I shopped around a bit. There are a lot cases that cost twice as much, and many of them are pretty goofy. Glad I gave this one a try! Many thanks to those who gave positive customer reviews.<br /><br />Package arrived early on the delivery date, and I was so glad. It allowed plenty of time for birthday wrapping!!<br /><br />Very happy with the product and the seller.<br /><br />Only question: I don't see the same type of case for tenor ukulele. Would love to get one.
