I put these lights in my finished basement. I have a drop ceiling so I just added a strip of crown molding and laid these lights in it.They are simple to roll out and plug in. There's a remote with them that allows you to change colors, fade, strobe etc. My kids love it downstairs! When I turn off the regular lights and only have these on, it looks like a neon bar atmosphere! I've had several people ask me where to get them now . Just make sure you measure how long you need. This is your 1st purchase, then you can add additional strips to connect .Love them!
