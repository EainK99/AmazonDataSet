This is a very high quality 12' extension cord for your headphones or ear phones.  It is probably best for sitting on your couch with your headphones and using the 12' extension cord to connect to your TV/ DVD player or CD player/ stereo. That's what I use it for and it's great.  Snaps easily and properly into your phono socket on one end and your headphone correcting cord on the other end.  Well done.
