I consider myself fortunate, because unlike some other reviewer's.  It took 2 years for this amp to truly crap out on me.<br /><br />I first purchased the MB115 from Musicians Friend interested in producing a large amount of sound to fill out my rock band.  About a month later, the MB115 produced a very \\"crackly\\" sound at about 50% volume (similar to other users) so I returned it to MF, exchanged for the MB212 and payed the difference (~$200 at the time).  MF indicated that was the final exchange they could do for me so I considered my options and figured I would be stuck with the MB212.  Fine.<br /><br />The MB212 lasted me for 6 months before it did the same thing as the MB115.  GK has a 2 year repair warranty, but you have to take it to a GK certified repair center.  The nearest repair center to me was 130 miles away, but I frequently traveled that way anyway so it wasn't too bad.  Needless to say, I took it to the repair shop 3 times over two years and now the amp is out of warranty and the same problem happened again.  This time I took it to a better shop and they said:  \\"All we can do is continue soldering this connection, but it is going to fail again, the motherboard is going to continue to fry this fitting over and over again.  You should get a new amp, or convert this to a cabinet.\\"<br /><br />So I think I will use the cab, and get a head from another manufacturer.<br /><br />Is this truly a problem with GK? Or is it a problem with the repair shop I went to?  I will never be certain, but I would've never had to take it to a repair shop if it weren't a problem with GK.
