Sound is really muffled for high-tension strings. They don't stay in tune long. I've bought these before from stores and never had such a terrible experience. These just sound like they've been microwaved.<br /><br />I'm guessing that since the time Segovia gave them the accolade (proudly printed on the back of the package) the quality hasn't been the same. I would've been better off playing the worn set I'd replaced with these.
