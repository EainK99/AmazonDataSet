Worked great when I first bought it. Nice and bright. Power converter is an ugly color. Can't imagine anyone that wants baby blue in their PC case. Velcro doesn't stick for more than a few minutes. I used Electrical tape instead, making sure I didn't cover the holes on the box. One week later and one of the lights went out. I took it out of the case and noticed a bit of a crack on the exterior and the  internal piece was in two pieces. Don't waste your money, get better quality.
