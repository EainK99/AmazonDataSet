I am an mobile DJ and I was looking to add wireless to my setup, this wireless sytems was the cheapest UHF system I could find. I have some luck with Pyle products, their 15&#34; subwoofers work fine for me in my setup and their easy on my back. I have used other (instrument) wirelss systems as a guitarist so I know that UHF is the way to go with wireless systems. Long story short, as soon as this sytem arrived I plugged it in (which was very simple), tested one microphone and walked 15 feet away from the system doing the &#34;mic check 1,2&#34; and the system cut out. The quality was clear however on the first one. Second microphone, not so clear, and their manual adjustments didn't help much. Same issue, walked 15 feet away and cut out. Put them in the box and returned them within two hours of getting them (I paused to have lunch and shrug it off), then brough them down to UPS with a return label. Thankfully Amazon has an awesome return policy, 5 Stars for Amazon, 1 star for this product. Gonna buy the GTD Audio G-622H listed on Amazon and I will update this review once I try them out. Its more $, but will likely be worth it based on its reviews.
