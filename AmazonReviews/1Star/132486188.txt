I purchased this item it took around a month for delivery and when they arrived I tried to replace the covers on an ibanez artist I removed the old covers cut when I went to install these three of the pole screws wouldn't line up so I put the original covers back on I tried to line them up on a different guitar same problem I tried them on some loose humbuckers same thing I would send them back but the return shipping would most likely as much as the covers cost so might as well keep them I'm not sure what  exactly these things are suppose to fit
