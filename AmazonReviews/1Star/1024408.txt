Please note that this flute is not related to the Bundy flutes from the past. It's not even made by the same company. I repair flutes for a living. I just worked on my first Bundy flute and it may be my last. Many pads were torn from sharp edges on the instrument. In the end the flute was not worth the time and materials I put in to getting it to play. The best flute for the money may be one made by Jupiter. I don't know of a less expensive one that will play well and last.
