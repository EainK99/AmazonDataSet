I don't understand how this got so many positive reviews... it's unusable.  It's motion is caused by an incline but once it starts going gravity makes it move so fast I have to hold onto the bars not to fly off of it.  Every step makes it go faster, there's no way to just got for a steady run.  I tried propping it up a bit so the incline wasn't so steep and it just didn't move.  When I did get it to move enough to at least walk, it kept randomly stopping and tripping me.  My boyfriend tried it too and flew off of it too after about 10 seconds.<br /><br />I honestly think this product is garbage... I'll be investing in something better designed.
