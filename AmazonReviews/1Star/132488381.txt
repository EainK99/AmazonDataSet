The clip used to attach the sax is plastic and broke the first time my high school age son used it in marching band practice.  I returned the item immediately to Amazon and bought another brand that had a metal clip which has been much better.  The straps were comfortable but the plastic clip is doomed to break by the weight of the saxophone.
