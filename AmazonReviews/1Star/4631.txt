This thing gave me trouble since day one. Does it work? Sure, kinda, but you have to wrestle with the thing to make it stay anywhere. Like, literally anywhere. The inner metal within the support rod is low quality and doesn't hold position no matter where you put it.<br /><br />Don't let the cheap price fool you. I implore you to spend LITERALLY just a few more bucks to get one that works (I'm using a $20 Auphonix now, and it's great!)
