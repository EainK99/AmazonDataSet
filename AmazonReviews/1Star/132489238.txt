I bought one of these puppies a couple of years ago, and have had nothing but problems with it--the audio cuts out after my computer wakes from \\"sleep\\" mode.<br /><br />They upgraded the hardware chipset because of flaws, and when I contacted support they tried to claim \\"sleep\\" mode wasn't supported by any audio interface. Funny enough, when I replaced my Saffire 6 with an Apogee Duet the problem went away.<br /><br />Focusrite is cheaper than their competitors...in every way--you truly get what you pay for. I'd look at Motu, Apogee or RME instead.
