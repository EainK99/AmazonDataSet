I'm a DJ using a macbook pro.  Was really excited when I saw mydmx 2 was mac compatible. Yeah not really. many of the features that are available for mydmx are NOT available for the mac.  You have to go to ADJ to request fixture profiles instead of making them yourself as you can on PC.  Also have issues with the MAC seeing the interface.  May want to go to Chauvet or Blizzard instead if your using a MAC.[[ASIN:B007X7DN5M American DJ Supply MY DMX 2.0 Special Effects Lighting and Equipment]]
