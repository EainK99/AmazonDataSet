I am telling you. Do not get this mic. It sounds amazing and has tons of features. BUT! It breaks withing a month. And you repeatly have to by new stuff for it to fix it. I sold it and got the Audio Technica AT2020 it took me over 3 weeks just to return the Blue Yeti and get the Audio Technica. I got the Plus version of the Audio Technica!
