The frets were not placed at the correct places and it's impossible to tune it. I'm a professional guitarist and bought this guitar for my little grandson. After receiving it I was totally ticked off that they would sell such a terrible guitar that is useless. Don't waste your money. Go to a guitar shop and play one before you buy it.
