I read that many folks had bad luck with this item and figured it wouldn't happen to me.  Not so!  Mine would not work  put of the box and I think it was due to the cheap electronics that comes with the kit and not the LEDs themselves.<br />Anyway, my daughter, who works in the lighting business warned me they were too cheap to be of any quality and she proved right. Fortunately these were shipped by Amazon and so a return was not a problem.
