I bought this kit primarily for the tuning lever- from the description and pictures it seemed to be of better quality than many of it's similarly priced competitors.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that is the case.  The eight point head fits only very loosely on the tuning pins- it's not a secure or positive fit at all. It's sloppy, and it probably is doing damage to the pins themselves- it's exerting torque on the edges of the pins, not the flat sides of the pins.  I have a rebuilt Mason & Hamlin AA with brand new  #2 pins with no wear on them at all, so I know the problem is the tool, not the pins themselves. How tough could it be to make a tool that actually correctly fits the pin?  This one is off by somewhere between .5 and 1 mm- but it feels more like a mile. This tuning lever fits far worse than the crappy and worn tuning lever I have from the 1970's- but I doubt that one was made in China.  This one will be going home to China, I just printed the return label.
