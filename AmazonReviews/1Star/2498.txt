The products came shipped in a shoddy cardboard box with a few pieces of newspaper thrown in for insulation (not nearly enough to protect such a delicate piece of machinery). The wire was already plugged into the interface and the CD case was placed on top of it. I needed to re-install the drivers even though I already owned and used this same exact interface with my rig before in order for it to work. After a while, I started to notice an extremely high pitched noise emanating from the device.  I am positive that the noise is coming from the device and not something else because it is only audible when the device is plugged into my computer.  I tried different wires, re-installing the drivers again to no avail. The noise is extremely annoying and makes producing a headache, I can't stand to be in my studio with it running for more than a few minutes before I start to contemplate suicide.
