I was looking for an inexpensive, but decent quality violin to start my nine-year old daughter off for school orchestra.  After researching many options on the internet, I thought this might be a great violin to get her started before she out grew the 1/2 size violin.  However, this is NOT the one!!!  Immediately after unpacking the violin I could tell this was not a decent quality violin, base on the flimsiness of the string.  In fact, the E-string peg was completely displaced on the left side make the string completely lose.  After repositioning the E string and peg, I attempted to tune using the provided tuner.  As I tighten the string through the progression of the notes (i.e. low to high) once I got it on the boarderline of A and E thought I was going to be ok, but then snap the string broke.  I've owned several inexpensive guitars with flimsiness string and never had this kind of problem attempting the tune.  At this point, I immediately pack the violin back up to return.  I would not recommend this product.
