I am a middle school band director and a professional trumpet player.  This is garbage, DO NOT BUY IT.  I make all parents return these.  It will break and no shop will repair it.  Your child will sound worse than other students on quality instruments, get frustrated, and quit band.  You get what you pay for. An instrument needs to cost a few hundred dollars at a minimum, go to a music store NOT AMAZON.  Most stores will rent a quality instrument to you.
