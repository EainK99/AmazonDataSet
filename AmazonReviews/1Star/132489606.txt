I really loved the way this guitar wax made my guitar look. Unfortunately, after a few applications, I noticed the screws holding in my pickups had rusted after accidentally covering them with wax. I wasn't sure that it was the wax until I applied it to my bass and had the same thing happen to two of the screws on it. The knobs on my guitar have also rusted a bit from exposure to the wax.<br /><br />Overall, I would NOT recommend this to ANYONE. I love my instruments and take pride in the way the look, and now they're all funked up because Gerlitz made a crap product.
