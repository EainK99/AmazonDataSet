This is a poor quality instrument. I've been teaching beginning band since 1981 and I've learned that when it comes to \\"deals\\" like this, you get what you pay for and it's cheap. I've had students bring these in and they invariably have problems within the first two months. Then it's hard to get repaired because the instrument does not use the standard parts from any reputable instrument repair shop.
