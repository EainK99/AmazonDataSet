This is horrible..<br />seriously. First of all the sound cap fell off<br />had to glue it my self<br />then the switches are horrible quality<br />and worst of all<br />there is a very annoying white noise in the background<br />I can actually hear a fuzzing sound<br />this is bad....<br />I got it serviced and they told me the mic had no problem<br />and the problem was coming from my end<br />I got a TLM 103 and Shure Beta 87a<br />and I have no problems with this mic<br />We'll see how avantone will service....<br />140.. I expected something better
