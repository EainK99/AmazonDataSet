The unit is overall really good quality, does a great job for what it is. I've been using it for the past couple months to record & playback of voice and guitar. I don't notice any added noise while using my studio monitor headphones. The gain sounds clean, I haven't had any problems with over-modulation. The 2 track is great, and lets me actually use this as a 2 directional device (Playback, and recording without actually moving around cables.) It's been a big help patching everything up to my computer.<br /><br />My only gripe about the product, and it's a pretty serious gripe is the power connection is junk. It's a proprietary connector that looks like an S-Video connector, a very poor design. The plug doesn't stay in place, it'll slip in but it wiggles around and disconnects easy. The slightest movement to the mixer will cause the power to cut and surge. It causes random surges through my audio connections making speakers pop and affecting sound quality and ruining recordings. This could damage expensive audio gear, costing you many times what this device is worth. The connector is a serious flaw, I'd consider the product defective there needs to be a recall. If you do buy it, be very very careful around the power plug. May god help you if you have a cat.
