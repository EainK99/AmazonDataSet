I bought these thinking they would be fairly good but I threw them away immediately.  The \\"fit and finish\\" was terrible, and they just looked cheap and shabby.  Stick to the well known tuner makers like Schaller, Grover, Gotoh, etc.  The Chinese companies copy good products but they take all kinds of shortcuts in materials and craftsmanship.
