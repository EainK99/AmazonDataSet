I purchased this product with the full knowledge I had to open and correct any mistakes in its assembly; this turned out to be very true. The mechanical part of this product is as expected and provided me with the basics for making a good switch. The wiring inside is &#34;not good&#34;: The power cord is #18 AWG which is only suitable for 10A on its best day, the thermal circuit breaker in the unit is 15A, so the cord will melt first. Internally all the connections are made with un-insulated solid copper wire, which may also just about handle 10A on a good day. The connections are all soldered and properly in the case of the unit I received. The biggest problem is that all the switch are switching while properly switching the hot circuit are then all connected to the Neutral of the output sockets, thus reversing the Hot/Neutral on ALL 8 outputs.<br />Once I a) Change the cord to a 15A one, b) replace all the internal wiring, c) insulate all connections. Then this will be a good working product that I will be safe using.<br />If like me you are willing to put in the work to make this product safe then I can recommend buying this as its still cheaper than building it from scratch (unless you have all the metal cutting and folding equipment to hand)<br />NOTE: The complete lack of any UL certification on the strip is the 100% give away that this is going to be bad.
