First of all your price for this ibanez is way to high.I used to own this guitar and I paid maybe 450 for it .I did add a few things to it,like adding a couple demarzio pickups and a few other odds and ends.Are you as high as this price or is there something special aboot this guitar.I don't think soo because it is the same guitar I used to own,<br /> only 4 or five times the price.
