This thing felt cheap as soon as I opened it. I own several epiphones and thy are great guitars. This guitar does not feel like an epiphone. It feels like it is a toy. The finish is cheap looking, the tuning pegs are awful and they are not installed properly.  The head stock has mismatching parts that looks like they were added after market by someone who needs glasses. Nothing is properly aligned on this guitar.<br /><br />The guitar does not stay in tune AT ALL.  So you are constantly tuning it. The first time I played it, I had to tune the strings up a great deal to get the guitar in tune. The tension seems a bit high and as I was expressing my concern the wooden bridge snapped (within 1-2 minutes of tuning). I had only tuned the guitar to Eb because I was already concerned the tension was to much at a half step down so I didn't want to push my luck trying to get it to standard tuning.<br /><br />So this guitar is a waste of money and is completely useless.<br /><br />I contacted the seller Music 123 and they seemed completely un-phased by my experience. They sent me a form response saying I can ship the guitar back to them at my own expense with the original packaging that I obviously don't have and then pay them a fee to get a refund.<br /><br />Basically refusing to refund me for this defective product. Total SCAM!!! Stay away!!!!
