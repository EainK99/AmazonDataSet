A pal and I each bought on on sale. I could not add a device in the 'chain' ad neither could he. So we talked it over with an amp geek and all around whiz as well as the SamAsh resident smart aleck. None of us could add an effect and repeat it let alone move it in the chain ('lift and drop'). And when I found out you can only have 1 chain at a time, what's the point if you play live?  We want a device to replace and amp and be able to select with footswitch among several combinations  (delay&#62;compress&#62;amp11  or  Chorus&#62;filter&#62; amp2). But you can't do it and the paper documentation is mediocre and incorrect about adding an effect. the website FAQ has 4 useless questions.  Look, when 2 college graduates cannot figure out the use of a stomp box effect and amp simulator... the dammm thing is poorly documented and programmed. Don't waste your time.
