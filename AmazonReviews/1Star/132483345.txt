When a company like Amazon, that builds a reputation for selling many products at the best price possible does something like this, I would hope it was an error...<br /><br />This is completely outrageous. The list price of $29 is for a 4 pack. Amazon sent me 1 string for $15+. Won't be ordering from Amazon again.<br /><br />Now they will charge up to $5+ for me to return the string...which could easily be put in an envelope for 50 cents...
