I have not even gotten this installed yet. I have spent the last half hour trying to get the battery cover back on. I am not an invalid. I am not a klutz. I do not have stubby fingers. I am a guitar player, an artist, and a techno-geek, and I will tell you right now: the battery cover on this device is an exercise in ridiculous and unnecessary frustration. It may be the very best shotgun mic in creation, but at this point I would never know that. If I ever get the cover on, I will update this review with my evaluation of its auditory performance, but for now, from an engineering standpoint, it gets 1 star; if I spend more than another half hour on trying to get the cover back on, I will return it.
