As many other reviewers said, cheap plastic mount was broken out of the box. Waiting for my replacement before testing sound and then I'll update my review. UPADATE: Replacement was in perfect condition leading me to believe I could have received a used/defective one the first time around. Regardless, I cannot seem to get over how cheap and easily breakable the plastic parts are. I've returned them both and purchased a Rode VideoMic GO which is well worth the extra bit of money for a MUCH better build quality. I didn't take the time to extensively compare sound between Rode and Tascam but can tell you based on a quick listen they are very similar.
