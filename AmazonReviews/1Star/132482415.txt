This is the first product that I am reviwing becasue the quality was so bad, I wanted other customer go with caution when buying this charinet. The damanaged case was so bad that the hand came off when I picked it up. The label came off easily. Overall the quality looks cheap. It look  like they send me used clarinet instead of brand new one.
