I received these items a few days ago. i ignored that it had some type of small whole padding where the earphones were at. but three days later these earphones have a shortage, i cant even hear the beat to my music, i barely hear the lyrics. this was a waste of my money! i am highly upset. if i wanted cheap earphones i could have went upstairs from my school and go to the dollar store. i wish i could get my money back. worst purchase i made on amazon ever!
