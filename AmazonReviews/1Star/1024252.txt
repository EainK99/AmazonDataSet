Do not buy unless you want a LONGPAI shoulder rest. The LONGPAI is an inferior product with cheap plastic parts that were already scratched up on arrival. I have a 1/4 size Everest shoulder rest here at home so I was able to compare the two and there's no way I'll put up with this one - it's going back first thing tomorrow morning.
