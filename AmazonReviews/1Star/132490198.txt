The major drawback for a lot of these instruments, is that they are very inexpensive upfront, but lack the quality of a good musical instrument.. Often times these instruments are known to music teachers as \\"throw away instruments\\" because music stores do not carry the parts to repair them if something goes wrong. ALL musical instruments need repair service at one time or another because musical instruments are an investment, like a car. Often times they do not tune properly, lack tone quality necessary for good ensemble playing, and are cheaply made. Yes, they look very nice and come in an assortment of colors, but I would save your money if I were you and purchase an instrument of a reputable brand.
