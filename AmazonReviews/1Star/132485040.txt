This violin is advertised for beginners but not even a beginner could use this. Sure the price is enticing but if you're serious about playing I'd suggest paying more for a better quality instrument.<br /><br />To start things off, the violin can't stay in tune. Once tuned it quickly goes out of tune in less than a few minutes. The black finish looks nice which is about the only good thing about this product.<br /><br />The quality of this violin is really poor but you get what you pay for.
