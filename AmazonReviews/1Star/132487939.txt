I have had this unit for almost 8 months. When I first got it it sounded great, then a speaker blew. Sent it in for repair in Las Vegas. Worked again for 2 Zumba sessions, then the other speaker blew, sent that in for repair, each time $40.00 in shipping. Got that speaker back played it for one Zumba session. Now the amp doesn't work nor do the speakers. I have tried again to get a hold of Behringer repair in Las Vegas but nobody answers anymore, email or phone. All I get is a recording and there support website is down.<br /><br />Recommendation.... DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!! if you do at your own risk, a big waste of money!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />Very pissed off customer.
