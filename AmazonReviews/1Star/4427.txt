Used this product to attach my camera to a monopod. The adapter sheered off at the base and my camera went crashing to the ground. Luckily quick reflexes and a strong strap kept it from smashing to bits. It looks like it is made from some kind of powdered metal. DO NOT ORDER this if you're planning on using it with anything of value.
