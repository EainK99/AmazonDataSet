Insanely overpriced imitation Kluson tuners (never that good to begin with) at a 500% markup under the excuse that they are &#34;Rickenbacker&#34;. You can get REAL Klusons for less and good imitations (like these) for $15-$20. The guy who inherited the Rickenbacker company is selling 50 year old designs at huge markups because his lawyers manage to block any imported copies since the 70's.
