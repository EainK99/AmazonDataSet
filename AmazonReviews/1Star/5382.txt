I will never buy an Ibanez anything ever again. Their product quality is questionable & their customer service is total crap. Bought one back in April '14 and it has been a pain ever since. A little background here first. I bought this for some light studio work and it has been minimally used. I have recorder 2 songs to date with this instrument so this is a literally new bass.<br /><br />Problem 1<br />I brought it home and within a week the jack kept cutting out. I brought it back to the place of purchase (GC) for warranty repair. The  tech proceeded to start replacing the jack on the spot which was great until he told me how much it would cost. Huh? It's a week old. 1 year parts warranty dude. He laughed and said well, I can send it back to Ibanez and have them fix it but it will cost 25+ buck to ship it to the repair center and it would take 2-4 weeks to get it back. He was going to hit me for 15 bucks in parts and 45.00 in labor. He said he couldn't fix it unless he submitted a claim ahead of time for approval if I didn't want to pay for the repair. Ibanez won't pay a claim after the fact. I told him to button it back up as I can easily fix it myself. I asked Ibanez about it first (I am an electronics tech with certifications and plenty qualified to do the work) and they never responded. Flat-out blow off. So for 10.00 I did it myself.<br /><br />Problem 2<br />3 months later I needed to adjust the neck. It was sitting for a while and the neck bowed severely. The weather changed and that is not unexpected although it was in need of a big adjustment that I thought was odd. The truss rod would not adjust. It was pretty stuck. I took it back to GC and had the tech take a look at it.  I didn't want to take the chance of breaking it. I thought I would leave that up to the tech. That way if it had to go back for repair it wouldn't be on my dime. Well, he got it loose but it was pretty touch and-go. We were both getting nervous. Turned out it had absolutely no tensionat all therefore the extreme bow. I spent 45.00 additional dollars to have the guy do a setup just to make sure it was all good.<br /><br />Problem 3<br />Battery consumption on this thing is ridiculous! If I didn't pull that batt cable when I wasn't going to use it for a week or two a brand new battery would be dead. I have an  ESP MH-1000 guitar with active pickups and the battery last forever.<br /><br />Problem 4<br />This is the worst of all and most shocking. In the middle of the night I hear a loud “ba-wang” in the room (bass is in my room on a stand) and really startled me. I get up and turn on the light and I see the D string hanging there. At 3 am I was like what? Did the string break? These are pretty new strings! Well, I went back to bed and then took a closer look and to my shock the string was completely intact.<br />Huh? How did the thing pop out of the bridge? Well I took a look at the bridge and almost **** myself!!!<br />The metal completely gave way/failed (see pics). The part where the string ball rests and the intonation screw reside had blown-out! So out of warranty I have to replace the bridge at my cost (70.00 bucks + shipping for the same lame bridge design or spend 88 bucks + shipping for the Accu-Cast bridge). In 35+ years of playing I have NEVER seen a bridge fail for any reason. This was absurd. I sent an email to Ibanez explaining that this is totally unacceptable regardless of the warranty period (which I probably violated when I changed the jack!). Well, guess what Ibanez had to say...”chirp..chirp...” not a thing. Nice. I had a power steering motor (155.00 part + labor) go out in a car (Chevy) 3,000 miles out of warranty and they replaced it at no cost to me under a courtesy warranty . That's customer service!<br /><br />So, the Accu-cast bridge is ordered (about 98.00 with shipping. 88.00 of which lands in Ibanez's pocket!) and will have to wait 3+ weeks for it. It was “in-stock” when I ordered it on line and a day later I get an email telling me that it's back ordered! What the...really! In the meantime I bought an ESP LTD B-5E 5-String Bass Guitar Satin Natural which is on it's way. I will get that before I get the bridge. The Ibanez will be promptly fixed and sold shortly thereafter. As for Ibanez, they can &#60;fill in the blanks _____ ___!&#62;.
