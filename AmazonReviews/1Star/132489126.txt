This is a great price for a trumphet. I guess the saying is true you get what you pay for. The trumphet looks great and has a nice carrying case. The problem we incurred was what many people had already stated which was about the keys. The first two keys worked perfectly but the third one kept getting stuck. I had my son have his band instructor check it out to see if maybe it just needed oil. The instructor advised me to send this trumphet back because to fix the key would cost more than the trumphet. To bad I was really hoping for a great product instead of disappointment and hassle to send it back.
