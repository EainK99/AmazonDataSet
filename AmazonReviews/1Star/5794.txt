After ordering these, the package I received contained 2R2L guitar tuners, not the bass tuners as pictured or described.  The zippered bag containing the tuners is labelled the same as the bass tuner listed here.  Requested an exchange for the bass tuners and received guitar tuners yet again.  For what it's worth, the guitar tuners received were badly damaged and would be unusable on a guitar.
