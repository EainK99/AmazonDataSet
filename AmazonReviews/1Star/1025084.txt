I didn't like the Modi 2 USB, there was noticeable noise induced by the USB connection to the computer. I ended up returning the Modi 2 USB and buying the Modi 2 Uber which is excellent (I'm using the optical connection to my MacBook Pro, no noise issues at all). That, coupled with my Schiit Valhalla and Senn HD600s, provides excellent audio quality.
