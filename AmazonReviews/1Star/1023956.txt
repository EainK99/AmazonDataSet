The ACD477 is the ideal product if you want a slightly more elaborate means of making your office smell like burnt plastic.  The next time I need to start a small fire using only poorly-constructed electronic devices, this is definitely my go-to.  At first I was concerned that it wouldn't get the chance to melt as the cheap interchangeable tips don't property stay in either the power supply or the device into which they're plugged, but then I realized that I have plenty of things I need to burn that don't move, so I attached the power supply to an external hard drive and gingerly set it down in such a way that gravity held the power tip in place.  In short, I love the Hosa ACD477 because I also love fire, especially when it's on my desk.
