I bought these lights to stick under my daughter's bunkbed. After installing it created a really beautiful and fun lighting under her bed. She really enjoyed selecting various colors. However after about 15 days of use ( which probably represent 4 hours on lighting on and off) the lights stopped working... I really like the idea, but they didn't last...
