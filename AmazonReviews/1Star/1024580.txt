Dissapointing. I am a beginner on the harp. My 1st harp was a Crossover in C. I got comfortable on it and on a Suzuki Bluesmaster C, my second purchase. The Rocket, in A, is too demanding on my breath in second position. Bending notes sound more like  Kazoo noise. Perhaps someday, I'll grow into it. Meanwhile, it's sidelined.
