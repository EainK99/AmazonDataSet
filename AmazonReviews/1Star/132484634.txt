These were the 600 LED \\"brighter\\" version, well I would hate to see the 300 version.  These would have been ideal to light up the bed of my truck.  Plugged them in and the entire roll doesn't come close to putting out enough light worth installing.  Might be good for accent lighting, but don't expect much output from these.  Model received was Hitlights SMD3528-LED/M
