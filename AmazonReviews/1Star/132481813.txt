I purchased this to go with a pair of my EV ELX115.  I ordered them to arrive about a week before a gig.  Unfortunately the first came damaged.  The top end of the stand was broken along with the mechanism used to tighten the stand.  I ordered a replacement that also arrived with the top end piece broken.  I did have to use it anyway to get through the gig, but returned both units shortly after.  I strongly suggest anyone considering this to look for something else.  I know I will be purchasing a different model.
