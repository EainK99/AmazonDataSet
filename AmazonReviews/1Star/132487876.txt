I purchased this to mount a series of vibra-slaps (along with the LP vibra-slap brackets). I was disappointed to find that the Rhythm Tech mount poles that come with this are slightly too large to fit in the holes in the PL brackets (the diameter is maybe 2mm too large). I assume that most other LP items will not fit, as well, although I haven't tried others yet.<br /><br />There is also a more fundamental problem than the issue of lacking universality.The knurled poles that come with this do not remain at the height you mount them at because the locking system is ineffective.<br /><br />The LP everything and mim-everything racks are much better buys, albeit more expensive. I find this Rythm Tech Quad Mount nearly useless.
