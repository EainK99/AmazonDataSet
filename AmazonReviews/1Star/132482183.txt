This thing is absolutely a waste of time and money! Got my unit, was super excited about it. Desk A's scratch function didn't work. Then the controller mode didn't work. Then it started glitching and different buttons were doing the wrong tasks. And then on top of that my unit has been in a non-stop load cycle and won't even turn on! It recognized my USB's about 30% of the time and when it did any slight touch to the unit as it was powering up and that's at least a day of non-use. What a piece of garbage. Awesome concept but terribly constructed. DO NOT BUY!!!!!
