I ordered this appearing microphone stand for my act next week. The price was average for tis item and well, I ordered.<br />It came quick!!  Just wait till you see what came in the box! First off, this thing wasn't in the original packaging. It was all<br />scratched up and warn looking, like it was from another persons act for ages, or it was a tossed around display model for ages. The chrome like tape is bent up and already pealing off right out of the shipping box. Then when you go to unwind it into a stand, it doesn't even make a whole circle, it makes a wide c. Totally not believable!! Why, because it's all warn out. If it were new, as advertised, then it would be a gem. I'll never buy from them again!<br /><br />Ok, so I contacted MJM Magic and eventually filed a complaint. They say they get this straight from the manufacturer, well the manufacturer is out of business. Here's what they wrote on my feedback:<br /><br />1 out of 5 \\"Sent a warn out and used appearing mic stand. Bad business practice if you ask me. fasle advertising. Came quick though!!\\"<br />Race (edit this name), September 11, 2013<br />Seller Response: This is one of those customers who refuses to be satisfied. We shipped him his item as it came to us from the manufacturer, and he wasn't satisfied with it (even though we offered him a 100% refund, he still decided to keep the item). He refused to accept our resolution to take the item back for a refund, claiming he \\"wouldn't feel right sending it back\\" to us. As for his claim, we NEVER send out used merchandise. Why would we?! Not only are we a reputable store, but any items returned to us get sent directly back to the manufacturer for a full credit, so there is no benefit for us to send a used item when we simply get our money back from the manufacturer. Unfortunately, this customer couldn't be satisfied despite our multiple attempts to communicate with him. Simply read our other testimonials to see what everyone else feels about our reputable service!<br />Date: September 11, 2013<br />3 out of 5:\\"When I opened the box one of them was broken\\"<br />Kyle H., September 9, 2013<br />Seller Response: Please feel free to send it back to us and we will be more than happy to exchange it for another one. :)<br />Date: September 11, 2013<br /><br />I just emailed MJM Magic this, so, I hope I'm helping you folks by sticking up for us:,<br /><br />Sorcery International<br />777 Patrick J.

The issue is, that to get them from a supplier<br /><br />or manufacturer is impossable for there arent any suppliers of this product other than some<br /><br />merchants here and there who have relatively few quantities. So,  instead of enjoying my<br /><br />product, I went beyond my fun scope to prove this company can eat there own words, and again<br /><br />lies.<br /><br />On my first email/complaint to them, I mention scratched. doesn't coil properly, heavy ware and<br /><br />tare, and used, three times.<br /><br />MJM's first reply stated that I am lying, that they only sell New!!, and only mentions scratches<br /><br />and the fact of being wrapped up and sent to me as they get it from them, the manufacturer. This<br /><br />is not possible do to my research proving otherwise. they wished for me to send the used item<br /><br />back at my expense.<br /><br />I send a picture as well, and post it to the original add for the product<br /><br />So, MJM tries to lead me to believe this came, not from a stock item on their shelves, but from<br /><br />the manufacturer. So, Since I ordered on sunday, 9/8/2013, the out of business manufacturer was<br /><br />able to get this product to them so I can be sent and recieved by me in two business days,<br /><br />basically 48 hours. There claim is proven false on this account as well. They must of got this<br /><br />from the manufacturer over 6 years ago. and, since it sat in their store for six years, I'm sure<br /><br />MJM would be scrambling at this point, do to already making false claims in their first reply.<br /><br />THIS leads me to their second reply,  Now, they agree there was zero packaging for this<br /><br />appearing microphone stand, that it was a loose item, for they want only the stand, base, and<br /><br />instuctions back. They would simply reutrn the defective item to the manufacturer who is no<br /><br />longer in business, for a full refund for their loss. That they have nothing to gain from<br /><br />reselling a used item.<br /><br />From there second reply, and what I know now, I am assured that this item would go to the next<br /><br />buyer from their mechant store on Amazon. For they cannot reutrn this item to any  manufacturer,<br /><br />and there are also no other suppliers or distributors in this case as well.<br /><br />This company has done nothing but insult me, with this bit about selling an item in new<br /><br />condition, when even my initial photgragh after opening the UPS delivered package showed<br /><br />otherwise. Also, they wish for me to help them make me \\"whole\\" again. Well, when I am a victom<br /><br />of any fraud or crime, my initial impression is to contact the authorities. I played nice and<br /><br />messaged them the best I could. I then contacted you at Amazon. Tomarrow, my bank to get an<br /><br />investigation started there. My next step is to file a civil complaint.<br /><br />NOW, this finally comcludes my issue with MJM.
