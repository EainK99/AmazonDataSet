Basically a glorified toy is what this cello is.  If you are buying it for your child to learn for school or personal reasons, DON'T!  One of the strings arrived with a kink in it and the pressure tuners are crap, no way it would stay tuned and very hard to tune.  Do your self a favor and rent one, shop around and find a good deal on a great quality instrument.<br />Good quality cello's cost any where from 600-1000 and you can rent to own one for less on a two year rental (at least at the store we found).
