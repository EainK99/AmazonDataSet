UPDATE:  Vendor sent me a replacement for my first order which failed to work properly  and at no cost to me  and the replacement tuner works splendidly;  I could not be happier with this one; my wife is happy with it too;  now  I will order one for myself to tune my guitars as the first tuner is for my wife's banjo ONLY.  Oh well;  I get the message.
