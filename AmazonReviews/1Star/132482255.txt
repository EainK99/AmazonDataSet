i've never liked behringer but figured i'd give them a shot with this headphone amp. but it was a bad move, i have to plug my input cable in half way in order to get sound and even when i do that it still cuts out audio in pro tools. entire tracks can't be heard because of this thing, so when i switch back my headphones to my mixer i can then hear everything in my mix. never again behringer, not only are your headphones crappy your headphone amp sucks as well.
