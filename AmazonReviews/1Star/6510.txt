Did not work with iphone 6.  Not sure if I got a defective one.  To make sure my iPhone plug was ok I plugged in the earbuds with mic and that mic was recognized and worked fine.  With this lav when I plugged in before or during video recording you heard a moment of static but phone stayed on internal mic.  I plugged plug in completely and wish it had worked.  Returned.
