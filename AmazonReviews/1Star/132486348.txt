When I got the CAD U37 USB Condenser Recording Microphone, I had high expectations. It has a HORRIBLE high pitched screeching noise and is difficult to record anything. I have watched videos on people using them and not one seemed to have a problem. The one I bought mush have had something wrong with it, I was NOT AT ALL happy with this product.
