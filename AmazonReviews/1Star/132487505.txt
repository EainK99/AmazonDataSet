Having moved to a small apartment in an expensive town i was looking for something that would travel well, fit in my tiny apartment and satisfy my music playing with draw i was suffering from having to leave my baldwin piano when i moved out on my own. Arrived home from work this evening to find my glorious package awaiting me. Tore open the box and found broken headphones, no biggie ill be buying better sounding ones anyway. Put the stand together, plug it in ready to awake the neighbors at 4am (im a bartender) and much to my dismay it wont turn on. No adaptor nor batteries can rectify my broken instrument. Sorry amazon. Ill be going to a music store to buy something i know will work
