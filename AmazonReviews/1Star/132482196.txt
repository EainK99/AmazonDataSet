These are cheap but not worth the money!  They are cheap Chinese copies of the better tuners made by Gotoh, Schaller, Grover, etc, but many corners are cut, with low quality gearing and materials.  Why anyone would put these on any guitar is beyond me, let alone a good quality instrument.  I threw them away.
