I am a band director who has seen at least 50 Mendini clarinets come through my door. I never recommend this brand, but somehow people still buy them because they're inexpensive. You really do get what you pay for. Mendini clarinets break constantly. Pads come off all the time. Most instrument repair shops in my area won't fix these because they are so cheaply made. I am a clarinet player myself and struggle to get a good tone on them - how sad that a beginner has no shot at making a characteristic tone. I would recommend buying a used clarinet made by a reputable company. I would never recommend this instrument to any student.
