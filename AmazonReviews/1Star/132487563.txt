This violin may look nice, but the quality is so poor that we had to return it. Our daughter's violin teacher as well as another professional tried to tune it, but it is impossible to tune and immediately gets out of tune, making it impossible to learn on.<br />There is another company that we purchased from which also has a good price but a much better quality instrument. Don't waste your money on this!
