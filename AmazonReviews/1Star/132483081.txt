If you are buying from fantastictone, here is my experience, so you know what you are stepping into.<br /><br />We were in dare need of an instrument because school was starting next week, so we had just enough time to order once, I found this listing and mostly positive reviews about the item, so was very excited.<br /><br />Item arrived as expected, but had some rust signs or something similar on the valve covers and scratches on the body. Even though it was wrapped as new, condition was obviously not as desired or listed. Seller offered to replace the trumpet, but we would have to drive for 3 hrs to do that and they are closed on weekends. We ended up returning it and filing Amazon A-z claim to get full refund, even then, return shipping was not covered. Seller conveniently used amazon policies to cut their losses.<br /><br />It just irritates me that this is allowed by Amazon.<br /><br />Anyway, hope this helps your decision. If you have a budget for a better instrument, then buy somewhere else. If willing to take your chances, make sure you live near Rancho Cucamonga, CA.
