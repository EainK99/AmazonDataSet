I bought this product in november of 2012 and it worked great until june 2013. That's when my (still unfinished) quest started. The keyboard stopped working out of the blue and I was told by Korg, since it was still under warranty to take it to their representative in Augusta Maine. I did that on JULY 3rd (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and as of yet it hasn't been fixed yet. I called Korg a week ago to ask if they would give me another keyboard or at least speed up things with their representative. I was told they'd call me back in a day or so, but so far it hasn't happened yet. Since then I called Korg already twice but the person I spoke with initially wasn't there and the one covering could not help me at all. Fortunately I don't make music for a living or I would be in a rough spot now. Bottom line: Whether that's how Korg treats their customers or if this was just a mishap I will not find out as I'm never buying any Korg products anymore.<br />Although this is a very decent keyboard there are many others in the same price range, with equivalent features thus spare yourself from some aggravation and don't by the PS60.
