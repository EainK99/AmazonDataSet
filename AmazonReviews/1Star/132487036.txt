Bought these about a year ago.  I've been through this twice with these. Once they run for about 60 hours, they turn brown and get very dim. These are fine for throw away use such as making something for a craft. But don't install them on anything you expect to get a long life out of. You get what you pay for, and these were dirt cheap.
