This light started flickering after only five weeks of use. That makes one of the two lights unusable which defeats the purpose of buying the double light book light. This is the second time I have tried to purchase an LED book light from Amazon and the same thing has happened. Why do you sell products that you probably know are not going to last very long? Very disappointed.
