Worst headphones ever. I have the 7$ Panasonic earbud headphones from Amazon that have better sound quality and better noise isolation than this. Also, after one week of using it, one of the sides stopped playing altogether, and now it is useless. I wanted to get a nice pair of headphones, but these are not the ones. Get the Panasonic earbuds, much better.<br />I also want a refund but they will not refund my order.
