You have to wipe down the guitar EVERY time you touch it.  Not &#34;Play&#34; it, Touch it!.<br />It has a good sound.  It holds a tuning between being tuned. It's slightly heavy as you might expect.  The metal corrodes at the slightest touch of a normal, non-oily hand.<br /><br />I'm afraid to play the guitar because I don't want to have to polish it from stem to stern just because I wanted to do a little back porch strumming.  If you want the guitar to put in your window so everyone else can look at it and admire it - then this is the guitar for you.  If you actually want to be able to pick up the guitar and play when you want to, then you need to avoid this guitar!
