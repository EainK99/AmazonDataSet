strapping on my ibanez literally moments after the strap busted from neck bolt almost dropping my guitar to the floor on further inspection the fabric and fibers were really weak and weathered almost like a floor model that had been used my guess is this strap has been on the shelf for far to long and product rotation or care is not in this businesses checklist of things to do I love LM products but this was a terrible experience shop elsewhere or at your own risk
