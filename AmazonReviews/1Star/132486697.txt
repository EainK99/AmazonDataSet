The pictures were misleading.  The &#34;gold&#34; lettering on the knobs was green... Maybe antique gold? Not like the picture.  The lettering was smeared so bad I could not make out the numbers on the knobs.  The plastic was not the plastic one typically sees covers for strat pickups, solid and like ivory.  This was more like the plastic you see used in cheap plastic toys you find in gum ball machines.  Instead of a solid color, the white color was weak, like their wasn't quite enough white in the plastic.  I don't know.  I took a chance and lost a few bucks.  No worries.
