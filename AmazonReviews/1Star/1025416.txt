I have a headset mic that works well with my AKG wireless system, but this lavaliere mic does not work well at all.  You have to be an inch away from it before it picks up and if you turn up the volume it has feedback.  I tried adjusting the gain on the AKG unit and everything else I could think of and it is just a piece of junk.
