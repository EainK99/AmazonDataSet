Same problem as Azeara Starr and cnfdrcy:<br /><br />The bow was very warped and already had hairs coming off, it was left tightened when you are supposed to loosen it while not in use. It wasn't even shipped in a box - the seller rolled it up on a single piece of cardboard and taped it around to hold it together.
