Perhaps I received a case that somehow got something spilled on it.  But, upon receipt of the case it smelled so strongly of xylene or toluene that I hung it out in the garage for a week to see if it would air out.  It did not!  I was concerned that the solvent that was outgassing would destroy the finish on my guitar. Amazon is great, they took it back without complaint and I purchased another case, the Gator GBE Classic, which is excellent for the money, albeit not as thickly padded as this case was.  I have no idea if my guitar would even fit this case as it was never placed in it.  I can tell you that my Yamaha CG 102 classic acoustic guitar fits the Gator case perfectly. If you are willing to run the risk of receiving a case like mine, I can tell you that this case was made of good material and thickly padded with a generous pocket for music. I was sorry to have to send it back and rate it so low.
