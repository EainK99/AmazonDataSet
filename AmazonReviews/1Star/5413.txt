Same deal here. Seemed to &#34;compress&#34; the signal when I first got it. Not very impressively though. Pulled it out of my chain and came back to it two months later. Nothing seems to function on it except the level knob. I have three other joyo pedals that are great but this one is a dud. I have the ubiquitous, blue, Boss Comp pedal that also took a dump on me. I think it might have something to do with constructing a decent comp circuit. Something that can't be easily imitated in a factory in China. Leveraged against the price other the other Joyo pedals I have, not a huge loss.
