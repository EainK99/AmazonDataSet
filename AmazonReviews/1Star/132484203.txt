I bought this for my son's 61 key Yamaha YPT-230 keyboard.  A 61 key keyboard was supposed to fit.  It does but just barely and now the zippers are starting to come apart because the fit is too snug.  You have to stretch the zippers to allow the keyboard to fit in the corners. We bought it less than a month ago. It also has started to rip on the bottom. Might work ok for a smaller keyboard but not for a 61 key.
