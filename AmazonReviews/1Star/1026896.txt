I want to say good things about this company and the product, but I cannot at this point. I've been in the music business for almost two decades and used all kinds of equipment, so when I say I tried all ways to get this to work, I can say I did with some know-how. The product I received is defective/doesn't work. This is very disappointing, especially since I live overseas and trusted the company and reviews enough to spend extra time and money to get it over to where I live.<br /><br />From here, it's expensive--in terms of both time and money--to order something from the states through Aramex. To return it, the compensation is as if I am in the US, but from here, it was way more expensive to drive to the depot to pick it up, pay a huge fee for overseas forwarding, and now drive again and pay a huge fee to ship it back.
