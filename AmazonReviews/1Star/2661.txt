The second day I turned it on the noise was back even worst then ever.  If i just touch the reducer pedal or the amp or guitar plug it makes a loud noise. after I install the noise reducer I took it out, and there is less noise then with it in line . took it apart to see if there was a bad connection.. it has a 1/8 steel plate on bottom when removed this thing weights nothing. Opened it up and looked inside very cheaply made plastic plug ends for amp & guitar. Says designed in Germany but all part are China junk..Will not last long if you unplug it much. I am not happy with this produce. I have a Behringer tuner and its works Great. I would not recommend buying this pedal.
