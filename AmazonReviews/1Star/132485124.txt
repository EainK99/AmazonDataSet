This is inexpensive - reason is that the LASER output is very weak. It won't even fill up a 15' x 10' x 24' open foyer.<br />It's only designed for a small bedroom at very best. It's in an aluminum housing, the power cord DC socket connector sticks out 1/4&#34; of an inch - exposing bare metal. I would not classify this as a &#34;Stage DJ Light Projector&#34; for the fact is - it just has no output power. Look elsewhere my friends.
