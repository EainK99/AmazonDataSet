I love the sound of the drivers, and I really like Shure's products and supporting a Chicago-area company, but the build quality on these cables is really lacking.  In mid-July, I purchased a replacement cable for headphones than were just slightly over two years old (and thus out of warranty).  By mid-September, the insulation was stripping away and I could see the red wires.  I'm thankful, at least, for Shure's easy warranty process.<br /><br />Update: I received a new cable per Shure's warranty process, and, again, three months later, the wires are showing, the insulation is splitting, and I am off to the post office.  I'm thankful that I have another year left on the warranty; I'm not looking forward to when the cable is out of warranty.
