Be aware, you will receive an iRig counterfeit item if you buy from VONOTO. They deleted the iRig logo from the pictures though.<br /><br />The part that I received creates a static sound every time a string is pulsed and there is no way to filter it.<br /><br />Save the trouble and go for a legit option.
