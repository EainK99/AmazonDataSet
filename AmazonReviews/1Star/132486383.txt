Do not buy these if you're looking for a quality, full sounding headphone. If you're going to DJ at a club, especially do not buy these. If you're creating tracks at home - it's a no go too. In addition to the limited sound spectrum these headphones cannot handle any volume. They also are just about useless for DJ'ing. I have to wear them backwards so I can use my right ear to cue tracks while mixing because the swivel on the ear pieces swivel inward not out ward. Huh? I don't know what I was thinking when I bought these. Don't be cheap - buy a good pair of headphones and save yourself the hassle.
