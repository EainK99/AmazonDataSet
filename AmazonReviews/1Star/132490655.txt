Not really much to say other than: it didn't work. At all. The cable comes with no instructions, FAQ, support, or website, so I basically got it in the mail, fiddled with it for several hours with several different midi keyboards and different interfaces.<br />I have a Mac, so maybe you'd have better luck with a PC, but still- if it didn't live up to what it advertised here, do you really wanna risk it?
