Lightweight with nice rebound owing to the foam core, nice stick-like sound against drum heads (as opposed to the strange slap of some multi sticks) and good stick articulation on cymbals.<br /><br />Extremely poor durability, unless I have a defective pair, which rendered them unusable halfway through a gig, brand new, right out of the bag.  I'm not a heavy hitter and play a lot of quiet venues in a lounge jazz/exotica band.  These deformed so that some dowels protrude above the others, one stick worse than the other but both of them damaged (see photo).  As far as I can tell, no wood cracked or split.  It's as if some of the dowels came loose in the base of the stick and grew.  They are unusable in this shape and I have written to Vic Firth.  I have used many types of multi sticks in the course of 7 years with this band, mostly ProMark but also the birch version of this stick by Vic Firth and I've never seen anything like it.  I'll probably stick to ProMark.<br /><br />Update:  Vic Firth was contacted and said they have not seen this problem before.  They were very good about sending me out a replacement pair of wands THAT ARE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING!  Used to play three quiet lounge jazz songs, kept in a stick bag the next day in my car for a few hours where they were exposed to some heat (not terrible) and *bam* they are deforming in the same way seen in the photo.  I think maybe the bamboo is not yet dead and is growing.  Bamboo is good luck so I've got that going for me.  Which is good.
