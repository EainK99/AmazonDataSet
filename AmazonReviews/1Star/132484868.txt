I guess if you have no other choice, this tube will work. But I would not suggest it. These tubes are made somewhere in a former Soviet country. They work, but they don't sound all that great. Of course, these days, there are very few choices when it comes to new vacuum tubes. You can find much better sounding tubes on ebay.
