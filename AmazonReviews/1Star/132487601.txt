I wouldn't bother with one of these, just spend a few more bucks to get a good one.  The holes didn't even line up on my MIM Telecaster even though it says it should.  Not only do the holes not match but it didnt fit around the electronics cover either.  This thing is crap, good thing I have a dremmel tool
