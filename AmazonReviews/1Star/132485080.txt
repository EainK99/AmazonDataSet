Disappointment awaited the morning after I received the Audio Technica ATR 2500 USB  condenser mic. After easy initial  download of drivers in my Windows 7  system operated PC and recording several nice audio quality clips. I assumed everything was o k. How wrong I was when next morning when trying to use mic I got several error messages from Windows saying Windows does not recognize this mic! I tried to unplug and plug the mic several times as suggested by Windows and all to no avail! This is the second Audio Technica product in two weeks that failed,the other being a turntabe that had been working good suddenley speeded up! This is the second turntable from this company that had the same problem. In fact this turntable was a replacement for the earlier model! I mention this to make clear that Audio Technica has a serious problem with it's design of their products! I am returning this ATR 2500 microphone to Amazon for refund. I had reservations about ordering this item on Friday 13th and guess what!! IT happened. I doubt verymuch I will purchase another Audio Technica product of any kind.
