Okay, I'm giving this a 1 because i did not know what i was really ordering. See, at first, i thought i was buying a playable violin that i could learn something new on. However, what i realized is that this in fact is not a violin for playing but actually and ornamental piece that you hang up in your room hoping no one asks you to play it or touch it because they will find out it is made out of plastic. So, if you want a $60+ thing that makes you look artsy fartsy get it. I however, if you don't want to be &#34;that guy&#34; then dont buy it. I returned it because it was getting in the way of all my doodads on my desk.
