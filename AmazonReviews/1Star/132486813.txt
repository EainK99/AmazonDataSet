The theatre I'm currently working for has been using these mics for a couple of years now, and I haven't been able to get through a single show without one of them failing on me. (I'm an audio professional, designing and running sound for almost 10 years) On more than one occasion, the mics have turned themselves off or forgotten their frequencies, even while locked. The screen breaks if you breathe on them wrong. These are not great mics for heavy dancing shows or even heavy singing shows-they will let you down every time.<br /><br />Yes, these mics are cheap. Yes, they are a great deal. But buyer beware-you get what you pay for. You would be better off investing in better quality equipment that will last more than one show instead of continuously buying and replacing these disposable mics.
