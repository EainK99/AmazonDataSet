it was dusty as heck. looked like the box came out of the bottom of a horders filthy house, with goup all over it and stuck to it ripping off some of the paper. was not packaged with care, the screen was dusty.<br /><br />luckily it works tho, except the record feature. not sure it was worth the money!
