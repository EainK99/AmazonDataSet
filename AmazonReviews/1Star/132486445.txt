I had problems getting this to go through my bocal.  I thought I might be doing something wrong because I'm new to bassoons.  I asked a local professional musician who looked at it and agreed with me that there is too much fabric to fit through my fox bocal.  He said it might work for an oboe swab, so I'll give it to one of my oboe player friends.
