Returning immediately after I received due to the back-right bottom screw not able to go in very far.  It's just barely able to be screwed in very crooked.<br />The fact that these hand-screws are obviously screwed in by a person, and this person didn't stop this defective stand from going out is a joke.<br /><br />see this: https://s3.amazonaws.com/elouisyoung/odyusa_mis-aligned_screw_holes.jpg
