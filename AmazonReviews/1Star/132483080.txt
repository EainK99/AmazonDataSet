Based on all the positive reviews, we shelled out the $500 for the Sennheiser HD 650 headphones thinking they would be better than the Sony headphones we already have (MDX something, $200).  We received the Sennheisers yesterday, and they are going back today.  I can't really say that the quality was good or bad, because, even at the highest volume, it seemed I had noise dampening earplugs in.  The little booklet that came with the headphones says that the Sennheiser phones make one feel surrounded by the music...I was left wondering, \\"Where's the music?\\"  I kept searching the phones for a switch or volume control, or something that would indicate a bad connection or damage, but to no avail.  Lesson learned; more expensive does not always mean better.
