These are very bad headphones.<br /><br />They won't stay on your head unless you perfectly balance them and dare not to move your head a bit. I guess that's really as far as you need to go in the review. My seven-year old was pretty disappointed.<br /><br />Sure, sound comes out, probably fine enough for kids listening to music. And, the lights on the sides do flicker on and off while music is playing. Might have been fun for a rave or paint party, maybe even a Daft Punk-inspired halloween costume.<br /><br />But, these headphones are absolutely poorly designed, poorly manufactured, ill-fitting and won't stay on, even when you are sitting still. I hate to write such a negative review,<br /><br />Someone at First Act clearly dropped the ball whenever it came to approving the production samples for going to market. I wouldn't be surprised if it were to be his or her \\"last act\\".<br /><br />(If you could find a way to get them to stay on, maybe velcro them to a headband, it would be a good way to increase visibility while running at night.)<br /><br />((Note: These are intended for younger children, and as such whom should not be encouraged to attend raves, paint parties, or to be out running at night.))
