This did not work for me and my 1979 Technics Direct Drive turntable w/ Yamaha Amp. I also tested it on my friend's later model Technics turntable and earlier model amp. Once connected, it just created tons of static and interference, very choppy, not listenable. Same result on both set-ups. I will try another pre-amp and see if anything is different.<br /><br />(Also, they sent me a black one and in the photo it is white.)
