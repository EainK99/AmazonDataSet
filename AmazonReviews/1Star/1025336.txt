I can't believe how many 5 stars this unnatural pedal received! I'm a Mesa Boogie tube amp player and I realize there is a need for solid state sounds IE; full on metal etc. Line 6 is a wonderful solid state amp with many huge epic sounds (don't get this board and just spend a little more and get a Line 6 amp and you're set in the solid state world) Not only did this pedal get great reviews but I always just loved boss' effects, so I thought I was good to go. BUT this pedal is the thinnest, most unnatural, plated sound I've ever heard. It doesn't even come with an adapter. So I thought the pedal didn't get a long with my Mesa Boogie Amp so I tried to plug it in direct to the PA (and it only comes with a 1/8th stereo plug in for recordings/PA .. O brother!) and it even sounded worse! No real stereo and it even got thinner!
