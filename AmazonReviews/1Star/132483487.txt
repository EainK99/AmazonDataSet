I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for her birthday.  It arrived promptly. I had a feeling that the package had been opened; but, not sure maybe it was normally packed like that. Everything was there. My problem was that the driver on the DVD would not install on my Windows 8, 64 bit computer. I tried downloading the driver from the product site and installing it with the same result. The program installed okay I just use the mic with the computer so no Karaoke.  Okay, no big deal. I could have lived with out the computer. It worked on the TV just fine. It seemed well made and rugged.<br /><br />The biggest beef I had was that out of the 2,000 plus songs, my daughter and her friends did not recognize a single song. It was totally useless. The songs are so old I didn't know a lot of them. If you are looking for Karaoke for someone say 40 or younger this is not for you. You can buy some additional chips for this unit; but, you are still stuck with 2,000 useless songs and the extra chip is very expensive. I cannot recommend this product.
