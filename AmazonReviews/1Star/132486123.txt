I ordered this wireless PA system from PylePro for a horseback riding/teaching facility. Right from the beginning I was very disappointed in the limits for the transmitter range. When the instructor walked a mere 60 feet from the unit the signal was intermittent. I improved the signal slightly by installing an external receiving antenna just outside of the small building the equipment was installed in. The transmitting antenna on the belt transmitters are extremely poorly made and pulled out on both the units supplied. I understand that things like this can happen but here is the really big problem. Customer service is NON-EXISTANT with this company.  I can't even count how many times I have called them and been put through their cue only to leave mutable messages for their parts/service department that NEVER gets returned! After at least ten attempts over mutable days, I finally got some guy that could barely speak English (sounded Asian) and he assured me that someone would call me so I could order parts. Guess what, no call yet again. Out of pure frustration I called yet again and went through their sales department pleading with them to put me through to someone that could provide me with the needed parts. It appears that they answer their sales lines. This time I finally got my order placed through a very rude employee that seemed to be put out that he had to help me. I would ovoid this company like the plague purely based on the worst customer service ever. I hate this company and will never use them again.
