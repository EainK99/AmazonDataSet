When I open my box, parts were off everwhere. Took to music store for repair, or see if it would me good for my 6year son music lesson. First, they said it would be a waste of time repairing, because its too small for my 6 year son, and second the repair cost more then cost of guitar. Take my advise, go to the music store, you get what you pay for.
