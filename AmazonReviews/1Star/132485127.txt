I bought the harp via mail while traveling in the USA. It arrived with the case opened, without any plastic or seal to prevent this. The slide button was completely stuck and 3 holes simply don't play. I can't trade this because I'll leave USA in two days, so I don't have able time to do it. When I return to my country I will have to adjust it entirely by myself. Inspite of this, the harmonica has a cool look, is easy to handle and the holes that work has a good sound. I can't tell if this is a Hohner quality problem or Amazon's handle and care.
