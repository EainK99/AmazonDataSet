Every time I take my daughters to a music store, the youngest would head to the drum area and start playing on the bongos. She would sound pretty good for a 6yo, so instead of paying $100+ on one of those, I read the good reviews on this and ordered it from Amazon.<br />Sorry to say it was a waste of money. No matter how I try to tune it, the heads sound like plastic. No better than turning some Tupperware bowls upside down. Now she won't even play them at home, but still likes the good ones at the music stores. Very disappointed!
