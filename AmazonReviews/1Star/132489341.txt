I'd prefer to find something good about any product I take the time to write about, but in the case of this strobe light, the subject line says it all.  I don't think it's unreasonable to expect this product to last at least a year or two before dying, this one lasted two hours.  Please learn from my mistake and find another competitor's product.  The method for sending Chauvet stories about the use of their products is broken on their website.  I'm not surprised.  This is my first and my LAST Chauvet product.  Cheap  Cheap  Cheap.
