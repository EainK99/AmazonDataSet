I just got this item and after using it for only a week and it is broken. There is very little power coming seems the capacitor is not keep a charge. I Opened up the plug and everything in there look cheap and reused. The resistors look old and rusted, seems recycled parts and the board itself look very out dated and not new. Buy yourself a brand name instead of this one.
