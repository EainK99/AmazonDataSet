Maybe I just got a dud. Made in china, tuned in open strings, went up an octave, tunings were almost one half note sharp, continued down the fretboard,  open strings in tune. It turned out to be chinese made junk.<br />Originally bought because it was a Gretsch.  I wonder if their guitars suffer from poor quality control also.
