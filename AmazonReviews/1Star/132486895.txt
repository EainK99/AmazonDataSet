Note Please :<br /><br />Since the headphones are the same design on all of them, this particular review is for the model PHP 8450 which has a button on the cord that pauses the music so you can pick up a phone call.<br /><br />The other day I was coming out of my bank and a girl was sitting on a concrete ledge and said to me :<br /><br />\\" Hey, those are great headphones ! \\"<br /><br />To which I said :<br /><br />\\" They LOOK and sound great but they're built like crap ! Don't buy them ! \\"<br /><br />I bought my first headphones at Big Lots and the problem with these is the small rectangular piece of plastic beneath the earpieces. Its held on by two small pegs and the first pair broke when I tried to get it out of the plastic box/case.<br /><br />I took it back got another pair and when I pulled them off my head that pair broke as well because the pegs won't take the stress of pulling the phones off your head and snap clean off leaving the one headphone dangling in mid air with no support.<br /><br />The design for these things is crap.<br /><br />I used to be an electronics assembler and I glued them back on with Crazy Glue but the next time I used them, the rectangular piece broke again.<br /><br />Now I'm going to have to jury rig something so that the piece has something to support it so it hopefully won't break off every time I put them on my head.<br /><br />They work great soundwise and the phone answer part is great too but its outrageous that the thing breaks so easily when you take them off your head to hear something or talk to someone.<br /><br />A classic case of looks great but built badly.<br /><br />Save your money and buy better designed headphones.
