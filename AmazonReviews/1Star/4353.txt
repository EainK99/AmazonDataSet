The pictures below reflect how Rockville does business. It was listed as a &#34;NEW&#34; speaker. This speaker was broken. It was obviously returned for repair at some point. Someone ripped the back panel off that holds the battery in place, broke the microphone clip, removed the entire back panel to work on it, didn't fix the problem, replaced 1 of the 12 screws in the sound panel. Then they placed a non functioning speaker back in a plastic bag and boxed it up. Dumped the broken pieces that you see, in the bottom of the box. Then shipped it to me as a new speaker. The Bluetooth circuit board has obviously shorted out because it won't even light up or function. The picture shows power on but no power to the SD/USB/Bluetooth board. I would never spend another dime with Rockville. However, I must say that Amazon customer service did a great job trying to fix the problem. But it's a problem that Amazon didn't create. This is rockvilles fault. Rockville=junk
