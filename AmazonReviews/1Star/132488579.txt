The battery was weak--might have been run down from sitting on the shelf: for this reason the tuning light was intermittent and then non-functioning altogether.  The on/off switch did not respond.  The plastic casing was cheap and did not appear very sturdy.  The best feature of this tuner is that I was allowed to return it for a refund.
