I know I should have opened the package when I received it months ago... but I was waiting until I had a place to set up the keyboard. Recently, I got that space ready, opened the box, started assembling, and found I'm missing a \\"foot\\" of the keyboard stand. Not 'just' a screw, but a big, important piece!  I know I'm at fault. Check for missing pieces before storing it? Come on, what are the odds?  I'm here to tell you, it's not a favorable gamble. Please, reader, learn from my mistake!
