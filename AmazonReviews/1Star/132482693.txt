I was surprised when I got this, it only contains a cd and a wire connection.  I had to buy my own cassett player.  After getting all of that, it still doesn't work.  I have tried numerous things to get it to record an audio book, but it only records a few minutes and even though the cassette is still going, it only records a few minutes.  I am still trying to figure it out, but it is very frustrating and not worth the money.
