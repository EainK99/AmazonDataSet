I bought this tuner thinking it would be fairly accurate. I can honestly say do not waste your money on this item.<br />It is not accurate at all. I use the chromatic tuner for a stringed instrument. The light turns green when the string is in tune. The problem with this tuner is the light turns green even when it's no where near in tune.<br />I'm not exaggering at all. At one point it tuned the string. I then turned it off and turned it back on after realizing it's not tuned. I played the same string and second reading told me it was not tuned.<br />The whole point of this product is to get a quick tune. You never get a quick tune. Sometimes it doesn't even read the sound unless you're In a very quiet room with no background noise. Even then its junk.<br />Very disappointed.
