As a person who starts to enjoy the harmonicas, I feel that this product has just turned me down completely. I wanted this product because I want to have a harmonica in D major, well, guess what, the 3rd hole and 10th hole are defective when you blow in. Drawing is also very unresponsive. Also, the plastic feel is not very enjoyable, and the smell of plastic would bother you so bad. Such a shame for &#34;made in China&#34; products.
