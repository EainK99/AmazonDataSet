I have had 3 modules and they all have the same defect. The volume output on the right for the floor tom and ride is only half of the left. I exchanged the first one where I purchased it and when the second one had the same issue. I contacted Alesis and they sent me another new one and it had the same issue. Also they sent me the wrong cable so I contacted them and they sent me the wrong cable again. Alesis support is horrible. I tried calling them about a dozen times and never got through. I even left a message and never got a call back. Email is the best way, but even then I only got a response about 80% of the time. Shipping times was only one day for me since they are so close, but it took Alesis support took a month to resolve the issue due to their severe communication issues. Actually They didn't resolve the issue. I'm just back where I started because I decided it isn't worth the hassle and I gave up. Shoddy products and extremely poor customer service. I will never consider another Alesis product ever.
