Pyle-pro portable PA- Out of the box and assembled all this made was a loud humming sound. No adjusting worked. Pressing down on the headphone jack to assurre secure connectionin caused loud screeching and a noise like a short. I have been spoiled by my Anchor AN130 that I use to teach with full time due to a vocal disability. I needed something that I could use in another environment for short term. I have used a Caliphone, but it was too heavy to wear, it's ok in an emergency to sit on my desk and use. I wanted something smaller and more mobile. This is small and light.On this unit the belt attachment is poorly designed and not rugged at all. It hooks to 2 small plastic pieces on the back of the unit. They look easy to snap off. If one of them snaps off, the belt system is no longer usable. Not working and poor waist attachment design. Terrible.
