I bought this violin and had to send it back right after my son's music teacher looked at it.  I don't know much at all about musical instruments so I'm going to paste her email to me below:<br /><br />&#34;We are taking a look at the violin that you bought from Amazon, and it has a several problems. It would take about $85 to get it working adequately for the 6th grade class. The bow hair will not take the rosin. They used a really cheap product and it doesn't work. Both of the bows sticks are very weak.  The strings are way too thin. There is a spare set, but they are exactly the same as the ones that are currently on the violin. The body of the violin is not made well at all.  The wood is cut too thick, and is mis-proportioned so that the sound is very weak and thin. Our local repair vendors will not work on these instruments due to their low quality. They are essentially not worth fixing.<br /><br />The shoulder rest is not terrible, but your son said that he was having trouble using it.<br /><br />The quality of this violin is so low that it would be very difficult to re-sell.&#34;
