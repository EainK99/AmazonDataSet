The device did not have the treble cleff on it like it did in the picture.<br /><br />I connected the cables properly to my keyboard (Yamaha NP-30) and to mackbook (and tried connecting to iMac as well). I am using Garageband. Instructions said \\"the red LED will light to show power on.\\" A green light came on, but not a red one.<br /><br />The adapter did not work with either computer.<br /><br />Apparently, here on Amazon, the same device (looks identical in the pictures) is sold under different brand names, at different prices, and by different vendors. HDE, Sanoxy, Vic Tsing. Odd.. and suspicious.<br /><br />I ordered this adapter from HDE because a reviewer of this product had success with HDE. But I haven't.<br /><br />I am very disappointed, and am returning this product tomorrow.
