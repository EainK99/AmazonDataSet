These things are junk. Our pack of 12 pairs is down to 9. We have bought Firth sticks before and they have been great. Nova which is also made by Firth is just crap. The sticks are breaking within a day or two of use. Apparently I can't return them because I bought them too long ago. We hadn't been using them because the real Firth sticks were lasting so long. WARNING - don't buy these things. There is a reason they are so much cheaper than &#34;full&#34; Firth sticks. If given the opportunity, I would return for an Amazon credit and buy real Firth sticks
