I bought this because it offered an ear-bud connection.  When it arrived the big blue button was jammed and wouldn't return after being pressed.  I had to remove the rubber coating and proceed to trim the excess plastic off the button with a razor knife.  The battery that came with it was dead.  I had a spare laying around which worked fine.  The unit worked only a couple of times.  I was using it to pace my steps while running.  This worked OK for a couple of runs, then started acting strange, changing the tempo or volume or something else randomly.  The screen stopped displaying when turned on, and with some fidgeting it finally did, but then forgot all previous settings.  After pressing the buttons to reset my settings it gave up the ghost and stopped working altogether.  So in total it worked for about 3 hours.
