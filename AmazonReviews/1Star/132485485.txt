I ordered this folding bluetooth keyboard partially because it is one of the few that takes regular batteries (instead of having to charge a built-in battery using a USB cable and a computer). When it arrived (which was on time), all that was in the box was the keyboard and some sort of stand (for the device). The keyboard has a USB charging port and DOES NOT take regular batteries. However, the worse thing was that NO USB cable was included. The description of the product is very misleading. I put the keyboard right back in the box and I will be returning it.
