VERY DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />TOOK THIS CABLE TO OUR FIRST PERFORMANCE AND WAS GETTING POPPING AND CLICKING EVERY TIME I MOVED<br />AROUND.  THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THE GUITAR AT FIRST, BUT TRIED THE CABLE ON VARIOUS OTHER<br />INSTRUMENTS WITH THE SAME RESULT.<br /><br />THE ONE I RECEIVED IS UNUSABLE.
