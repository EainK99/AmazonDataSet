As a previous review stated, the buttons are cheaply made. Unlike the previous reviewer, my buttons broke while attempting to use the device the second time. They were difficult to sync, but with after consulting the literature, I was able to for about 10 mins before the battery died. Permanently. No matter how long we left them charging they simply would not turn on. This may have contributed to the buttons getting stuck. In hindsight, I should have returned them immediately but I wanted to make sure that the malfunctions were with the device and not the user so I had three other individuals to try them out. Providing enough evidence to support my theory that the device is indeed defective.
