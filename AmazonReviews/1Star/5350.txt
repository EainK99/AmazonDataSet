The first few frets on the guitar do not produce the correct notes. They are also cut too long for the board so they poke into your hand. The strings and the wood on the fret board really cut at your fingers in ways they shouldn't. The amp however works fine, as well as the accessories, but that stuff is kind of useless when the guitar doesn't do what it should.
