I volunteer to teach singing and music in a prison, and a small, portable keyboard seemed like a great idea. I suggested that our organization purchase one of these; I am embarrassed to say it is a big disappointment.<br /><br />The first sign of trouble was that the keys often didn't work -- at first it seemed that manipulating the keyboard to separate the layers would restore the functionality, but then several keys QUIT. And this is only in about 10 minutes of use.<br /><br />Then there are the spurious notes added into half the triads and ALL seventh chords -- some harmonious, some quite jarring. Changing octaves often helps with triads, but there is no relief with four keys pressed.<br /><br />At this point, I have to hammer on a key just to get it to play. Being that I'm often using it just to get a tone to sing in pitch with, it's functional; but if you're looking for anything like a piano keyboard in function, steer clear of at least THIS brand.
