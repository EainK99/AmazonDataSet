It works well while it can. Mine failed when I tried to use it the third time - two of the three prongs in the back that hold the tuner head broke, so I tried to tie it up with a wire but the battery is completely out. The plastic is so brittle and the battery went out of charge so quickly. Not worth the $9.95 price at Amazon.
