I have always thought Behringer made sub-par Pro product, but I had never tried their stuff. I took a chance here, and I am now the owner of a completely melted Carver CM Series power amp. I am contemplating filing a claim for this, but the problem is I have no physical proof. Save yourself the headaches here. Don't ever buy Behringer audio gear. It's the lowest end of &#34;fake&#34; Pro gear you can buy. You get what you pay for in audio gear. Yamaha, ART, DBX are really the top three brands for crossover solutions. Now...to go spend $500&#62; on a $70 mistake ;(
