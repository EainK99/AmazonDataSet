I had read other comments on other products inadequately packaged, which only made me shrug. Today I received two of these stands, packed only in their original, flimsy boxes. To say they were crushed and open would be an understatement -- they were ragged! Fortunately (for Amazon), this is a back-stage piece of equipment, so the scratches and dings are irrelevant; however, because the \\"boxes\\" were open, some parts came off and were lost (a screw and a nut). Small potatoes, but now I have to go to the hardware store and hunt up replacements. Wanna pay me for my time?<br /><br />WTF Jeff, we expect better of your company! I'm leaving a copy of this on the product and with the seller. Do better next time, like right now, today!
