this trumpet is of poor quality. I know it wasn't expensive, but it shouldn't be falling apart so soon. I have only had it a year.<br />The valves are sticking regardless of how much they are oiled. The caps on the valves have fallen off. Don't buy this trumpet<br /> its a waist of money. The paint has peeled off. Don't buy this trumpet. Now I'm going to buy another trumpet. Won't buy another mendini. It's a rip-off.
