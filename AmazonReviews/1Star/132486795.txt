Not sure if they made a mistake or not with my order, but the product I got had 2 fans but no USB port on the stand, or even a cable attached as described by them. No manual either even though it's easy enough to figure out. No contents list to see what you should be getting. Called and left message for Pwr+ customer service and no one bothered even to call back. So much for service. Returned the product and placed an order with iCraze instead that sells similar one.
