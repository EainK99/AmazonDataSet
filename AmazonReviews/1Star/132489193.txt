BEADAHOLIQUE TOOK THREE DAYS TO EVEN PROCESS THIS SIMPLE ITEM. I HAD TO CALL THEM MORE THAN FIVE TIMES TO DISCOVER THE STATUS OF THIS ORDER, AS AN EMAIL WAS NEVER SENT. THIS WAS A TIME SENSITIVE GIFT (ORDERED PLENTY EARLY ENOUGH) AND BY THE TIME IT WAS SHIPPED, IT WAS TOO LATE TO BE GIVEN TO THE LOVED ONE IN TIME.<br />I WILL NEVER, EVER, ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. EVER.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE TWO WEEKS TO WAIT FOR THIS GUITAR PICK, BY ALL MEANS ORDER IT!
