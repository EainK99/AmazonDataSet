Does fit my interior firefighting gloves! It would be better if the velcro went the whole length of the strips to fit different sized gloves. But mine I have to wrap it so tight to hold it in place, there is a 3 inch tall hanging and about only 1&#34;: of velcro holding them together because the velcro doesn't go all the way to the clip!
