Terrible ocarina, completely unplayable.<br /><br />The holes are not as pictured; I am unable to perform a C because the right pinky hole is way too close to the right ring finger. There is no space left for my pinky finger once i place down my right ring finger. The advertised ocarina has much better spacing and looks different in general. Just buy a more expensive ocarina... I should have known this was going to be a huge gamble.<br /><br />First picture is the advertised ocarina, the second and third show you what you actually get. If you look closely you can see that there is a huge variation in the spacing of the right pinky hole. Mine is impossible to play.
