1)  Ordered one months ago and got the wrong model.  I received the clamp version by accident.<br />2)  I emailed Stage Ninja to see if I could just buy the magnetic base and NOT have to deal with an exchange BUT no response.<br />3)  Too much time passed so I just ordered another magnetic base.  It came BUT the plastic near the microphone end was cracked.  The unit was unusable.  I ended up using my clip model BUT now the two mics don't match and I'm NOT sure I can close the piano lid as the clamp may be in the way.  The magnetic base model didn't have this issue.
