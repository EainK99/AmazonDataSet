The price is right but it's a really cheap board. The pedals are plastic. It feels cheap because it is cheap. The wah pedal is just crap. You have to use an external wah or external controller. It's prone to breakage as well due to poor build quality. I finally gave up and bought a much nicer PEAK MIDI fcb4x which is much smaller, built like a tank and has a large LCD display to tell you which patch you are on!!! They are on sale for $245 on the PEAK midi web site. I don't know why they are so much more expensive here on amazon.
