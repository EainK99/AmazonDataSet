THIS MIGHT BE A REALLY GREAT ITEM BUT, I WILL NEVER KNOW. IT WAS PURCHASED TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION<br />WITH ANOTHER ITEM PURCHASED BY THE SAME VENDOR THIS ITEM WAS PURCHASED FROM, BUT THE OTHER ITEM WAS<br />NOT DELIVERED AS PROMISED AFTER THE VENDOR RECEIVED MY PAYMENT !!! THEY RENEGED ON THE AGREED SALE<br />REFUNDED THE MONEY ON THE ITEM I HAD PAYED FOR AND STUCK ME WITH THIS ITEM THAT I PAID AROUND $20.00<br />THAT I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO USE FOR NOW !!! BEWARE OF THIS VENDOR !!!
