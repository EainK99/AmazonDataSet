My experience with Washburn's customer support has been appalling. Non-existent, in fact. As far as I ever came to having a hopelessly defective Washburn EC resonator dealt with has been repeated buck-passing. i.e. Contact your local supplier/importer/distributor. WTF! Stay away - or risk being burned!
