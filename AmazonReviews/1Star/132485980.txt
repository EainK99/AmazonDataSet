Received the clarinet on time and was so excited about the purchase. My daughter gets it to band class an notices a loose key. The spring was defective. Checked the procedure for using the warranty to get it repaired. Even though it was sent that way. The warranty certificate stated the warranty started November of 2010.So I returned the instrument for a refund. Amazon took care of this for me.
