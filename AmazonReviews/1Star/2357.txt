All the reviews that say there is a cracking sound when you use your ipod or anything plugged into the AUX port are correct. I tried several different cords and devices and they gave the same results. I bought this for my daughter's birthday and by that time the return window had lapsed. Unfortunately I cannot return now. I would if I was able to.
