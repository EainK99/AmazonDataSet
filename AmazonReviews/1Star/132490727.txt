After using the amp for 2 weeks the auto-biasing system told me one of the tubes had failed. Strange, but possible. I spent $120 and replaced all the tubes for good measure. Same issue when I powered up. Come to find out via some online forums that this is a common problem with these amps. Not good. Fender was no help at all. They said, &#34;sorry, take it to your nearest authorized repair center&#34;. I called 3 repair centers up to 100 miles away and none of them could help me. What a pain. I ended up sending it back to Amazon and getting a refund. I bought the equivalent amp from Ampeg and have had no problems. Fender really dropped the ball on this one. Maybe there are a few of these out there that actually work the way they should. But for $1400 its a huge gamble.<br />Maybe they will fix the problem in the next production run of these. Who knows?
