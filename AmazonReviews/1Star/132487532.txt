The xitel import was not as good as hyped...<br /><br />Described as bypassing sound card in creating recording on PC, it failed to create any recording at all on my optiplex 745 which has no sound card.<br /><br />So it was useless to me.<br /><br />Ill save it till i get another computer  w win7. It is a cheap gamble... who knows ... meanwhile i reconnend saving your money unless you like cheap gambles....
