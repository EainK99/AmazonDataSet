I was so excited when I bought this fog machine. I brought it into my photo studio with brand new painted wood floors for a shoot, filled it up with juice in preparation for a shoot the following day, and came back to a puddle of fog juice on the floor that ate through my freshly painted floor. This thing leaks EVERYWHERE. Even when sitting untouched. It produces a good amount of fog, but dealing with the leaking wasn't worth it, so I threw it out. I think the reservoir may be defective, but whatevs. POS.
