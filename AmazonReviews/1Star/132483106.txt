This was new and sealed in a plastic bubble package.<br /><br /> I tested it and there wasn't any sound.  My mic works fine with a longer cable and 3.5mm adapter.  The only audio with this Hosa cable was static.  It also seems poorly constructed with too much movement when it is connected.  I will be returning it for a refund
