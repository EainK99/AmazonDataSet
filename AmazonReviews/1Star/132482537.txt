I bought these with high hopes. They sounded great at first. Good tone; warm.<br /><br />A few weeks in, one of the strings started to buzz occasionally, and get exponentially worse.<br /><br />Turns out that the string had flattened at the fret wire. Eventually it buzzed so much it was unplayable.<br /><br />1 month of playing on these strings, and I'm replacing them.
