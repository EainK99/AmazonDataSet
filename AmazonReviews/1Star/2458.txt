These just arrived in the mail today and I was very disappointed.<br />Before I say anything else, it was mostly my fault for being disappointed because my expectations were too high without compleatly reading all the discriptions. The notes only go up to an Eflat, which is not high enough if you are trying to memorize the high notes for the flute.<br />The cards are such are bright color that it nearly blinds you.<br />They were WAY too expensive! If you calculate it out, it's nearly $2 each card! I'm not sure why I got these, but I was expecting much more.
