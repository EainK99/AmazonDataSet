This product is not very good.  I would have given it no stars but system won't allow for that.  My granddaughter was very disappointed as the guitar does not look as good as the picture.  The guitar would also not stay in tune even after following the distributors instructions.  Trying to get my refund for this has been a challenge.  I had to contact the seller after 10 days and ask when I'm going to get my refund. I still have not received it. I wouldn't recommend this seller or the guitar.
