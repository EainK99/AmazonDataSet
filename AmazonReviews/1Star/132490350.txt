I bought one of these for my Strat.  I am a very busy working musician/artist.  The case started falling apart at the seams on both front and back sides by the regular (not vertical) handle exposing the foam rubber.  The front pockets also did the same!  This happened in exactly one year!!  The materials are cheap and cheesy.  I told my rep where I bought it and his response was \\"Well, you have had it a year\\".  Needless to say I was not pleased with his remark. Typical musician working at a music store that doesn't want to cover any warranty issues.  My advice is stay as far away as possible from this product.  If you want a cheap bag, then buy one!  If you want a GOOD bag at a good price buy the Ultimate Support USS1-EG.  It was on sale for $29 at MF and is now $79 on Amazon.  It is $39 at B&H Photo.  US has discontinued them.  I don't know why!  They are bad ass! Retail $99.  Snap these up asap!  Worth every penny!  Even at $79!
