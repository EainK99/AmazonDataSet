Please note this is not the correct adapter for the Mighty Bright book light; in fact, it's not even the one pictured. The end that plugs into the book lamp is, in fact, male, not female, as required.<br /><br />Instead of using this adapter, I got a new one at Best Buy which is actually quite clever. Amazon carries it as well: [[ASIN:B0044MQDJM Dynex DX-AC1200 Universal AC Adapter]]. Unlike the adapter reviewed here, this is a very clever and adaptable device. It has a number of plugs for different devices that you can  use as required. One was a perfectly sized female plug that worked exactly as needed. What a good idea!
