None of the black wood is made of ebony, the nut needs to be filed down (replaced) the bridge is not curved enough, the strings are not in the right place, the pegs are not very good. All in all I got an estimate of $221 USD to fix the violin. $25 just to replace the nut. This was the worst decision ever. Worst!
