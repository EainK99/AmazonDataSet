Speaker works great for a period of time after which the volume keeps fading to zero. Same problem as other buyers (here is an example of another reviewer with the same problem: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E6EWGGY361TH/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ROT8HI).<br /><br />While it works, it works really well. But after a while it appears that a capacitor (?) heats up and the volumes fades away to only a murmur. My speaker was used very seldom, so the issue did not appear until after 13 months or so.
