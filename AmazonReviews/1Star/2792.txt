I wish I had read the reviews more thoroughly before ordering this.<br /><br />The instructions puzzled me because I did NOT receive what was described. In an apparent move to save themselves some money, what they sell now includes a cheap vinyl 1-pouch version that could very easily slip into the guitar and ruin it. It is NOT double sealed, as they repeatedly claim in the instructions!!!<br /><br />And based on the number of horror stories I've seen here about ruined guitars, there is simply NO way I'm going to trust this to humidify my expensive Olson. They must think their customers are stupid and/or insane.<br /><br />Shame on D'Addario and Planet Waves for this bait and switch. I'm returning it, and telling everyone I know to avoid this product.
