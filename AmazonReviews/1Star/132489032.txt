I received my Fender American Strat this week from Austin Bazaar.  I was fairly excited to try it out.  Unfortunately when I opened the Box it was a Tele.  Which is not what I ordered.  The funny part was it said it was a Tele on the box and someone placed a smaller sticker on it that said it was a Strat.  Changing stickers doesn't make it so.  Headed to my local Guitar Center where they hand me what I need.  No hassles.  Austin Bazaar is Bizarre.  Keep Austin Weird they say.  I get it now.
