For the sake of a few inches of plastic, Hercules could have made a holder that one could actually move away from the mic stand. Essentially, there is one position (unless one wants to use it horizontally or use it with another mic stand). I also think it would be a big improvement if the holder folded up - a feature I admire on many of Hercules products.
