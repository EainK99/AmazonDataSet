I have used the Digitech Vocalist Live 3 for nearly 5 months twice per month at church and handled it with respect (this means it was never left in the summer heat, also). This Sunday, it just stopped working. Fortunately still under warranty and two service centers nearby, but...quite a hassle and no longer have confidence this pedal will be reliable. I will be looking for a similar product that is more reliable.
