I bought this from Optimum Proaudio. it kept hissing, buzzing, and just generally not connecting correctly like my other behringer appliances. it also came WITHOUT a serial number, which for some reason is a sticker...meaning i could not download the proper software to run with this equipment. They could not give me a new serial number. After one whole month and about 4 hours on the phone and email, i finally sent it back with a refund but lost 10 dollars to ship it back as well as a portion of my life spent trying to fix the damn thing. do not recommend.
