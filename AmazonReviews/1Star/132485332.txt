Very disappointed. First off the company that sold this item on Amazon does not actually stock the item. They marked the item as shipped the same the order was placed but in all actuality the item is dropped shipped from somewhere else and does not ship until a week later. Second from all the research I did I never knew that this horn was made in Taiwan. The horn is very poorly constructed and has very poor intonation. Just terrible all around. Don't waste you money. Get a Yamaha or a Getzen or a Bach. Total bust. And on top of it all the middle man wants a 15% restocking fee.
