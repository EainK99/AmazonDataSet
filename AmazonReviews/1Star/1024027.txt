OK first off this is not worth the price range and if it has a discount it's because other people said this thing sucks.well it has the look of a well-made ocarina it certainly doesn't have the sound and I would've gave it more stars but in the description itself it says it was well tune and hand crafted which it was most certainly was not. You're looking for something that just looks good and is expensive this is perfect for you.but if you're looking for an actual ocarina that you can play look elsewhere,because this ain't it
