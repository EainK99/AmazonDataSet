Coming out of the box, it seems like a solid, well built unit with all the features one could want. 4 inputs and outputs, MIDI in/out, 4 sends, cool VU meters, and a USB hub! Unfortunately it's hindered by a couple of showstopping defects:<br /><br />The drivers are awful. I used 2.2.5 (for Mac OS X), and the control panel would not let me change the buffer length.<br /><br />It randomly disconnects and reconnects. It momentarily disappears from the audio drivers menu before reappearing, while making a faint &#34;popping&#34; noise through your speakers. Obviously, random disconnects of your audio device throw your DAW for a loop, at best stopping the sound and at worst crashing the whole thing.<br /><br />Sometimes when I connect it, the latency is great and I can record with no problem. Other times, it appears to have a half-second lag in both recording and playback. Unmanageable.<br /><br />Sometimes it seems like it sets its own buffer length way too short, because all the sound coming out is crackly and lo-fi. Or it might be truncating the 24-bit recording down to 16-bits. I don't know for sure, but either way it sounds AWFUL and you can't use it.<br /><br />All of these problems are present with nothing plugged into the USB hub on the back, but I noticed the more USB devices you add, it gets even worse.<br /><br />Finally, when I initially got it all 4 inputs worked, but after 2 days the first input stopped working completely. Even when disconnected from a computer, you can directly monitor the inputs with your headphones and watch the VU needle bounce. On my unit, this works for inputs 2, 3, and 4, but not 1, even with the gain cranked all the way up.<br /><br />In short, my unit was unusable.
