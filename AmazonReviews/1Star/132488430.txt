I was very excited for this to arrive, thinking that it would be a great way to practice while on the go; I couldn't be more disappointed and I initiated my return within 3 minutes of opening it.<br /><br />This product is truly terrible. You strum a piece of textured plastic with your right hand, while you simply finger chords or \\"play\\" a scale with your left hand. It's basically air guitar for $29. Note that this device makes no sound -- no strings to pick or strum -- so you'll never know whether you are playing chords or fingering notes correctly. The left-hand feel is just as bad -- nothing like a real guitar as far as I am concerned. I am inclined to say that using this product has the potential to hurt your playing, especially for beginners.<br /><br />You can save money by building and playing your own PocketStrings. Here's how:<br /><br />1. Get a piece of wood.<br />2. Draw some lines on it with a felt pen.<br />3. Play air guitar.<br />4. Hit yourself on the head with piece of wood.<br /><br />I agree completely with the other 1-star reviews. This product is, without a doubt, the biggest waste of money.
