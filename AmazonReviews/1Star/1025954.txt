Looking for the worst instrument ever produced?  Congratulations, you found it!<br /><br />This fife is made with the exacting precision of a blindfolded lumberjack.  The tone holes are misshapen and poorly cut.  It plays in the key of D/Eb - that is, it can be tuned to neither D nor Eb, but somewhere in between.  Trust me, I've tried both.<br /><br />If you are a parent looking for a simple instrument, get a plastic recorder.  Please!  If you're a musician or music teacher (ahem, like me) you will have an easier time tuning 100 oboes in unison than playing hot cross buns on this thing.
