OK so, years ago I got these purple Brain Picks and they were great. They were wonderful. Slightly thinner than the 0.73 ones I loved more, but still. I loved them for what they were! I got this set, excited to replace the ones I'd been using for years (I mean, they lasted a couple of years on me!) and they stunk so hard! Way thinner than before where it counts -- which is where I have to hold them -- and they feel slightly thinner at the string as well, but that could just be because my grip on them just isn't the same as before.
