My daughter loves to perform, so we thought a microphone might be the perfect gift. And it was, for the half hour that it worked. She LOVED hearing her voice amplified, and ran through almost all the songs she knows! The stand was the perfect (adjustable) size for a toddler/preschooler, and she liked the colors. She stood in one place with the microphone in the stand, and certainly wasn't in any way rough with it. Then, all of a sudden, there was a lot of static competing with her voice. She complained and we turned it on and off again, but couldn't get rid of the static. She eventually continued singing, interrupting herself occasionally to complain about the static, but still enjoying the toy. Then, I picked up the entire set and carried it downstairs to the playroom. When I went to turn it on again, it wouldn't turn on. I tried repeatedly. I popped the batteries out and put them back in again. No luck. The thing is dead, after a whopping 30 minutes of gentle use. We'll be returning it, and buying something higher quality so that our daughter can continue to sing her heart out.
