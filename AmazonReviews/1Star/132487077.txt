I ordered the golden age pre 73 and was excited to get it when I connected it and discovered it had an awful humming noise coming out of it... So I'm sending it back and ordering another one hoping that I don't get another defected pre 73.. But I must say besides the humming noise it did sound amazing.. But with my luck I received a defected one
