One of the tuning keys broke while I was trying to tune my guitar. I hadn't even gotten to the point where the string was putting stress on the key. The top of the key just broke off. Obviously, I'm not very happy and it makes me distrust the rest of the keys in the long term. Additionally, I tried to contact the seller, but their contact button didn't seem to work. For now, this product gets one star. If I hear from the seller, and if they send me a replacement tuning key, I would be happy to change my review accordingly!
