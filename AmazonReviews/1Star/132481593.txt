Delivery was fast and the price was right, but the quality was extremely poor.  I haven't tried it on my Jag yet, as I'm going to have to sand the saw fuzz off the cut edges of the pickup and bridge holes.  The outside cut looks OK so I'm thinking these are bought cut to shape and the inner cuts are made later.
