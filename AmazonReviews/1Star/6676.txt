First fret on low E was so high it was dead, had to mill it down just to get the thing to be playable, really sad, I had high hopes of finding a diamond in the rough.<br /><br />Fit and finish were good enough but for it to have an issue so big that the instrument was not playable makes me a little grumpy.
