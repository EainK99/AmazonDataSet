I've had the privilege of traveling and hearing real rain sticks. I've never bought one because you can't have the real McCoy without laying out 1-3 hundred dollars. In a moment of nostalgic weakness I thought maybe I could have the real deal without the huge investment. Silly me. This stick lacked the sound (you're more likely to imagine plain old noise, sand or small gravel falling or maybe a baby rattle, but not rain). You'll also lack the other dimension of the real McCoy and that's the tendency to go on and on, this one was done in about 3-4 seconds tops; it's just a rush from one end to the other of whatever materials they've put in there. I think this product might be improved if it had less material and material of dissimilar sizes and minerals, but then I'm not a musicologist, nor am I am expert in igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rocks. I've just heard the real thing many times and you distinctly hear rain, you don't have to pretend. If you are a real enthusiast stop at a real trading post and listen to the real thing. It may be beyond your pocket book, but it wont be beyond your appreciation. I can't afford the real Mona Lisa either, but if I'm not mistaken there are a lot more Indian craftsmen out there making these and there was only Leonardo da Vinci. If you don't hear rain pass on it.
