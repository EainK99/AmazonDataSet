The seatbelt material is so smooth that it has almost no friction.  The result is you have to spend time and energy keeping your guitar in front of you.  Let go of your guitar for a half second and the neck slides down to the ground.  Someone below wrote they liked being able to move their guitar all around and found other straps caused the guitar to cling.  I'm the opposite.  I like a well balanced guitar with a strap that holds it in place so I can get to work.
