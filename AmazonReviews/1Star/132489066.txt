Good luck fitting this on your pedal.  I wasn't able to fit this on my pedal (not enough room near the hooks to fit around either mechanism on the pedal) so I ended up buying a full DW spring assembly from another retailer.  You may also wish to note that this is NOT a DW-made part (as advertised), this is a spring with a felt insert that you can find in a hardware store.
