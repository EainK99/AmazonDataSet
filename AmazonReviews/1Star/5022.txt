I know this isn't a top of the line horn but I thought it'd be a nice compromise for my daughter during her intermediate band years.  First, like the other reviewer stated, this horn does not have a spec of Rose Brass on it.  It's dual colored not tri-colored as listed.  Second, the machining on the horn and screw bell is abysmal.  The threading on the bell is about 1/4 of an inch, but the horn itself is only machined to accept 1/8 of an inch so the bell has a huge gap between it and the horn itself.  Third, the strings that allow the valves to move when you press the keys we're all unfastened.  I had to basically tune the instrument myself to see if it even worked.  Forth, the middle key/valve was completely stuck (it would not move when pressed at all.  This quality of a horn this price is really shockingly bad.  Maybe I was just naive.<br /><br />As icing on the cake, Amazon sent us a previous returned one as the mouth piece had clearly been used and the instrument was COVERED in fingerprints.  We know the mouth piece was used because it was heavily tarnished (likely from saliva) and the actually sealed bag the mouth piece comes in was in the case but torn open and just left in there.<br /><br />This has been a supremely disappointing waste of time and money. My advice
