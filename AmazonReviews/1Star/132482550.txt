I bought casio ctk-2100 keyboard as a birthday gift for my girlfriend.<br />But I received CTK-2300 instead, which is $50 dollars cheaper.<br />The seller provided no solution but to return. We have to pay the shipping fee ourselves which is more expensive than $50.<br />We have no time to solve this any more. So we keep it. That ruins our good mood.
