Do not buy this piano (the Legato). If you want a cheap piano, put out another $50 and get the Allegra 2, instead. Otherwise, you will be totally wasting your money. The keys on the Legato are shorter than normal piano keys, and the tops of the black keys are curved front to back. It is a toy for young children. If you are learning piano, it will probably mess you up, and if you already know piano, you may find your fingers slipping off of the black keys. I bought the Legato on the web and had it delivered to a travel destination where I wanted one for practice, thinking that, being a full 88 keys, it wouldn't have these physical problems. I had tried the Allegra in a music shop, and it seemed OK for short term practice. I didn't realize how much of a step down the Legato was. Did the manufacturer really save that much money on plastic making the Legato keyboard?
