There are no specs listed of the drums in the description and when the drumset came I realized the drumset pictured in the listing is not the drumset listed.  The drumset pictured is the Reflex RSL Powerhouse.  A pretty big difference considering the main reason I ordered the drumset was for the 2 floor toms.  The RSL does not have 2 floor toms and you cant buy an extra one at this time.  It would be nice if the listing had the drum sizes...Then I would have realized the error before I purchased a drumset that is nothing like the one pictured.
