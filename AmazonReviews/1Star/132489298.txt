The sounds in this software are the BEST you will find in a VST for rap,pop,hip hop, r&b,dubstep however the software is very unstable when ran as a VST plug in any DAW. In Logic Studio and Pro Tools I can't save a song with the plug in active because it will not let me open the file or the beat I produced and it will illegally shut down your DAW constantly. Also you cannot place it on multiple tracks to use all the sounds individually. It has to be done in the BK software which makes it really hard to fine tune each individual instrument. I have to bounce all my parts to wav files in order to achieve this which is an extreme hassle. Overall the software is horrible and needs some serious updates but the sounds are some of the best around. I can honestly say with all the hassle it takes to use it, Its not really worth the time. Pass on this one!!!!!!
