This is a piece of junk ! It failed the second time I turned it on. When I tried to get it replaced, I found out that I would have to pay shipping charges again to send it back. By the time I got a new one I would have had $6.00  in shipping charges in an $8.00 item. So, I cut my losses and threw it in the trash and bought a good one somewhere else. I will not be having any more dealings with Schrantastic. You can bet on it !!!
