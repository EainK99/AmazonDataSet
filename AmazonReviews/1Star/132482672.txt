This brand was recommended by his orchestra teacher and I felt safe ordering from Amazon. When we opened the rosin it was dried and had a large hole in the middle of it. His orchestra teacher said it was very old and defective. I contacted the seller who sent me a message that I not only had to pay return shipping I would also be charged for the shipping to my residence and possibly a restocking fee???? WHAT A RIP OFF! Save yourself the aggravation and buy from a reputable seller!
