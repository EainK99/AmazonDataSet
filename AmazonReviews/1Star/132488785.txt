The description says blue, and the picture is of a blue guitar, but I got a black one. It also has a dent in the back and a bad scuff on the front where the finish is chipped off. It looks like the body is made of pressboard of some kind, not solid wood. I wasnt expecting a world class guitar for 90 bucks but I dont want this....So far, the return doesnt seem to be the usual easy return I expect from Amazon, but we will see.
