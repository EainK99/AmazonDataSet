Until you have this strap in front of you and fully understand the instructions for using it, the ambiguous statement -- clasps are not included -- doesn't make much sense.  But here's the deal -- if you want to use this strap, you have to DESTROY the original strap in order to harvest the magnetic parts that slide into the watch face itself.  Apple has encased the magnetic parts completely and you will have to cut them out in order to follow the rather ridiculous instructions provided by this manufacturer.  What a cheap piece of garbage this turns out to be.  No thanks!
