Absolutely terrible guitar! In this case you get less than what you pay for. It has the appearance of a guitar that a middle school kid made in wood shop. On top of that it doesn't have fret markers and the neck has this super glue residue,that makes it sound horrid and difficult to play. Save your money and skip on this guitar. It's simply an overpriced paperweight.
