I purchased four of these to replace some 50W Halogen bulbs in a track lighting fixture in one of my bedrooms. These bulbs appear to be very high quality, the size is EXACTLY the same as the GU10 bulbs previously in the fixture. While I can't give feedback on longevity (only installed these earlier today), I can say they are equally as bright as the 50W halogen bulbs they replaced, fit perfectly, lit instantly and generate so much less heat than the halogen bulbs that it's not funny.<br /><br />I'm going to see how these hold up and most likely will order more for a fixture in my kitchen.<br /><br />** I've had them for a couple of weeks now and after a couple days of operation, all four started to flicker when turned on. They are in a dimming fixture and it does not matter what intensity level they are on, they all flicker and it's maddening. After several minutes on, the flickering does dissipate a bit, but it never completely goes away. Returning them to Amazon, will stick with the original halogen bulbs for now, at least until LED technology can catch up. **
