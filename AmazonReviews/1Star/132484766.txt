The instrument or (toy) didn't work straight out of the case. It came with adjustment instructions.We took it to an established music store and they pointed out the flaws. To be sure she wasn't yanking our chain we compared,it to other violins and you could see the difference in craftsmanship and the bridge wasn't even fit and sized to the violin. My daughter purchased the purple one and sadly she is heartbroken. Now I have to scrape up money to rent to own a 600.oo quality violin. Save your money don't take a chance on this junk. It looks pretty but unless you want it for decoration,it's not worth your time or money!
