I purchased three of these to mount three different vibra-slaps for a solo piece. For the sake of full disclosure, I should say that none of the vibra-slaps I tried were made by LP. However, many of my percussionist colleagues have used this product with LP's vibra-slaps with similarly awful results.<br /><br />The mounting &#34;system&#34; is embarrassing; it is inordinately difficult just to get the bracket to grip the vibra-slap in a reliable way. The bracket is strangely awkward to fit to the vibra-slap, considering that it was ostensibly designed specifically for the instrument.<br /><br />Once mounted, the bracket mutes the vibra-slap so much that the instrument is un-playable, in my opinion. I was attempting to use three of these for a percussion solo piece that involves three vibra-slaps. All three did not sound acceptable once mounted.<br /><br />In an ensemble setting, I could imagine that these could work, given a very nice vibra-slap and an ensemble texture that does not leave the vibra-slap completely exposed.<br /><br />Overall, though, this product is terrible, especially considering the substantial price. I was expecting to receive a bracket that works perfectly with the instrument, and the brackets I received are not functional on the most basic level.
