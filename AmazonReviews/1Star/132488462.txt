I spent a solid 15 minutes trying to figure out how to even wear these things, and when I finally were able to get them in, they were very uncomfortable.  After that, I plugged them into my iPod and there was just static sound unless I held the cord in a certain way.  The package did not come with a receipt or an adhesive return label, causing an even more inconvenience.
