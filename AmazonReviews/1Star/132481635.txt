I did not attempt to receive a replacement, so maybe this is just a fluke, but I received the product, and it would not securely stay connected to my guitar.  I even tried attaching it with a female - male cable (which defeats the purpose of the product anyway), and the connection wasn't good.  I returned the product.  Very disappointed.
