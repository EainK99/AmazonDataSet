Based on reviews and a couple I heard in recordings, I gave one of these the chance.  It was a trash can lid at best.  Very trashy, short sustain, more of a whack and splat sound than a shimmering crash.<br /><br />I'm under the impression these cymbals vary quite broadly from individual to individual, so in a given lot of the \\"same\\" cymbals you have a lot more variance from good to bad than typical brands.<br /><br />Still, the comparisons to the major brands I see for these cymbals makes me wonder if these drummers haven't been wearing earplugs to practice for too many years...
