This item is terrible. Now I wasn't expecting great quality to begin with, but the bridge wasn't on, the neck was warped, and the tuning pegs weren't in right. All in all it cost more just in repairs than a violin would from a proper luthier. And that's just to get the damn thing playable. You're better off ordering from guitar center
