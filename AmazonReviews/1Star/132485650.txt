The first product description says classical nylon strings and says Product Features: Clear nylon trebles, silver plated wound basses, made in the USA. Read further down where it is only a single string. Also the main description says, \\"LaBella 416 Stainless Steel Classical Guitar Strings, Medium\\" which usually means a complete set. It is easy to miss where the description says it is only a single string.
