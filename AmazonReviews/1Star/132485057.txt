Well there's so many nice things ppl say about this item. That's good. My experience wasnt that. Got it thinking just plug it in an load software. Hmmm...apparently window's 8 don't have drivers for this product. Over a month now im still looking for drivers. *sighs* If anybody have a link post it to me.<br /><br />Update: Only got this product to work on my windows 7. That's a 5 star in my book.
