I have a line 6 guitar Port for many years, and I told to myself that is time to upgrade to a new line 6 guitar interface. So I got Amplifi TT, and I have to say that after four months, and trying many different set ups with my home sound systems, I am completely disappointed with the performance of the Amplifi TT, I can get a much better sound for my guitar with my old guitar Port than with this product, and I only spent $99.00 when I got it.
