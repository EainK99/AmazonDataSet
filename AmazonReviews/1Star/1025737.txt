Ridiculous. This may be a nice guitar, but ask anyone who owns boutique guitars how easy it is to sell them. Almost impossible. They are like cars, when they leave the lot, they lose half their value. New boutique guitars are a terrible investment. Very old beat up vintage stuff if you can find it, are probably good choices. Take it from me. I have a bunch of boutique guitars that I will never get par in my lifetime. It is a gigantic ripoff. Collings Guitars are a gigantic ripoff. Bill Collings got rich. Those of us buying into his factory produced overpriced guitars are sitting on a bunch of well made instruments that are overvalued. There maybe a few exceptions, but his factory puts out so much stuff that is mediocre that it makes his exceptional instruments seem overpriced. Gibson is just as bad. I predict that high end guitars will be hard to sell. This may not be true for Lawyers, Doctors and Dentists who can't play to begin with, but for real musicians who play for a living. All the great acoustic players of the 20's and 30's played on cheap guitars. Great musicians play on what they can afford. To hell with fancy, boutique, rich sob's guitars. They can pretend to play. Their friends may listen. G,C and D can go a long way for amateurs.
