A total disaster.  Not only were the frets a combination of Brillo and chain link fence, and one of the strap buttons stripped and sunken into the bout, but the pickups seemed not to work at all.  With a 60 watt amp turned all the way up all I could get was a very dull pinging.  I don't have the EQ to measure output but believe me there was precious little to measure.  Also the contact point of the clumsily-carved and ill-placed bridge seemed to further dampen the sound.  I don't even want to talk about the nut...<br /><br />Like an idiot I took alleged instument to a fine craftsman who did his best to conceal his contempt for this example of indifferent manufacture at its nadir.  He cautioned me not to place good money after bad.  Throwing caution to the wind, I traded 2 viable if inexpensive guitars to do what he could with my new nemisis.  The man did his best.  It was still not something that could produce music.  I hastily disposed of this piece before it could depress me any more than it already had.<br /><br />My question to me and to you is this:  why would you consider purchasing a guitar you have not played?  The world is full of many many more bad guitars than good ones.  Wait for the right good guitar to come to you.  It won't be this one.
