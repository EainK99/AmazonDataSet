I am a band director and just repaired one a one year-old Barcelona trumpet. It has been impeccably cared for by a conscientious student. The lacquer is already coming off. Worse yet, the valves had poor action and were not easy to get working again. I'd never heard of the brand before I saw this student's horn. Take it from a band director who has seen hundreds of trumpets go through my program. I would not recommend this.
