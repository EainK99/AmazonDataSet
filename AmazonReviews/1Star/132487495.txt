I bought these monitors after a fast test in a shop. The sound was quite good but as soon as I brought them into my studio, I realized that these two afwul monitors were really too noisy: clearly audible amplifier-noise.<br />But ok, that was not the main problem. After few weeks, one of the two monitors suddenly started producing a strong noise, and the light on the top turned to red. The woofer was moving a lot.<br />I sent them for an offical service in my country (Italy), but when they came back, the problem soon was there again.<br />I sent them again for a second service, yet... same story: when I got them back, the problem started soon again.<br />So I decided to surrender: I put them in a corner and forgot them. Recently I tried them up again and .. guess what? one of the two monitor was not working at all.<br />So what else should I say? These two ridicolous monitors are rubbish.<br />Bleah.<br />I'll never ever ever ever buy an Alesis product again.
