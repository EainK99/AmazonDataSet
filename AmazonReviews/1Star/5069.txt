Like most budget Epiphone acoustics of recent years, it totally underwhelms.  First off, forget the name.  The guitar sounds nothing like an actual Hummingbird, because it isn't.  Secondly, and critically, the sound the guitar does have is too thin and soft.  Thirdly, the fingerboard radius is on the flatter side of things at 14 rather than a 12, so it takes some getting used to.  Fourthly, the poly finish seems to have been put on really thick, and it almost seems to rub off, a little at a time, on your hand, which makes playing this thing difficult and a little gross.  Lastly, the factory setup was so terrible (couldn't fret any notes below the 10th fret) that it required a full setup, which only added 40 bucks or so more to the price.<br /><br />If you want a guitar in the $200 range, don't get this one.  Maybe through 100 bucks more down and go with a Blueridge BR-40.  That's a cheap guitar that runs circles around this one.
