Mic does not work with my iPhone 4s. Apps still pick up from the built-in mic.<br /><br />Even more disappointing is the complete lack of support and SLOW ship time from the provider. I would love to get one that works instead of returning it (or maybe I'm not doing something?), but I have received zero response in several days.
