I bought this pedal based on all of the reviews and the great price, but it was a mistake. I was very excited to receive the pedal and when I did, I was extremely disappointed.  I knew it was plastic and that didn't bother me, but it's extremely cheap plastic. I tried using a 9V battery with it and the cable that connects to the battery is very cheap and you have to jiggle the batter around a lot for the pedal to turn on. Also, the actual pedal to turn the effect &#34;on or off&#34; doesn't do anything. The distortion was always on. I would spend an extra $25 and get a better quality pedal. I sent mine back the same day.
