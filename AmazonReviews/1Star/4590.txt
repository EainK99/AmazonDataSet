The 1/4&#34; plug inputs are very cheap and do not hold the cord plug well. The are also attached to a circuitboard so they can't be replaced with a quality plug. I tried to return this item but was told that the window for returning is closed. I have only used this 3 times in my home. Thank god it started losing connection at home and not on a gig.
