I bought this pair of headphones through Groupon. When I tried it on, it felt good and had some decent sound.<br />Reason I'm giving this product a 1 star, is it lasted a bit over a month before it just stopped working. It produces a weird blur sound without any bass.<br />I would recommend this product only if it were to last longer, but this is bs. 1 month!!!
