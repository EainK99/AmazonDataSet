Very bright, colorful with nice patterns, but n-o-i-s-y!  Great for a party where conversations and/or music might distract from the noisy light.  Update: lasted no more than 3 months at about 12 hours per day... but let's say it was on 24 hours times 100 days which would be 2400 hours.  I would think that LEDs would last at least 10,000 hours!  One star.
