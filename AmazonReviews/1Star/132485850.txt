These are decent sounding headphones but I can't believe they are getting so high rating, especially for their lousy durability. These are the worst design I've ever owned as far as durability. They look great and sound pretty good, but after 6 months, the foam pads on the ears come off very easily and are difficult to put back on, and get more and more difficult over time. Also, bits of foam padding cracks and peels off and sticks to your skin. I'm really let down by these headphones and now have to spend more money to get a good set.
