This looked so fun that I couldn't wait for my daughter to open it for Christmas!  She was super delighted but after one day of playing with it, the CD didn't play, skipped, and one of the microphones didn't work no matter what I did to trouble shoot the problem (Power, unplug, replug, jiggle wires, switching it out to the other side).  My daughter was so sad that she ALMOST had this toy to play with, and while we took it back, she still asks me for a CD player w/ microphone that really works.  I really want to find one that is quality made, but also cute for a little girl.  This toy looks fun, but is deceiving, b/c it's just a colorful door stop.  Don't waste your time or money.
