I bought this instrument from the only seller listed for this item, as a gift for someone only to find out recently that the person had to threw it away because the drum's leather smelled like a dead animal and still had fur attached to this, it was so bad that the he couldn't even leave it out , because of the awful smell. I contacted the seller was told that it was probably the weather but the person who received it told me that it was not tanned properly, and the fact that it still had animal hairs is totally disgusting and unacceptable. After several correspondences with the seller they could only refund me if the item is returned but the it was already in the trash. So I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase, it was a complete waste of money.
