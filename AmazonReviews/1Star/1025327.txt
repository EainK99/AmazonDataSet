iRig has the worst customer support. The Lightening iRig that I purchased came with a 30 pin and didn't include a lightning cable. Simple fix right ? Just call customer support and ask them to send a cable that will connect their proprietary jack on the iRig to my iPad air 2. First problem...No phone number; email only. I emailed and their response was that I am required to send a copy of my receipt. I scanned the receipt and sent it as a PDF. their reply was that it was in the wrong format and that they required a picture. Next try was taking a picture with my iPhone and send that, and their response was that was the wrong format; they said it has to be a jpg format. I gave up and just went to the apple store and bought an adapter for $30.<br /><br />Beware- I purchased a two iRig lightening keyboards, and neither one included a lightening cable, so be prepared to purchase a 30 pin to lightening adapter, if you're using any of the newer IOS devices. On the bright side...I worked great right out of the box with the older iPad. Just don't expect any support if you have an issue.
