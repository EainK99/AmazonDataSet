I bought this because I have a hard time with the noise in large crowds and thought these would look more fashionable.  I can't say they worked all that great at filtering noise because I lost one about 15 minutes in the event I was attending. When I ran my hand through my hair it caught on the ear piece and it fell out never to be seen again. They stick out just enough to be a problem.  Probably easier and less expensive to stick with the cheap ear plugs at the drug store.
