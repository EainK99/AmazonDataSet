I was disappointed with the Violin.  After a week of use, my daughter realized it took longer to tune this violin then others.  The pegs are stuck.  They don't move easily.  Have to tune often.  The grip of the bow is loose, so its diffficult to hold.  The rosin that came with it, seemed it has been used before.  Very disappointed with overall products.
