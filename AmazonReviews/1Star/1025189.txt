I decided to pay a little more and get the Artist Jones reed over the regular one with red thread. I am very disaappointed in the quality. It came pinched closed and a leak on one side near the thread. Soaking in water for a few minutes helped a little bit but the reed sound quality is no good compared to other cookie cutter reeds.
