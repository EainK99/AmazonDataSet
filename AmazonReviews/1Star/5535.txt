I'm a professional electrical contractor in the Colorado Springs, CO area. If I could give this product less stars I would :) Bad color temperature. Way less lumen output than advertised (I would say maybe 80-100 lumens per foot, and that's being generous). The &#34;3M&#34; adhesive backing doesn't stick to even a new clean surface. Also, these are indoor only, don't be fooled (or confused?) by the conflicting product description. Decent product (Diode or Super Bright LED are two decent brands) runs about $ 10 per foot (depending on lumen output). I chalked up my wasted 20 + bucks to &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; experience.....just want to save you the same loss :)
