Bought this pedal a couple of months ago and on my first important gig the cable snapped on the first song.<br />To be fair the company replaced the cable but I could never trust it in a professional situation again.<br />As others have said great in theory but it's just far too fragile and at £89.99 isn't cheap. They obviously<br />did no R&D on this product and it is completely unreliable. Avoid like the plague.
