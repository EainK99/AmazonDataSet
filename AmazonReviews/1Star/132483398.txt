I agree with the previous reviewer Ryan, I too experienced the exact same shaking noise which sounds like one of the speakers are blown (the one with the blue light).  I just bought these only 5 months ago and has never raised the volume more than 30% which says to me that these speakers are cheaply made.  I now have to buy a new set all over again, but certainly not this brand...Avoid this product!!
