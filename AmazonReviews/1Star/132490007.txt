We ordered this product and it arrived broken. We ordered a replacement and returned broken ball. At that time we stated we needed it for a certain event date. We were informed it would arrive in the time needed.  Somehow it got put on a wrong trucka nd shipped to another city.  By the time it arrived it was the day of the event.  It came broken!! We were forced because of time restraints to cut, glue and tape it together for use that evening.  What a disappointment. Of course now we had no choice but to keep it as we used and altered it.  If this item can not be shipped to arrive in good condition perhaps it should not be available from you. I really feel sofme money should be credited to my account for this problem and all the aggravation and having an iffy product.
