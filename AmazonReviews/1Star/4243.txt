When I received this product, I was completely elated, as I do like violins, but mine came in extremely poor condition. The rosin was broken into many tiny pieces, I could set up the bow correctly, as well as the bridge on the violin. However, this violin was unplayable, and the violin's black varnish was unfinished to the extent of absolute shame. Also, as a final note, the violin was extremely dusty and filthy. The bow looked as if it had been used before, because it had loose hairs. I will never purchase this again, and I do not suggest ever buying a cheap violin.
