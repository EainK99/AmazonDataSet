This protection plan lacked some efficiency, It precisely failed at the point where I needed it, even though the warranty has not expired. The site responsible for maintaining the warranty claim where you are redirected and forced to jump through hoops(looking not only for a serial number that can be easily found but also for a model number that neither the order confirmation nor the package itself clearly supplies) only to be mystified at your case suddenly being closed. I may have missed some small print in the manual where it stated how the warranty is very conditional and what damage is not covered, so hopefully you guys will read it more carefully and avoid my disappointment with it. The only pro of this plan I can think of is it being inexpensive.
