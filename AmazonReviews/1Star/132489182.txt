This is actually a cardboard pick with a thin layer of leather glued to each side.  When you pluck a string with it, it in no way sounds like you have plucked the string with your finger.  In an attempt to salvage something from this, I took the leather off and glued it to one of my Wedgie rubber picks.  The Wedgie pick actually does a good job of simulating the sound of picking a string with your finger.  However, the Wedgie wears away pretty quickly and leaves rubber powder all over your instrument.  The sound of my modified pick with the leather glued to the rubber Wedgie is pretty good, and hopefully it will wear better than the straight Wedgie pick.  The people who make this need to get together with the Wedgie people and put their leather covers on the the Wedgie picks instead of on cardboard picks.
