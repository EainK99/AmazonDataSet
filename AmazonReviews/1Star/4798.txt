I bought these for my music studio.  Within the first week one of them broke.  I thought it was an anomaly.  All 6 of them are broken now.<br /><br />The problem is pretty simple.  They're made of cheap plastic.  When you turn any of the locking points (as is necessary of any mic stand), the plastic inserts simply crumble.  Unless you are purchasing these so you can whip small children with them, a la Catholic nuns, do not waste your money with these.  They're an inexpensive 6-pack for a reason.
