Worthless piece of garbage since the DC 9V battery adapter piece that is supposed to come with the pedal (to get it to work) was not included.  To add insult to injury, after informing them of the missing piece, Amazon replaced the pedal and the second one came without the above adapter as well!  Unbelievable...they should sell with a warning to consumers that only collectors of useless junk should purchase the item; at least that would be truth in advertising.
