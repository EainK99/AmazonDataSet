It has been 5 hours and I still don't have the system up and running. Navigating between driver updates, coordinating between ILock, Avid and Pro Tools is a nightmare! Now I'm trying to install Pro Tools and the software downlaoded from the site is missing files! It was all in a zip folder, how can it be missing files?!<br />Stay away from this set up!!!!!<br />I'm truly sorry I went with this. You get what you pay for. To save $150 I went with this and wasted 5 hours of my life. Not to mention it's about to cost me a new laptop because I'm about to smash this one!<br />Cant remember the last time I was so frustrated!!!!<br />The previous reviews were obviously posted by employees of this product trying to flog off more of this JUNK, hard to navigate software.
