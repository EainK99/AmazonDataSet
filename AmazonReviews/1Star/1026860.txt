I perform solo and wanted to provide my own rhythm.  This looked like a neat idea, but failed, utterly.  It's a hollowed out block of wood with a guitar pickup wedged up against the top with a piece of foam.  The sensitivity was so horrible as to make it un-useable.  It was a gamble, and I lost.  You will too, if you buy one.
