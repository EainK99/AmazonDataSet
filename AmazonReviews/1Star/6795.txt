NOT AS PICTURED!!!<br /><br />Amazon/Seller identifies this item as the one I purchased previously.  The picture was of the item I purchased.  I reordered this item on August 24, 2015 and the bench sent is NOT AS PICTURE.  It is definitely not as sturdy, not as heavy and the padded seat is not a rectangular box with seams on the top and bottom (the material was placed over the foam and stapled to the bottom without seams - therefore, without the same support.)
