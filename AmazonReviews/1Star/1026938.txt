I bought this item from him showing it was good in stock. The following morning the order was cancelled as being out of stock! I couldn't buy another one because he put an authorization on my account for the amount of the purchase! OUT OF STOCK! Why did he put an authorization! Spent almost 2 hours on the phone with Amazon and the Bank trying to clear this up!
