Ordered this to put a few electric guitars and a bass in to save room in my studio room. Just got it and was assembling it, and it broke before I even got it all together. I put it on its side to tighten a screw and the weld joint just evaporated, rendering the stand useless. I hadn't even put a guitar into the stand yet! The weld joints are so ridiculously flimsy that I would absolutely not trust this with any guitars that are worth more than the strings you've put on them. I plan on getting a refund and ordering a stand that will actually do the job and protect my guitars.
