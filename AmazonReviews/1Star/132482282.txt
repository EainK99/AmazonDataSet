My son bought one of these for me a year ago and I finally got around to using it a couple of weeks ago.  I didn't have the gain problem that others have experienced.  My problem is that it doesn't work at all.  I tried installing the driver and the installer quit because it couldn't run on windows 8.  checked the web site for a fix and found a driver.  I installed it according to the instructions (although I don't understand why I have to effectively disable my speakers in order to use a microphone) and it didn't work.  At the bottom of the instruction page I found a statement that if the letters \\"USB\\" weren't on the microphone, I would have to install driver \\"B\\" before doing the Windows 8 installation of the driver.<br /><br />That leaves the question as how to install driver \\"B\\" if the installer refuses to install it?<br /><br />It makes a dandy doorstop, though.<br /><br />I think I'll get another microphone from a different company and remember not to buy anything this company sells.  Ever.
