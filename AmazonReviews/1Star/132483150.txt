I bought this as 12 string guitars require a strong capo. It has four plastic sleeves to put on to catch the high octave string of each pair of EADG strings.They are difficult to fit but the problem is when the Capo is moved you never close it in exactly the same position, leading to fret buzz. This is a FLAWED DESIGN, impractical and a waste of anyone's money. I have never given a bad review before but these Capos may be fine for a 6 String but are useless for 12 string Guitars. Stay Away.
