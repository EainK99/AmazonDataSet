The guitar arrived unplayable. The B and E strings rattled so much it sounded like an old blues recording from the '40s. The guitar technician I took it to said the only solutions were to raise the action, or to reset the neck. Not just raising the action a little, but between an 1/8th to a 1/4 of an inch, which would make it unplayable except for slide. And resetting the neck would be $200-$300. For a brand new instrument?<br /><br />The sad thing is that this is a well made guitar; quality components well assembled. It's just an unworkable design. It's going back ASAP!<br /><br />Do not buy one of these!
