Ordered the case and it came damaged so badly that it looked like it have been run over by a vehicle. the end of the case had a two inch opening when the case was in closed and locked position. Wow? The packaging is not adequate to protect the high performance travel case!?! Returned the case and ordered a second time.  The case once again came UPS and it was damaged again.  The case wass bent and did not properly seal when in the closed position.  Packaging was torn and looked like it was at the bottom pile of heavier boxes and or mis-handled.  I was then stupid enough to be talked into ordering a third time using Fed-Ex and guess what, the third case came damaged  again.  The packaging material is not adequate to protect this heavy duty travel case.  How could it survive being checked on a plane, as advertised? The aluminum track, at the point of closer, does not align side to side or up and down, when in the closed position.  I will look elsewhere for a top quality case to protect my expensive guitars.
