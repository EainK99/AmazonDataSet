After using this product 4 times for about no more than two hours each it will not function anymore. When i plug it into the wall it will sometimes give me a quick flash of like and then nothing and other times it will just give me nothing at all. It did look very cool while it worked but if they are all like this it is a waste of money. I don't know if mine was defective or if they all have this issue but i didn't quiet get my estimated 60,000 hours of use ha! Would change to 5 stars if i had it switched out for one that worked more than two days.
