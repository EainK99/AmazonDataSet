First thing I have noticed after I gotten these was that the main  material used to build these headers is plastic, so I thought; what have I gotten my self into, but on second thought after I've used them for the first time I changed my mind.... for the price They cost I was quite satisfied with overall sound they produced. Everything would be great only this piece of *** broke after a second time I used it. I mean the cable slot located on the bottom of left speaker broke. I don't know what and how it happened. Like I said poorly made, a little to much base and they could have had better sealers around the ears.<br /><br />So, that's that, 60$ in the garbage.<br />This is a no buy product, if you're looking to spend less than a 100$ on Headphones don't bother yourself's,<br />If you wan't a good product for years to come, it has got to cost you.
