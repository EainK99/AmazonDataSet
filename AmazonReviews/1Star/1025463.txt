Nice looking design but the zippers are below dollar store standards. Mine came broken. Look at the pictures: the back zipper won't zip  and if you are wondering, yes, that's a huge piece of trim overlapping the front zipper in the second picture. On a positive note, they fully refunded my money on the same day I returned this item.
