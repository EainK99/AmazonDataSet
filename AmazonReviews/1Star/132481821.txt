PLEASE DON'T BUY.VERY CRAPPY!! It types excessively. When your trying to key in 1 letter it types about 10 letters, so I'm always deleting and trying to correct the word. I was trying to delete 1 letter and it deleted the whole word. Its tooooooooo small for one thing and I would not suggest this to anyone. When I reached the provider for a refund it was almost like they didn't believe what I was saying. They also wanted to to reship them the product so they can test it and if they see the problem they will refund asap. I don't care if they research the problem, who's to say it will do the same thing to them. I think I'll have to take further measures with ABLE Provider to get a simple $12.00 back.
