Dangerous and defective.  This unit squeals LOUDLY and pops when you turn it on, forcing you o rip the headphones off your head.  It also has a persistent hiss and squeal coming through the phones regardless of whether it is plugged in, or position of controls.  A cheap, horrible Chinese piece of junk.  Don't waste your time.
