I just received the bench, and upon taking it out of the box, it seemed decent. Once I removed the plastic wrap to inspect it further, the sticker on the bottom of the seat caught my eye. It stated that the materials that the bench was made out of are know to &#34;cause cancer, birth defects, and other illnesses.&#34; I am not going to use this bench. It's going back to the manufacturer. Pronto!!!
