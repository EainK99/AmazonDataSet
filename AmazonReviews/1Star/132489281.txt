I bought this on sale in November 2011.<br /><br />Big.  Reminds me of the Big Boy dropped on Hiroshima.  Well, just exaggerating.<br /><br />It plugged in and worked on my Mac without any trouble.<br /><br />I used it to send in some contributions to a podcast.  The podcast editor commented I was sending in noisy recordings with what she called a hum from the system.<br /><br />Have to say, I didn't hear it.  But I can say that even with the rubber base on the Yeti, it did pick up and transmit any motion I made on my desk, like moving the mouse or direction arrows on the keyboard so I could advance my script down the monitor.  Maybe a towel or some other insulating material would have fixed that problem?<br /><br />But a few weeks ago our janitorial staff jostled the Yeti, and the USB Plug in the Mic broke.<br /><br />There's no apparent non-destructive way to open it.<br /><br />The **** thing weighs a ton, so was it worth trying to send to Blue for repair?  I've certainly found that my cost to ship stuff is a whole lot more than Amazon Prime!<br /><br />Hmmm.<br /><br />Did find a website where a disgruntled owner reported the USB plug was attached directly to the chipset inside the Yeti, and his just snapped off the chipset.  He also mentioned there was NO slack in the wire between the input plug and the chip.  Meaning, as happened to mine, a very slight side pull would wreck it.<br /><br />My suggestion: buy a different Mic, buy a different brand.
