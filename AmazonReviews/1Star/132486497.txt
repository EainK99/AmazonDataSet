I just tuned it up and hit a couple of chords, it does not play correctly. I will be sending it back. If you want a cheap guitar, go to your local music store and try one of theirs. At least you know it will play properly. I have 30 years of music behind me and bought this for my 2 year old. It's not even worth it for him to bang on. The action is so high it changes the tuning when you play a chord. don't waste you time on this one, spend another 20 bucks on a real playing guitar.
