I bought this &#34;mute&#34; so that my daughter could practice her saxophone in her room without feeling as though it was too loud. This mute does not change the sound of the instrument at all. We were both very disappointed by this mute and instead we will head to the local store and have them demonstrate the mutes that they have for sale. I did not expect the saxophone to be quiet, but I did expect there to at least be a perceivable difference. This was a waste of my money.
