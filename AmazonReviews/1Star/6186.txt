when I initially got this ocarina I was so happy, but then I joined the Facebook chapter of the Ocarina Network and found out it was a poorly made ripoff of the ceramic 12 hole LOZ replica made by STL. The sound quality is good but no effort went into making sure it was properly tuned.<br /><br />If you want a shiny Christmas ornament, and not a practical instrument, then by all means this is the ocarina for you.
