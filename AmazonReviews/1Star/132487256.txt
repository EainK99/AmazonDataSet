This pedal is a no go in my experience.  Within ten minutes of playing through it, my mind was firmly determined to return the pedal immediately.  The pedal undoubtedly sucks up more than a fair bit of volume and tone from your input signal. I play through a pedal board consisting of two delay stations(boss and line 6), electro-harmonix holy grail reverb, tuner, equalizer, and volume pedal.  It's to be expected that running through so many pedals \\"colors\\" your original guitar tone, imparting at least a little bit of noise into your signal. That being said, nothing else in my board diminishes my tone as unfavorably as the behringer did when engaged.  I found all 4 settings (2 tremolo, and 2 pan settings) to be clunky and no where near the smooth, spatial wash sound I was seeking in a basic tremolo pedal.  I used to own the standard Boss Tremolo pedal, and it is leagues above and beyond this one in my mind.  Even spending time adjusting the two control knobs (depth and rate) there was no \\"happy medium\\" to be found.  It gives off a very rigid effect, and felt more like a gate pedal to me than a tremolo.  Essentially the cuts in tone that are supposed to create the vibrating tremolo effect felt way too abrupt and noticeably electronic, not smooth or gradual or natural at all, even when slowing the rate and depth.  The old adage \\"you get what you pay for\\" rings true, not always, but certainly in this case.  My advice is to wait two weeks for your next pay check and invest the extra 70 bucks on a much more effective tremolo set up.
