This USB-MIDI interface cannot correctly send sysex messages longer than 128 bytes. If you want to use this cable to back up the patches on your synthesizer, or to do firmware updates, it will not work.<br /><br />It's disgraceful that Alesis sells a product in 2015 that does not correctly handle the MIDI specification from 1983.<br /><br />I'm the author of an app that sends and receives MIDI system exclusive (sysex) messages. Many of my users have purchased this cable and encountered problems, and trying a different cable fixes their problems. (Avoid the cheap &#60;$10 cables, because they tend to have similar problems.)
