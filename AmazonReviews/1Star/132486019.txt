This system would not play any of our homemade CD&G discs which was crucial- since we have about 200 songs that were previously purchased and played great on a little $50 machine. The screen was lined and pixelated to the point you could not read the words.  They direct you to a web-site to purchase your own music- but they have very poor selection and the software they require you to use would not work- ended up having to open a dispute to get a refund for that as well.  I would not recommend.
