First, it took way too long to receive item; esp. when shipping not free! It is exactly how it looks; however, after further research on &#34;sound blocking/reduction&#34; I find out this stuff is absolutely worthless in that category. And after I got it &#34;mounted&#34; I was stunned that NO sound was blocked or reduced! It comes with NO product information, no mounting materials or recommendations. It's going to storage. Hopefully, there'll be a use for it someday.
