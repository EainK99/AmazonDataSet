Not reliable at all!<br /><br />Go Behringer, seriously. I wish I had been smarter when making my purchase.<br /><br />I really should have gone with my gut and not go with this speaker. I wanted something at fairly reasonable price for a sub and heard these live in action as was blown away. When it works its great but that is the problem. I have used this for 2 gigs and am fairly anal about keeping the levels at around 12pm and never close to peaking. Rolled it to my 3rd gig and the thing wouldn't even power up. A power supply problem perhaps? This is super frustrating when you have only had this less than six months and now have to scramble to find an authorized repair shop. At least Mackie provides a 3 year warranty (seriously? they must know their products will go out early) but should I really have to deal with this 3 months later?
