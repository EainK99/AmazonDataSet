I purchased this for my 8yo son to take guitar lessons.  The case is cheaply made therefore it didn't last more than 2 months before it started to tear.  It's of poor plastic material.  My son only carries his guitar to and from home and school twice a week so it shouldn't have started to tear that soon. The chord didn't last more than 2 months as well before that started to fray and I had to purchase a new one at a local store.  The amplifier completely died at my son's last concert of the school year.  This was only about 8 months into it.  I emailed about the amplifier and was told it is past the return policy.  There was nothing they would do. My son now 9 takes care of his guitar.  It's only used for practice and concerts.  Very disappointed this product didn't last more than 1 year.  I do not recommend this product if you want it to last.
