The turntables great but nothing on Amazon said it needed a transformer, coming from the US. I should have known this. The motor burned out as soon as I plugged it in rendering it useless. I subsequently bought another one from Littlewoods and Ill keep the ruined one for spares. A bit more information on products would be useful because this mistake cost me €150.
