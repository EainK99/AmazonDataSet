Had to exchange the first package because the remote didn't change the colors of the lights for most of the buttons. The second package worked great for two days till I had them on for a little while and the ac adaptor started to get really hot and smell like it was burning. I'm afraid it's a fire hazard :( and I also found out that my tv remote changes the colors as I try to flip through channels.
