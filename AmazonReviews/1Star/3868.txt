Plugged it in, registered it, downloaded and installed the drivers, tested it out, everything seemed fine. Five minutes later the lights started blinking and it started making clicking sounds. The computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. Tried reinstalling the driver, and restarting the computer to no avail. I've searched for the problem and the only thing I've found is that if you have an AMD processor you need to either use a 3.0 usb slot or download a certain driver on their site. But I don't have AMD so that can't be the problem. I've emailed them and have yet to receive a response but I will say, if they manage to help me fix the problem and it turns out to somehow be my fault I'll edit the review and give it the appropriate rating.
