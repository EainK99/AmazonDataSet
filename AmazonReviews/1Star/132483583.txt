I thought this TKL will fit the mid-depth bowl ovations as advertised (it states 'TKL 8358-0 Zero Gravity Ovation Mid/Deep Guitar Case').  But it appears it only fits certain ovations.  I have an Ovation CA24S-CCB Acoustic-Electric and the guitar body will NOT fit into the case at all.<br /><br />So this TKL looks like it's diff't than maybe the actual Ovation 8358 Mid/Deep case.  I don't have the means to compare.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to return the case back.<br /><br />Update 10/10/13:  just want to say that the seller Go-DPS was very prompt and professional.  I got my full return within 10 days.
