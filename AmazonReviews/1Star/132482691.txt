Difficult to keep in tune.  For some reason these strings continue to change and I found myself constantly having to tune the guitar every 10 minutes.  Not because it was slightly off, but because they would get way way out of tune.  Never had this issue with other brands, usually only had slight variation for a day and then they would stay solid.  Not these, wont buy again.
