First off when I ordered these I knew I was going to get cheap sticks... Man was I right! Not only did they only send me only one pair (instead of 12 pair like the ad said) but the sticks I got were far from straight! Which I thought was funny seeing how their packaging prided themselves on straight sticks..... Long story short if u want to save $ on sticks just go out in your back yard and rip some small branches off a tree they will probably be just as good!
