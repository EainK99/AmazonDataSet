Avoid this cheaply made piece of trash. For $400 dollars less you can get a cheap Chinese violin that will at least hold the strings without the tail piece blowing off your face. The finish is horrible it looks like 5 year old spray painted the thing, and the wood is split where the 1/4&#34; jack plate is screwed into the body. It looks like there's no reinforcement behind the plug so who knows how long that would last without getting ripped out of the violin. $500 may be cheap for a violin but I would still expect better quality for this price range. As for the sound I can't comment on the because the loop that holds the tail piece on blew out before I could even tune the thing. The bow however seems pretty good I tried it on my other violin and it sounds great. If you do try out this violin make sure you wear some eye protection you may loose an eye.
