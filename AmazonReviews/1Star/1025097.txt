This is actually a 4 Star piece of hardware and not my first Line 6 product. My application is home recording with Pro Tools, all projects are 44.1 khz 24 bit, nothing fancy. My Roland and Digitec effects pedals support 44.1 khz letting me use the Macs USB interface keeping everything digital (New School).<br /><br />The FX100 ONLY supports 48 khz 24 bit on a Mac. Under Windows or even on my iPad, 44.1 khz and several higher rates are available. The Line 6 literature confirms this, but their Support Site Forum as well as a Tech Support person say that 44.1khz &#34;should&#34; also be available. IT IS NOT.<br /><br />This is a great product and fortunately has Balanced audio outputs so the analog recording quality is excellent (Old School). The 1 Star rating was only to get the attention of Mac users who can't accommodate the 48 khz ONLY situation. Common sense says adding the lower rate should be a no-brainer and maybe Line 6 will offer better support to Mac users in the future.<br /><br />Until then MAC USERS.....BEWARE.....
