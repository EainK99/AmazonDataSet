This has to be the worst experience I've ever had with a product purchased from amazon. I ordered this guitar thinking it would live up to the images and description, alas it did not. Due to lack of customer reviews I had no clue what I was getting into. The guitar came in a flimsy, broken down, ill fitting box that and when I opened it up I found a guitar that was broken where the neck meets the body. Not only did I find this fatal flaw but I also found cobwebs and a ton of dust along with scratches and dents. It looked as if the guitar was sitting in a warehouse without any sort of cover constantly being moved and tossed around. I am disgusted and appalled. I've tried numerous ways to find the contact number so I can talk to the company that sells this product because returning it is not enough at this point. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY EVER.
