Because it's made of seatbelt material, it has almost no friction.  So unless you hold tightly with both hands at all times, the strap causes the guitar to slide all over the place.  Apparently some people like that, but I like a strap to hold a guitar nicely balanced for me, so i don't waste energy trying to keep the guitar in line.
