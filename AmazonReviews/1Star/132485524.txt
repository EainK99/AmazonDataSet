We own other Levy straps and they are good. This one looks and feels cheaply made with low quality materials.  The picture shown is not the actual product recieved. Levy logos not printed on underside of strap and the ends are made of a stretch polyester that feels like it would scratch instrument as well as stretch to not stay on. Very disappointed after such a long wait for it to ship. Sending back within 5 min of opening package.  This looks like a poor reproduction of there usual quality.
