Not even close. The propaganda on the Fender package says that these are &#34;PURE VINTAGE parts fashioned using original machinery and dies...none have more pure Fender authenticity, blah, blah, blah&#34;....I can't even finish this.<br /><br />These corners that Fender is foisting on us via their dealers could not be more wrong. They look NOTHING like the originals, the holes don't line up, the tabs are wrong, they're chrome instead of nickel and the screw holes are NOT countersunk.<br /><br />I am showing a photo of the difference. No point in sending these back - the postage would be more than the refund. BUT, if you are restoring a vintage Fender amp, like I am, look elsewhere. There are other places to get the correct part. Use Google and you'll find them.
