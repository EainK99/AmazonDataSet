I had the ION Block Rocker Portable Speaker System with AM/FM Radio by ION Audio before but I sent it to my Mom and bought this Pyle PRO PCM system. Sadly besides the terrible sound quality, the unit failed to charge after only 2 months of use. Though the Pyle Pro Unit is a lot nicer looking and flashier, I would advice you all to go with the ION PA system. The sound was much better and the unit felt very solid.<br /><br />It cost me $60 to ship the unit back. Its been almost two weeks and I still have not heard back from Pyle customer support. Be warned. Meanwhile I have to pay them $15 to ship this unit back to me. Frankly I will prefer they just return my money back to me but we shall see. stay tuned.
