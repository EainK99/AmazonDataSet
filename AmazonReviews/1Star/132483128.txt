I bought this as an intro to wireless audio in video recording. I might as well have used a megaphone. The static and interference at 6 feet was terrible. If I did not know wireless was capable, I would have given up hope to ever recording in that manner. The battery still works in my mouse, but the Pyle-Pro is in the Waste pile!
