The TRAKTOR 2.6 software is NOT included in the box. There is NOT a $50 evoucher that I could find on Native Instruments incredibly COMPLICATED and SLOW website. I registered this product and got NOTHING off the internet. At a minimum, you will have to pay an additional $90 for Traktor Pro 2. I feel MISLED right now because I thought I was going to get traktor pro 2.6 with this and I did not, thanks a lot Native Instruments.
