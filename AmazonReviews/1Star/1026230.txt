I have always used Ortofon cartridges and never had one have the needle fall out of a stylus. I still have other Ortofon cartridges with the original stylus' in tact after years of heavy use. This product was purchased only 40 days ago with very light use. I hadn't even taken it out of the house! The needle fell right out onto the record. This makes me want to switch to SHURE almost immediately!! So sad I flushed 60$ :(
