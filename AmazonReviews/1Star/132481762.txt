I order this item for my son back on August, that's the only thing that he ask for his birthday.  So when he found this he was so happy and then the waiting game began.  Well, it's now the last day of September and the item never got here.  I started writing to the vender but never got an answer from him.  I finally had no option but to contact Amazon, and now I'm so glad I did because they finally gave me some answers.  I can not put in to words how disappointed I am with this vendor.  If this item was for me, I would probably not complain about this guy being so cruel, but it was for my baby, it really broke my heart to see the disappointment on his face.
