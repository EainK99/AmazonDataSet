Broken out of the box!!!! Every negative review is spot on!!!! this is my very first review on Amazon, I am sad to say it is a bad one!!!  Keep your money!! The ball socket is the most piss poor design I've ever seen, fell on the ground before i could even clamp it to my guitar!!  I should know better by now, if you want quality, spend the money!! if &#34;snark&#34; wants to stay in buisness then they better provide a roll of duct tape with every unit!!!!!  If you enjoy burning money in your free time then this is the tuner for you!!!! but if you value your guitar and what you do as an artist, then place your finger in your b hole!!! might find a better pitch perfect sound from there!!!!!!
