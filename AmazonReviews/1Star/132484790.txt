I can't really comment on what I like/dislike about the Clarke Celtic Tin Whistle because when I received the whistle, it had two distinct bends in it. It was shipped in a bubble-wrap envelope, which I think may have been responsible for the two bends in the whistle. I'm a novice with the whistle, but I'm quite sure the &#34;noises&#34; that come from it are not the melodic &#34;notes&#34; it was made to create.<br /><br />What customers should know:<br />-It is a cheap tin whistle, painted with green paint.<br />-It is not shipped appropriately so expect to receive damaged merchandise.<br />-Though it's cheap, it may work for you - if you're lucky enough to receive it without the bends.<br />-Yes, I did just what Amazon wanted because I simply kept it instead of going to the trouble/expense of returning it.<br />-My advise, don't make the same mistake I made. Keep your money and shop locally so you can see what you're getting.
