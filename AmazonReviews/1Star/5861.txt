Worst product ever.  The keys are probably the worst feeling keys I've ever played on, and the comparable M-Audio miniKeystation has much better keys.  Playing softly is incredibly difficult and just feels bad.  However, that is not the worst thing about this keyboard.  The worst thing is that it seems to send and overflow MIDI data even when idle.  Perhaps I got a bad unit, but once was enough for me.  With this plugged in, my audio interface did not operate correclty and I would experience random silence, and inoperable VSTs.  Once I changed this with a different keyboard, those problems went away.  If you're looking for a good, cheap, MIDI controller I would recommend the M-Audio 32mini Keystation, or the iRIGs Pro Keys that comes with Sampletank 3.  Both are more expensive, but the M-Audio keyboard works flawlessly and the iRIG is an excellent value as it comes with Sampletank 3.
