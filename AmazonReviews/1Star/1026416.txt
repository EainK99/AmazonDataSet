As you know, if you are looking at this review, this is a power supply for a professional Sennheiser wireless mic receiver.  As such, it should be built to professional levels, using professional quality components. Unfortunately, it is not, which no doubt is why you are reading this looking for a replacement.  After a year and a half of occasional, gentle road use (2-3 times a week), one of the plastic clips that holds the US-type plug onto the unit broke, and the plug fell off. The wire used for the cord is SO THIN that it frayed and broke at both ends. The strain reliefs used at both the plug and the jack ends are far too strong for the diminutive, thin wire used, so the wire frays and breaks immediately outside the strain reliefs.  I ended up having to do an emergency on-site fix with Scotch tape and Krazy Glue in order to get it to work through a show. The replacement, now only a few months old, is already showing signs of wear. I'm planning to buy yet ANOTHER replacement to carry along as a reserve spare, which is ridiculous.  I expect more from Sennheiser.
