I wish I could be as positive as others, but unfortunately for me I can't. I ordered this amp. and then went and bought a used Washburn electric guitar. I got the amp. and plugged in. The amp. wasn't working right and I then noticed there was a dent in it and 2 of the 3 boxes it was packed in were dented also.<br /><br />I returned this amp. for exchange with the same model and when I got that one I went and bought a new Ibanez GRG. I got the guitar at Advance music and while there I tried the guitar and new cord on the Peavey Vypyr 40 watt and both worked fine. When I got home I plugged into the 2nd amp. and to my dismay and disappointment it did the same thing as the first.<br /><br />Only the clean amplifier seemed to work right, all the rest kept cutting out or phasing out and sounded pretty horrible. Two amps. two bad amps. in a row. I also had my friend come over and plug his guitar and cord into it and it did the same. I then plugged my guitar and cord into his amp. and it worked fine. I actually tried to find something I was doing wrong, but after several connection checks, internet searches and Youtube views and having owned amps. before and being a guitar player of many years I could only deduce that the problem was with both amps.<br /><br />I think maybe I just hit on a line of flawed products that obviously weren't tested after production or before shipment or they wouldn't have shipped them.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say about this particular experience with Amazon is that both the exchange and return were pretty smooth with no hassle and that shipment in both dropping off and pick up were better than timely. I'll most likely get this amp. at the local music store so I can test it before bringing it home.
