This is a horrible product! The latency when I use this is so bad I can not play or record anything. I downloaded the driver for it and the asio driver and spent hours adjusting sound on my PC with no difference. I barely turn the volume knob on my bass and it sounds distorted so I purchased a more expensive adapter and it works fine so I know it was this product. Do not buy this, spend a few extra dollars and get a better one that actually works!
