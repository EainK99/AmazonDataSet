If you need a case, then I would go ahead and buy this item. The actual harmonicas are terrible. The quality of the sound is just horrendous. Most of the harmonicas had several holes with the reeds messed up. Some of them will correct themselves as you play them more, but overall, do not waste your money on buying these if you intend to play them. I immediately regretted the decision after playing them the first time.
