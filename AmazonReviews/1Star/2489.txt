Let me save you a lot of headache and hours of frustration. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. I bought this mixer from amazon and was excited to plug it in and try it out with my Behringer C-1 Microphone. This seemed like a cheap alternative to an audio interface and I liked the built in compressor. However, when I tried to record, there was a loud hissing noise present in all my recordings. I tried everything. Setting the gain up properly, resetting the levels, installing the driver Behringer recommends, chaging the settings. I even unplugged the mic and listened on headphones. With no mic plugged in, there is still a hiss. I looked online and was sad to discover that this is a common problem with Behringer mixers and THERE IS NO REMEDY. I tried all the suggestions and none of them work. Now, let me tell you how severe this problem really is. I unplugged from the USB port. The hiss is still in the headphones. I backed all the gain down and only turned on the Main Mix. Still there. I am disgusted with Behringer and will avoid Behringer mixers in the future. I will just have to shell out another 100 bucks and buy an audio interface. Save your money. Don't purchase Behringer USB mixers. And don't take my word for it. Google &#34;Behringer USB Mixer Hiss&#34; and see how many results pop up.
