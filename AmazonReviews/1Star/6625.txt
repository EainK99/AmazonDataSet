I had the metronome and at first loved it, but within a month it acted like the battery was dying (even though it was fully charged).  None of the buttons worked to let me adjust it, and it would get so quiet I couldn't hear it.  I ordered a second one after it broke, and the EXACT same thing happened to the second one as well.<br /><br />Would not suggest that anyone buy it.
