We bought this Clarinet and with in a week one of the levers would not close to cover one of the holes.  The sound was only fair to begin with and this problem made it unplayable.  We let the merchant know and they agreed to a refund.  It took forever to hear anything from them and then when we did, they had repaired the instrument and sent it back to us.  We had already agreed to buy a used clarinet from someone else of higher quality and so we called the merchant again to let them know that we wanted a refund not a repair.  They said it was their prerogative to repair or refund and they chose repair.  When we demanded for our money back, they had a fit and said that we had not let them know in time that there was a problem with the instrument and so they would not refund the price.  When we told them we had the emails to show we were in the time frame, they said that they would only give us back 80%.  We figured that was better than nothing and we agreed.  We waited for another 6 weeks and after calling them again they finally gave us our 80%.  They were nasty to deal with, look for another dealer!
