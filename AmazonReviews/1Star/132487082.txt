This violin (and any of the \\"instruments\\" on this site) are not worth it.  They are not put together according to NAfME standards, hence they will not stay in tune properly, the strings are too far from the fingerboard, the bridge isn't carved to match the angle of the fingerboard/nut, the bow is a piece of garbage.  Do yourself a favor and got to an actual instrument dealer or an instrument website like Southwest Strings or Shar if you really want to learn to play an instrument.  I am an orchestra teacher, and I have many students with instruments like these, and they cause so many problems.  The students become frustrated because of their poorly constructed instrument.  If you truly want your child to participate in learning a musical instrument, get him or her a properly adjusted instrument, it makes a huge difference.  Southwest Strings and Shar have good student model instruments starting in the low $100s.  PLEASE don't get any of these instruments!  They are HORRIBLE!!!!!  I had to give a star rating...wanted to give zero stars.
