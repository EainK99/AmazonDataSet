I have an Aiwa vinyl player, it fits right but only play well part of the vinyl. When goes to the last track, start to sound distorted, like yours speakers wire are not well connected or like some dirt stick to the needle. I don't understand why, is money wasted. It seems that the needle is thin and weak, causing this such distortion because needle curves a little and only one speaker sound ok and the other with the problem mentioned. To the factory: please check this one out and make it right.
