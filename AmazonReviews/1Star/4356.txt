This is a marketing scam....this is NOT an $1100+ guitar.  The PRS SE model guitars all cost $750 direct from PRS or any reputable dealer....not anywhere near $1100+.  This is NOT a good deal...only a scam.  The PRS SE guitars are fantastic, just dont' be fooled into thinking you are getting an $1100 guitar for $800.
