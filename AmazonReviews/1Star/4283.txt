Audio on these units drops out, hisses, pops, clips, ETC. had to return and purchased the following model to replace the 2 units I bought:<br /><br />*** PylePro PDWM3400 Premier Series UHF Microphone System with 2 Body-Pack Transmitters, 2 Headsets and 2 Lavalier Mics. Additionally, since the reviews on the PylePro PDWM3400 showed that the mics on shipped stock were of poor quality... I purchased the following items to replace the mics included... Deluxe Lavalier Lapel Clip-on Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone for Apple Iphone, Ipad, Ipod Touch, Android and Windows Smartphones by Miracle Sound.<br /><br />The reviews on the MIRACLE SOUND lavs were glowing and I figured I would buy the better mics to pair with the PylePro PDWM3400 Premier Series UHF Microphone System. I like to hedge my bets when I see bad reviews.
