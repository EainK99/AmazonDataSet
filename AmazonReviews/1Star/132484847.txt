Rosin was cracked when it arrived - that I can deal with since it's only a $2 item<br /><br />The zipper on the front carrying case wasn't sewed in correctly, the whole zipper just comes out if you accidentally reach the end of the zipper.<br /><br />The violin build quality is bad, I didn't purchase this for myself but for a son of a relative, so I don't have the slightest idea on how violin works. But towards the bottom of the violin there are four metal clips that holds on to the strings, but one of the clips were bent and I had to bend it back into place.<br /><br />Normally I would return the product due to these defects, but we had no choice but to keep it since the music class had already started and we don't want the kid missing out on the lessons.<br /><br />And here I thought I would be avoiding a bullet buy getting something with a better rating than that $60 Mendini.
