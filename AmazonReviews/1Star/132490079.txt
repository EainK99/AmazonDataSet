Purchased this unit to help with Mic-ing up the Officiant and Groom for Wedding Ceremonies.  After 3 uses, I will not use this unit again.  Both channels continuously clip - even though I am in direct sight, low volume levels and less than 40 feet away.  Very Frustrating and Embarassing.  I thought I was doing something wrong, so I gave it another chance.<br /><br />Wrong Choice..!!<br /><br />Also, their customer service is a joke.  They kept on trying to sell me other accessories.  They wanted to sell me another body pack instead of replacing what I purchased.  Oh, I would have to pay for the shipping.  I called twice and got different prices for the same product.  Unreal..<br /><br />Do not waste your money..!!!!
