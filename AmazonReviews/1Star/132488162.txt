I'm a novice harp player but when my trusty marine band harp was damaged I needed a quick replacement. I read some of the reviews on these and thought, well, maybe I could just make it work until I had the money to sink into something better. I mean, the case is worth the cost of this anyway so,... When they arrived I immediately took to testing them, I pulled out the C which was what my old marine band was. I was actually inspired. It sounded fairly clear so I started bending and it sounded fairly good. Not as good as my marine but definitely usable, what was everyone else complaining about?<br /><br />Then I pulled out the next one. It all went down hill from there. I found the dead spots and leaking air issues so many others posted about. I couldn't bend the F if I wanted to. It literally made no sound if you try to bend it. Several of them let out horrible high pitch trills when trying to bend them and most of the others had dead spots in the high and low notes. The G was completely unplayable. I believe the reed was damaged as I couldn't get any sound from it at all. The only one that seemed to be usable was the C and I can only assume that was just luck. I'm not sure what the though process was here from Hohner. These aren't good enough to be beginner harps. They're little more than plastic toys. I'm giving one star for the carrying case and the decent C harp. Don't buy these. Drop $30 and buy a decent harp. Build your note collection one at a time, you'll be much happier.
