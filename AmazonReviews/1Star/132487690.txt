The bow arrived quicker than expected.  This is a decent bow that is perfect for a student.  So far, it is holding up to daily use.  Update on bow.  After using the bow for about a month, my daughter noticed a few hairs falling out. We thought that this was expected and that a few loose hairs were no big deal.  After a few more episodes of losing  hair while playing, we handed the bow to her teacher and were told that it was a low quality bow.  The bow lasted 4 months.  You get what you pay for.
