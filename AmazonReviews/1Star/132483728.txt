This pedal along with the digital reverb/delay, reverb machine, and compressor/sustainer pedals by Behringer all worked great for the first two day I had them. The second night while using them they all one by one started malfunctioning. They would cut on and off and produce unpleasant sounds. I replaced the batteries thinking although the batteries should last longer than two days perhaps that was the issue (which it was not). I realized I got what I paid for, cheap poor quality pedals. I almost gave these products 2 starts b/c while they were working they sounded fantastic, how ever there is no point in guitar pedals that can't maintain working order after such short time. I didn't handle these pedals roughly nor expose them to any harsh environments that could warrant defective behavior. Simply had them on my carpet floor in front of my amp. These pedals were practically undistinguishable in sound from the higher end pedals they are based on and it was truly a tease to have thought I found a cheaper alternative to them. I will NEVER purchase any products from Behringer after this experience.
