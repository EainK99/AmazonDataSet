All I have to say is Buyer Beware! I ordered a Speaker Soak in June. It arrived - was plugged in and began to smoke! When I unplugged it I heard something rattling around. I contacted Carl-he apologized for the problem-said he would replace it. Well after 3+ months and a dozen emails to him(lots of excuses etc...) I still have not received a replacement. At this point I give up-guess I'm going to lose my 39 dollars. It seems like a super poor business model though because if I can get a couple of people to question the product and and the source I will be losing less money than Carl will be. Hmmmmmmmmmmm?
