Bought 3 of these for our acting studio, and thought we were experiencing a loose connection or something.  But after troubleshooting, have discovered that the built-in mics on our Sony camcorders get sound FAR superior to these mics.  Wasted money.  Wish it wasn't too late to return them for a refund
