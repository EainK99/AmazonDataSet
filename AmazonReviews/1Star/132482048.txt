I got this due to the other great reviews... but the shoulder rest I received was not at all what I expected, it was a really cheap chinese knockoff, was light orange, (not brown), had white feet (not black), and the words vio music were nowhere to be found. The rest had no contour for the shoulder and was very hard.<br /><br />Maybe it's good enough for others, but I'd rather play with nothing rather than this one... doesn't hold a candle to the kun (only other king I've tried)<br /><br />Another problem is it does not adjust to come very low, which is a problem for me with my short neck.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed... c'mon vio music, take some pics of the the shoulder rest you are actually going to send us.<br /><br />Amazon did make returning it easy though, so that's my one positive point.
