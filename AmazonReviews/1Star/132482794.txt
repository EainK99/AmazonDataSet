i bought those for my nephew who is a amateur DJ... one come damage and they make us pay the return fee to replaced, great until then no fair but is ok, but after we pay the return they ship back a used unit at least working but scratched and damaged on the edge, bad package, on the end why they care if they already did the sale... Like another customer said before on the end u are losing u money, the product is not the Big Deal for the headache that is deal with seller
