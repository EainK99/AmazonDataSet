The 50ft version of this cable lasted a grand total of 4 months before the video channel lost connectivity. In that time it was installed in the ceiling of my basement, where it could not get stepped on, rolled over or otherwise moved, and where the temperature is relatively constant. The product description says &#34;lifetime warranty&#34; but the warranty claim site says &#34;403 Forbidden&#34; after one fills out the form and submits.<br /><br />Signal quality was never fabulous, even when new, but you can't expect much from composite video over these kinds of distances. I'll be trying [[ASIN:B00B973WD0 C&E 50 feet Stereo/VCR RCA Cable, 2 RCA (Audio) and RCA RG59 Video]] next in the hopes that the coaxial video channel will last a bit longer and maybe give a better signal.
