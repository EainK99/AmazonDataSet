1) The connection between the led strip and the controller is not a solid connection.  When plugged together, simply touching the connection will cause one or more colors to cut out.  This might have been fixed by taping the two together, but I never bothered trying.<br /><br />2) The blue and green wiring was reversed, so the colors produced did not match the colors on the remote.<br /><br />3) The DIY color adjustment functions didn't do anything.  All the DIY colors are set to white by default, but using the rgb increase/decrease buttons had zero effect.  I might have been willing to work around the first two problems if the DIY had worked at least.<br /><br />I'm working on returning these and don't plan to order a replacement.
