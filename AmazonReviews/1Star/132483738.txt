I spent weeks searching online for the best microphone that balanced ability with quality. I wanted to use this to record vocals for an album and was pleased to see positive reviews and even videos of users using the microphone with great ease in very open environments.<br /><br />That is why I was a little drawn back by the quality I received upon using this microphone for the first time. It was new right out of the box, but when I plugged it in, I noticed a lot of background noise being picked up, which I can expect with a condenser.<br /><br />However, with as much effects put in to the recording and however many recording environments I tried (EVEN A SOUNDPROOF BOOTH) this microphone lent itself to produce awful, cave-like quality that sounded mechanical and very grimy and unnatural. I was very disappointed, especially because so many people seemed to like this one.<br /><br />This is also my 2nd bad experience with a condenser mic (the first being the Samson C01U), making me never want to buy a condenser again (unless I spend $99999999 on one). I shall try dynamic mics from here on out
