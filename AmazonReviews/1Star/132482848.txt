Please, for the sake of your violin, don't get these if you play in an orchestra. I got these because the strings that came with my violin were wearing down. To be honest, I didn't put thought into what strings would be better, I just went with the cheapest. The sound quality is so poor compared to a good set.<br />Also, when I was taking one of the strings out to adjust my bridge, it broke.<br />Pay the extra dollars to get a good set, because if you get this, it'll be waste of time and money. Not to mention patience.
