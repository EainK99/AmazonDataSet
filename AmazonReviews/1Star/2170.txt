I didn't work when I got it. There was no loaded programs, no battery for stored memory, and the card loader wouldn't load those programs that I had. So because I am a electronic technician I decided to try and fix the M1R EX synthesizer module rather than send it back. Ultimately I was able to restore the card loader but it was really in need of replacing. I put a battery in it and all was well for storing the loaded memory. Also the picture that they posted of this unit was not the same one that I received. The unit needed a lot of restoration work before I could look at it with a pleasing eye, but I was able to restore it. This is not they way to do business by lying about the product your are trying to sell and charging way too much for something that they knew didn't work to begin with.
