I was very displeased with the headphones. I bought two sets; One from my wife in one for myself. Well, m Wife's pair only plays out of one earbud and the set that I have won't sustain a solid Bluetooth connection.  I have become so frustrated with both sets of Bluetooth headphones.  At some point I will most likely send the headphones back to get a full refund of my money. If you are reading this I am not an automated reply system I am not someone hired through fiver, I'm just an ordinary person and I would tell you seek out something with them a bit more quality!
