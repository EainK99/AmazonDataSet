This thing looks like it should be great, but it has turned out to be nothing but a piece of junk. I got this bag in and, within a couple of weeks of using it, it started to come apart at the seams on the bottom. Ok, so I returned it and they got me another one. this one managed to last about 5 months before it started coming apart at the seams again. the lesson I'm learning here is that A) apparently Zildjian invests all their time into making great cymbals, not great cymbal bags, and B) you get what you pay for. Next time I will invest more money into a much better bag from another manufacturer.
