Received this 3 hours ago, my 11 Year-old granddaughter very excited to be taking music lesson at school. Bow brokw within 10 minutes, end just popped off. Pegs broke next and bridge does not fit. 2 strings were pre-broken before we even got out of box. The only thing this viola is good for is maybe to hang on a wall and not touch, don't buy it!
