My alesis seemed like a dream come true for my small dance shows I put on.. . Then it started being staticky off and on.  I was totally embarrassed using it the last time for a show as I was getting feedback and static for the whole show.  I tried using it all different ways - plugged - unplugged - with ipod - no ipod - mic - no mic ... no change. It now sits unused out in my garage. I wish it worked as the idea of it is good.  Its a perfect size and great portability.
