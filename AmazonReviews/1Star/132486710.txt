This is a Violin shaped object (VSO) - no-where close to a real violin. It was not tune-able by a suzuki trained teacher - after multiple attempts by her. The bridge kept falling and the tail gut came loose.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is beyond the amazon return window (by 3 days) and we are unable to return such a horribly defective instrument!<br /><br />IF AMAZON or the supplier cares about the review - they should contact me back for resolution... Thanks!
