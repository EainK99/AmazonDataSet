A recently constructed church was provided with a TOA wireless microphone system. After less than a year of use something in the lavalier pack broke and now the system never sounds the same. it sounds scratchy and is constantly clipping not matter how low i turn down the receiver. I tried to get in touch with TOA but they are impossible to get a hold of... bottom line not worth the money.<br />I'll keep trying with TOA to fix the issue although i am not optomistic and write back
