I bought this microphone in June for a Karaoke machine I bought on Amazon.  It worked fine while it lasted. The sound was OK.  But two months later it started acting up and voice would disappear in the middle of singing.  Now it does not make any sound at all.  Waste of money.  When I buy products, I would expect it to be reliable.<br />The microphone that came with the Karaoke machine still works like new no matter what Mic outlet you plug it into, so this is not an issue with connection.
