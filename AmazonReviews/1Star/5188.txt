This reed did not fit my American Clarinet which I did not know when I ordered it.  Their American counterpart is  the best brand of reeds I have ever used. I couldn't give it an excellent because I couldn't use them much to my disappointment.  Perhaps it should say somewhere that it is only for German clarinets and is the wrong size for an American Clarinet.
