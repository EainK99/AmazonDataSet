If you buy a piano bench you want it to last for a while. After 6 months the buttons started to fall off, it looks terrible now. Contacted Amazon who reffered me to the supplier, supplier indicated 90 days warranty. If you go through the hassle to get a piece of furniture like this I would go for better quality or buy it in a store so that you can go back if it does not meet your expectations.
