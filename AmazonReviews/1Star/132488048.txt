This was suppose to be brand new and the box came and it was not the box for the piano, there was no packaging, and the box looked about 10 years old.  The piano did not come with a microphone and was scratched and looked as if it had been used.  Not impressed at all.  I sent it back and ordered a different piano from another seller.
