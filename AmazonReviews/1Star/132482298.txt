I did not receive the &#34;optic&#34; version as ordered but the &#34;tactile&#34; one.<br />It was useless, curled up and left a huge mess on my fretboard when I removed it<br />Perhaps the one with visible lines (i.e.- the one I actually ordered) would<br />have worked better but I suspect it still would have curled.  The only time I<br />have been dissatisfied with something purchased on Amazon.
