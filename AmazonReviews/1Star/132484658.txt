After barely a year of use, the mbox mini hardware stopped being recognized by my Mac.  I tried it on another computer.  I tried several different cables. I tried everything suggested in forums.  I uninstalled and reinstalled and repaired disk permissions.  I tried going to the Avid site, but many of the links are broken and other pages are down for maintenance.  And they charge $40 for a service call.  Mind you, I'm guessing at that. It might be $20; it might be $80.  Their service sales page is very unclear as to which purchase is for a hardware service call.<br /><br />The only positive thing to come out of my experience with Pro Tools and the mbox mini is that I learned to Command Save frequently, thanks to Pro Tools' propensity for crashing, freezing, and otherwise ceasing to work.  So there's that.
