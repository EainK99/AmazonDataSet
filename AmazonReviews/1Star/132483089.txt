The driver disc shipped with the unit refuses to work with any XP machine I try.  I tinkered with my unit for a couple of weeks trying to figure out why no sound would come out of the PA. It turns out that volume controls have to be jacked up more than half way of their travel before sound starts to become audible. I am not to happy with this unit. If I could get my money back I would return it pronto.
