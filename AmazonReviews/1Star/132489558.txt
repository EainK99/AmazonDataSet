Before I begin I would like to state that I understand what this thing is suppose to do. I was not trying to use it in place of monitors. I had two major concerns that made me return this item; one being that it didn't play well with my set up and the other being that I didn't think it was a good referencing tool at all.<br /><br />1)The VRM box worked the first time I installed it. I was using it as the main soundcard. I actually thought that my tunes sounded a little less colored through the VRM box as oppose to how they sound going through my behringer mixer which is how I usually have it set up. If I could say anything positive about this equipment it would be just that; as a soundcard it does sound good and pretty transparent.<br /><br />However, when I started using it solely as a referencing tool via spdif it didn't work at all until I plugged it in to the back of my PC; no idea why. It was fine when it was the main card but not as a secondary. After about 40 min of usage my main soundcard would stop working. I have a Hammerfall 9652 and have NEVER had any problems with it until this thing was plugged in. My main card would emit glitchy popping noises and that's it. I'd have to restart my machine to fix that. No bueno. Tried updating drivers for both cards and nothing changed. For me, that was enough to send it back. On top of that....<br /><br />2) Why would you offer simulations of top of the line monitors if the simulations are no where close to that of those monitors??? Maybe you need the EXACT headphones that they used to test this with but I am using Sennheiser HD 25-1-II's and they did not sound even remotely close to me. I think some people said they sound a bit too &#34;washy&#34; or &#34;reverbed&#34; and I would agree with that.<br /><br />A friend of mine has the Avantones and the Adams' and these replications fell very short of how they sound. I would say that the best settings were the computer speaker settings and the TV settings but honestly if you already have some crappy computer speakers....why not just use those??? I tried A/B ing with the computer speaker settings and even made some drastic adjustments on purpose to hear the changes and could hardly hear a difference. I just don't think they really do what they are suppose to do that well...OR my headphones and set up just don't play well with it.<br /><br />Instead I have ordered a Behringer C50A because what I really want to do is just A/B my tracks and be able to make immediate adjustments with something less impressive than my Mackie 824's. The ultimate test for me is how my tunes sound in my car and i don't think that the VRM box can simulate that...it's not even a setting (although it should be!). Hopefully the C50A will be worth while.<br /><br />I am merely offering my experience with this device. You may have a different one. If you are considering it I'd say give it a shot, you can always send it back if it's not working right. The great thing about Amazon is that they will send someone to pick it up too, you don't even have to drive to the post office. Amazon seriously has the best customer service. Keep it up guys!
