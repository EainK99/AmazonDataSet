Coolest looking BUT the worst product out there. I bought this 2 years ago and probably out of warranty by now. 1. Out of the 2 years it probably worked twice. After initial use it started making ticking, static noise. No matter what I did it wouldn't go away.  Over heats- so hot that the metal chassis changed color. 2. Worst drivers - never worked 3. Worst tech support ever - it's as if they don't exist<br /><br />My experience with MOTU products thus far is no good. I owned the 626mkII (something like that) and I had a bad experience as well. Basically I've wasted too much time on these products from this manufacturer and I would advise you to stay away from it.
