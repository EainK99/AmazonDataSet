I thought that this kit would really help to repair some of the logos on my Sabian cymbals. However, when it was applied, it appeared bumpy and not solid black. The quality is not good. Plus, the marker is jumbo-size, so it's hard to redo series logos. A sharpie looks twice as good and you can get it in a smaller size so you don't have to worry about trying to control a huge marker. The stencils are pretty good quality if you want to just repair the actual Sabian logo of your cymbals. I bought this kit to repair series logos, though, and was not impressed.
