Wow.  What a miserable experience this has been!  My son damaged his 5 month old guitar & it required repair.  I was pleased that I had purchased the SQUARE TRADE warranty.  We took it to a reputable luthier after discussing the situation with no less than 3 Square Trade service assistants by phone.  Got the job done, got the receipt for the $80.00 repair. Then, another round of emails, faxed/scanned receipt 5 times, more phone calls.  Always polite service people but always ignorant and/or knowingly misleading.  We have spent at least 3 hours communicating with Square Trade over the past 2 months. Still don't have check.  They want us to give up I'm sure.  By now, I feel they owe us $80 plus money for time & suffering.  I regret getting the service but now there's a bloody principle involved.  I don't know how Square Trade is for other things, but for guitars, they are on my top ten list of worst companies to deal with.  Now, I'm off to talk to Better Business Bureau--all for a measly $80.  Square Trade--SHAME ON YOU.
