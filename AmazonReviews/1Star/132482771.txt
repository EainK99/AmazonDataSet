I ordered 2 of those strips .<br /><br />As soon as it arrived, I noticed they send only one power supply, one remote control and one module.<br /><br />I tested one strip using the power supply provided and the module. It worked for one hour and the power supply is gone !!!<br /><br />Bottom line , you can buy the same product from dozens of companies. eTopLED is the one to avoid at all costs !!!
