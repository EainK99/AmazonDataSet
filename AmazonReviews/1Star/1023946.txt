Very disappointed.  I paid too much attention to the positive reviews. Anytime you tried to skip a track on a karaoke cd (including the one that came with it), the song would start midway through.  Stopping the cd entirely and restarting did not solve the problem. The CD player is very cheaply made. The lyrics wouldn't show up on the screen half the time.  There was quite a bit of a delay when speaking/singing into the microphone.  It also had a lot of echo, even if the echo feature was turned all the way down.  The only pros is that it's very lightweight and small.
