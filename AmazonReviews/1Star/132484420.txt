Bought this because it was PRIME and I wanted to get the job done.  It took over a week to get here.  So much for 2 day...<br /><br />Then the green and blue channels were swapped from what my other RBG ribbon was so I had to solder up an adapter cable to make the crossover.  Got that done.  If you can use the 5 meters great but trying to make connections even with ribbon connectors is extremely difficult because the copper is really really thin. Really tough to solder too.  Noticed the coating has quite a few bubbles.<br /><br />What really makes me hate it though is after all that work, the Red channel is really dim.  Much dimmer than the other RGB Ribbon attached to the same controller.  Full power on all channels creates a blue green light, not white.  Waste of a weekend day.  Probably will have to rip it out and do it again.<br /><br />Basically it would have been more satisfying to do the project with burning torches and colored tissue paper.
