I bought a pair of these from Music123/Amazon for my little Fender Pro Junior on April 27th, 2015. A couple of days ago my amp started farting and spitting. I figured it couldn't be the tubes since they were less than 4 months old and I only play this amp once or twice a week in my spare bedroom. I started looking up amp repair shops in Austin, but then I decided to put my trusty old Sovteks back in for the heck of it and now the amp sounds great! My JJ EL-84 power tubes work fine but I won't ever buy these again if I can't even get 4 months of use out of them!
