I bought this power supply for my OCD full tone distortion Pedal. I quickly ate through a 9 volt battery and decided to get this based on the recommendation from Guitar center. I got home I I plugged in the power supply to the OCD full tone distortion pedal and instantly I heard an added annoying \\"hum\\" almost a buzz static sound coming from my tube amp. I tried moving the power supply away from everything else and no luck the \\"hum\\" or buzz sound remained. I thought the pedal cost me $127.40 and I didn't buy it to hear \\"hum\\" noise. That being said this product does not do what it is supposed to its going back to guitar center! I will buy the voodoo power supply 2 in the next few months.
