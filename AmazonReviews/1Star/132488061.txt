A couple caveats.  First off, I bought these headphones used.  They were listed as &#34;Like New&#34; with the only visible evidence of use being the lack of a box or manual, and the price was certainly right.  However, upon receipt the item was broken beyond reasonable usability.  I suspect there was an issue with the internal wiring, as I could get some frequencies (albeit garbled), but vocal frequencies were utterly absent from the track unless I twisted the cable near the plug, holding it at an odd angle.  At that point sound came through as normal.  Used or not, this sort of wiring problem is indicative of cheap materials and/or shoddy manufacturing (the same issue is found frequently in &#60; $10 earbuds, in my experience), so there's one strike against these headphones.<br /><br />Now let us ignore the wiring issue for a moment and suppose that the product had arrived in working order.  The sound that I got when the cord was manipulated into a working position was adequate, but nothing spectacular.  I'm not (yet) enough of an audiophile to be able to rhapsodize on highs and lows, but the sound quality was no better to my ear than other headphones I've owned.  My greater concern was the utter lack of noise isolation.  Sure, Tascam doesn't bill the item as being noise isolating so if you are actively opposed to such features (for some reason), that's all well and good.  But compare these headphones to Panasonic's identically priced RP-HTX7 Stereo Headphones and the difference is astounding.  I purchased both for studio monitoring purposes, thinking I would have occasion to test each as they were my first and second choices.  The RP-HTX7s are fantastic where the TH02-Bs are severely lacking.<br /><br />I have great respect for the Tascam brand name and continue to use other products of theirs, but these headphones fall way short of the mark.  Once my refund for this product comes through I intend to pick up a second pair of Panasonic RP-HTX7 Stereo Headphones asa replacement.  Do yourself a favor and skip the middle step, just go straight for the RP-HTX7s.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very long cord useful for studio work<br />Attractive looking product<br /><br />Cons:<br />Shoddy materials and manufacturing<br />Less noise isolation than an average pair of $10 earbuds<br />Drastically inferior to identically priced products<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to a friend.
