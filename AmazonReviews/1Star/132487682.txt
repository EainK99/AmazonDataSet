I ordered this on my Amazon account and received the package 2 days late with the wrong block rocker .It was advertised as the Explorer version but was not.This is called DECEPTIVE  TRADE  PRACTICE .I am waiting for a responce from all parties liable.I wil also demand to know what Amazon does to vet their supplier in order to protect their customers from being scammed.Have you ever noticed that you are never undercharged or sent a better product than you pay for.The \\"mistake is always to the benefit of the company that you entrust with your credit card.
