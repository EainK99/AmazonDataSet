I used this speaker system for my son's Tae Kwon Do tournaments. Compared to other systems, it wasn't powerful and was hard to transport because it only has handles on the side. I bought it in January and yesterday, I tried to use it at a tournament and it wasn't charged. I brought it home and tried to charge again with no luck. Obviously there is something wrong with the battery because it does work when it's plugged in. This speaker was used a total of 6 or 7 times in 9 months. I've heard that Samson makes better portable speakers so that's what I'm going to replace this with. Maybe I got a lemon but my advice is, spend a few more dollars and get something that will last and works better.
