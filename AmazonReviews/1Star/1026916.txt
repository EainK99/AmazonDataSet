I was expecting to find some fault with this turntable at such a low price but come on... I could not get it to track all the way through a record because the tonearm lead-in wires were catching on something underneath the tonearm. The tonearm was loose and needed the mounting screws secured. The small audio pre-amp is on the same board as the USB port which causes a nasty noise when the USB is plugged in which eliminates direct connecting to a computer. I was forced to use the phono input of my old receiver and noticed a hum whenever I touched the cartridge only to find the lead-in wires were reversed. I had to open it up to correct the tonearm tracking problem which is when I discovered the reversed wiring. Also the speed pitch control center is way off and will need to be re-calibrated with a gauge. Still it will not hold proper speed and always sounds like the record is off-center. If you are not afraid to open it up and FIX a brand new turntable this is at least a third the price of others with the same features, otherwise spend a little more money. After less than a year I have replaced it with an older turntable that plays much better.
