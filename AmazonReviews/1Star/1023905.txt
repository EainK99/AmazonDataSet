I bought these for my daughter who just got her first guitar.  They are not what was advertised at all.  They are not sparkly or glittery.  I've attached photos showing them under light.  As you can see, they are just printed on cheap plastic.  She was very disappointed in them as am I.  Buyer beware.  Horrible value for the price paid.
