It felt uneven and so I put a leveler on it and sure enough it isn't even flat. Not only that, I ordered this and over a week later it did not arrive so I emailed amazon and they said they would send me another because it got lost in transit. They could have told me that. So 1 star for World Tour for selling uneven benches and making them in china where people work 16 hour days just to barely survive and 1 star for Amazon for losing the package before it even reaches ups and doing business with World Tour. I wish I just when to a friendly music store and got a bench even if it meant paying twice as much as this
