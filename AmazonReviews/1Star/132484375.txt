It works but very poorly. I find myself needing to pick or strum very hard in order for a signal to go through to the amp. When playing, it cuts out on quite a few notes  because I don't always have the time or ability to pick hard enough. More than half the time, a bunch of noise is played through the amp even when the guitar volume is down.
