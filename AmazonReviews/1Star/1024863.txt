The first impression on this product was great. it was pretty loud and had a lot of dun. We used it a total of four times before it stopped working. It did the job but it did not last long enough. Overall i am very disappointed with this purchase. Yo may end up wit a good speaker or may end up with one that only last a few uses. I would not recommend this speaker to anyone. It was embarrassing that at the middle of the party the speker stopped working and the volume was only half way.
