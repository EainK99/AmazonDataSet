I could forgive the cheap, flimsy mounting bracket that arrived bent if this light did its job, but the fact is, it does not. It throws off a dim, yellow, unfocused beam. I have it under 2 feet away from my disco ball, and most of the beam still misses the ball entirely because it spreads so rapidly. The beam is so dim that it's barely noticeable at about 10 feet. I have 3 watt LED flashlights that have a more focused beam, and throw the light much further when bounced off of the disco ball from across a room than this light does up close.
