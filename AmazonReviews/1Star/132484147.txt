9/22/2013 Windows 7 Pro, Intel Core i5 3.4 gHz, 16 gig RAM<br /><br />It's been 9 months and 6 bugfixes since Cubase 7 was released and things are as bad, if not worse, than when it came out. And it doesn't look like Steinberg is in any hurry to fix things. I've had ASIO issues, mainly Cubase 7's requirement that you run at buffer sizes/latencies 4 to 5 times higher than prior instances of Cubase (which is really creepy because ASIO is Steinberg's own patented technology), MIDI instability issues (caused by Steinberg's techs' suggestions), VST instrument difficulties including lazy initialization of sample-based intruments, timing issues, program hangs, major crashes on a regular basis and more. The new GUI is partially non-functional, clumsy and ugly. It is just a BAD program.<br /><br />Steinberg reps and fanboys like to point the finger at everything else as the cause of these problems, but the truth is that I can run Cubase 5.5 flawlessly on the same machine at far lower latency and with no crashes or MIDI issues. It's not my computer, it's not my soundcard, it's not my MIDI interface - it's Cubase that's the problem.<br /><br />I have been running Cubase since the Atari version and this is my 5th major upgrade. It is the WORST version of Cubase I have used. Save yourself the money and the the time and the endless frustration - DO NOT BUY CUBASE 7.
