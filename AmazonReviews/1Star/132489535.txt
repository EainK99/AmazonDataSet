Brought to the band director, and he suggested returning it. Bad sign that he had to make adjustments just to get it to play. Repair company rep they use was not familiar with the company and did not think it would be repairable if it broke.<br /><br />Maybe just a bad unit, but that band director was definitely not impressed with quality and suggested a pawn shop flute over this one.
