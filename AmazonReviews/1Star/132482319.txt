The cables appear to be good quality upon first inspection. I hooked up 5 of the into my power amplifier and all was good. Later in the evening I was switching out power amps and two of the plugs in my power amp would not release. The power amp is brand new and now has two of the cables stuck in it. I have used other xlr cables with no problem, these must be a bad batch and I now have a problem I must resolve. I have just spent the guts of 2 hours trying to get these cables out,, will update with outcome.....<br /><br />Update.<br /><br />I ended up having to open up my Marantz power amp this morning ( really not happy about this!) the 2 stuck cables seemed to be stuck on the release prongs. I ended up using a tiny tweezers to apply upward pressure to the release catches and at the same time pulling on the xlr connector. I finally got them out. While I have the amp open and could release the cables from the inside , I grabbed a set of monoprice cables I had handy. these worked perfectly and released perfectly.<br /><br />These cables have had really good reviews and that is why I purchased them. Either something has changed or I got a set with 2 duds but these could have cost me dearly if I used them on something that has hard to get at sockets. That said, these will have to go back, I would not put them near any of my power amps again.
