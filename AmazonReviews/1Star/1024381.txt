This is not a good purchase at $65. Misleading advertising states all wood.  What you really receive is a wood frame and CHEAP PLASTIC string holders that do not stayed tuned, not even for 30 seconds. Complete junk even for a child just learning.  Do not waste your money.  I later ask for recommendations from a music store and bought a suitable violin for a hundred dollars more.
