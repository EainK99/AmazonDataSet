I was very excited to go to delivery store to pick up this supposed to be Like New Pyle-Pro amplifier. But when I got it home and took it out of its packaging I immediately realized something was wrong with this amp. For starters it was very dirty in the backside of amp where the speaker mounts. Two screws where hanging onto the magnet of speaker. At that point I realized the darn wood that the speaker mounts to was broken right down the middle as if it was knowingly sent that way. I decided to see if it would even work so I plugged it in. It worked fine so I realized all was not lost. Buyers BEWARE OF BUYING USED!! I decided to keep the amp in hopes of repairing it since it works so well and not allow the cosmetics of it to deter me from enjoying this unit.
