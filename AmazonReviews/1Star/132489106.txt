Please note that the USB Port on the device is weakly attached internally (solder connection), and has a tendency to break.  Mine broke after only light use and no events that should result in this damage.  The keyboard is not repairable.  Customer service at the manufacturer did not help in any way, as it was just outside of warranty.  I would recommend you purchase a different brand.  I have several other keyboards (m-audio and IK Multimedia) and these have a better design that has lasted a lot longer.
