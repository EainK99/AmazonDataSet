When posting this original review I had owned the guitar for only a few weeks. As you can see, I was very content with it;  and with good reason as it was a nice guitar at first. Please see my comments at bottom for update.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST<br />I've played guitar close to 40 years now. I have played all types of genres of music & played all types of guitars both acoustic & electric. I now teach guitar for the most part. I bought this guitar to use in my teaching studio & to use on small gigs with my students. I'm very impressed with it. I've owned it about a month now & the guitar is already starting to open up with the sound. This is a very impressive instrument for the $; you would need to spend twice as much with other brands to do as well. Everyone that sees/hears it is thoroughly impressed; it looks like I'm a Recording King patron now!One of my students was impressed with it & purchased a 6 string banjo from Recording King. It is of superb quality as well. Recording King instruments are very nice; an excellent bargain! No need to spend tons of $ on instruments.<br />********UPDATE*********<br />OK, follow up after owning the guitar for over a year. Not good folks, the top has cracked in 3-4 splits behind the bridge. The bridge has came unglued from the body. I thought I may have gotten a lemon, but I know of 5 of these (including mine) that have been purchased & 4 of them did the same thing. Horrible construction. Since then I've been looking at Recording King guitar bridges & have seen several instances of them coming unglued, even in their \\"higher end\\" models. Horrible quality control, I am totally disappointed in them. Sadly I can no longer recommend this guitar to anyone, as a matter of fact I would say Buyer Beware! Horrible issues here with construction. To be clear, the guitar sounds good, holds tune well & is attractive in appearance. However, the top & bridge are defintely weak spots.<br />Look at bridges & tops very closely on any/all Recording King guitars!
