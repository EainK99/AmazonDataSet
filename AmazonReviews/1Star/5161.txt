I hate giving a 1 star review but the SN-5 didn't work at all. Removed the battery to remove the strip of protective plastic keeping the battery from going dead during shelf time, reinstalled battery turned it on and clipped it onto headstock to begin tuning. Nothing! Needle never moved once. Tested battery only low a half a volt out of a 3.3 volt. Amazon quickly refunded as I didn't want to replace. I'm sure it was just a 1 in a however many fluke, but that's just not a good first impression.
