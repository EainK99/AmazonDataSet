I bought this mic stand to go in my home recording studio. When I got it, everything looked good and went together easily. When I put it together and placed my mic on it, I could tell it was a mistake... It seems like this mic stand won't hold anything over 1 pound in weight. My mic isn't that heavy, but the stand just kept sagging at the joint and tipping over. I decided to deal with it by weighing down the tripod. It worked fine for a couple of months, but I was constantly adjusting it because it would start to sag over time. One day I walked into my studio to lay down a track and I saw my very expensive microphone laying on the floor because the stand had literally broken in half! Needless to say I was EXTREMELY upset at this. Luckily my mic was ok, but it could have been a disaster. Don't even waste your time on this product! I only owned it for 3 months and sparingly used it, and it broke. It didn't break because of misuse or an accident... It broke doing what it's supposedly supposed to be able to do: holding a microphone up. That means it's a very cheaply made product! If you plan on keeping your stand for a while, and you value your microphone, pay the extra money and get something that's going to last!
