I used it on my W211 head unit by Harman/Becker and very disapointed.<br />This adapter worked fine on the hands-free feature.<br />But when I tried to play music from my iphone 5 and blackberry Q5, this adapter is a crap (IMHO).<br />There were no sound of Bass (low end frequency) and my subwoofer became useless.<br />I have to use aux cassette adapter again for now.<br />Hope ION can do something about it.
