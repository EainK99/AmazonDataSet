We build trade show exhibits and these kits were to be used in an exhibit.  We've purchased this kind of stuff before and we're happy to find it here on Amazon at such a great price.  However, in this case, we got what we paid for.  These were unusable and had to be returned.<br /><br />The transformers:  They got so hot you couldn't even handle them.  We tried drilling holes and installing a small exhaust fan in the panel for safety, but even when we added more air circulation these were too much of a hazard for us to pass along to our customer.  As a test, we left them plugged in and left them on a table, no enclosure (even though the panel enclosure left them with about 1' on all sides except where they were mounted).  They were still too hot to handle.<br /><br />The light tape:  These also got too hot for LED tape.  So hot in fact that they melted their own glue and would not stay stuck where they were mounted.  In addition, we had to cut the tape lengths to suit our needs (this is something we have done over and over again with success using a more expensive product).  Once we cut the tape to length, it no longer worked for approximately 1' foot from the cut.  After that first foot, the next few inches would only work in colors (we needed white).<br /><br />The only good part is that we purchased them from Amazon, so the return was easy enough.
