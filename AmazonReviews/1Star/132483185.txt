This cover is the cheapest!  The first time I pulled the elastic cinch cord, it broke.  I returned it and ordered a custom fit cover (much more $ but so very worth it.)  The material is thin and you can see through it, It is oversized form my Casio Privia keyboard and looked absolutely horrid.  The attached pouch has a drawstring with a plastic &#34;bead&#34; to lock it that gets in the way when you put the cover on the keyboard.  Not recommended.... Do yourself a favor and buy a long bath towel to cover your keyboard rather than this piece of junk.
