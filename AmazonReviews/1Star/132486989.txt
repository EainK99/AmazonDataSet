[[VIDEOID:moLK7GPWQI31PU]]I bought CASIO PX-350 from Amazon in July 24. But only used for more than one month, the piano began to make strange noise.  If I  turn the piano on and leave it there without any touching, it makes some strange electrical noise (not piano sound). The noise is that kind of ziz zii noise as if you are listening to a radio and the signal is bad. I never image this kind of problem can happen and had my trust on Casio. So I already threw the box and package stuff away. But now I had a defect digital piano and the electrical noise is so irritating, it become such a headache no matter repair or return.<br /><br />At first I contacted Amazon. But this piano could not be returned because the deadline for return is August 31, 2013. I was asked to contact CASIO. I began to contact CASIO. CASIO person tole me to try 1) relocate this piano to another location. 2) try use headphone to see if there is still noise.  I moved the piano to another location. The noise is still there. I bought a headphone from Walmart since I do not have one at home. But the plugin does not fit. I could not find the required headphone plugin size from the PX-350 manual until I found from another user's comments in Amazon. It is require 1/4\\" one. After I informed CASIO all the information, I was told to contact authorized repair center. I am in Oahu, Hawaii. The only repair place for CASIO is in another island - Maui. How can this defected piano problem be solved?<br /><br />I just called the authorized repair place. I was told I need to pay for the repair by myself even though it is under warranty because this piano was not bought from them. I can not believe my ear.<br /><br />I recorded the sound this piano made. The noise you heard is not because of your speaker. They are the noise made by this CASIO PX-350
