At $150, I was certain that I was buying an amazing fog machine.  Especially considering the fact that most Halloween stores sell fog machines for under $80.  Unfortunately, the only thing amazing was how much this thing sucks.<br /><br />For starters, the instructions say the warm-up time 5 minutes.  It was a good 10-15 minutes before this thing would produce any fog.  But I don't mind a longer warm-up period.  What I do mind is the fact that, even when fully warmed up, it barely produces any fog.  I cranked up the Interval and Duration settings on the remote, and let it run for a good 30 minutes.  What I found was that, even at the maximum settings, it would only run once every 5 minutes and then produce a brief 6 second burst of fog.  And on top of that, the \\"low lying\\" fog stays low for less than a minute and then disperses.<br /><br />This thing is a joke.  I should have listened to all of the negative reviews before I bought it.  I plan on returning this hunk of garbage, and then buying one that is probably much better for half the price.  Sadly, I'm stuck with my overpriced $25 bottle of fog juice because I opened it to test this thing out.<br /><br />My advice: Don't waste your money!
