Designed by IDIOTS!  Horrible design!  Did anyone even try to test it before it went to manufacture?  I curse every time I have to use this case.  It's wheels are on the bottom edge of the case pointing straight out so unless your 7 feet tall it's going to drag, not roll.  The handles are inconveniently placed in the middle making it extremely awkward for average height people to move an 88 keyboard.  Everything about this case sucks and I would send it back if I could.  If the wheels were attached to the bottom, pointed down instead of pointing straight out from the edge it would have made a huge difference.
