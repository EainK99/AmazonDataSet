BUYER BEWARE:<br /><br />It is hard to describe my level of disappointment in this product and Tascam as a company.<br /><br />This ships without 1/2 of the cables required to power my Tascam DR-60 Mk II.  I am thinking very seriously about returning both the power supply and the Tascam and coming up with another solution for audio.<br /><br />How I went from a Fan to a Disappointed Customer in about a week:<br />===================================================<br />I purchased the Tascam DR-60 mkii so I'd be working with solid audio equipment.  I really liked the form factor and a lot of the features.<br /><br />My first round of disappointment with the Tascam came when I realized I had to purchase the power supply separately. I thought this was a very poor decision on their part.  Still, rather than backing down from my decision to purchase, I like the recorder and if this is what it takes, what the heck I'll buy the power supply too.<br /><br />So, today I finally had a few minutes to set up the Tascam and honestly I'd all but forgotten about my disappointment that they didn't include the power supply with the DR 60 Mk II.<br /><br />I pull out the Tascam recorder and I'm impressed with the looks.  So far, so good!<br /><br />I want to see how this thing performs.  I have high hopes at this point.<br /><br />I locate the box with the power supply and I almost laugh at myself - feeling foolish for fretting about the having to purchase the power supply separately.  By that time, I just want to hear the wonder of a great audio recorder.<br /><br />I open the power supply box.<br /><br />I pull out a cord.  It seems to be packaged well.<br /><br />I realize that this looks like a USB charger and I think to myself, the Tascam is designed to be used on a tripod.  I'm sure they provided a long cord so this rather heavy power converter doesn't dangle from my tripod weighing down the USB cable and putting a strain on my shiny new Tascam DR 60 MkII.<br /><br />I look for the USB cable.<br /><br />There isn't one.<br /><br />Hmmmmm... this has to be a mistake.  I look at the instructions.<br /><br />Lots and Lots of itsy bitsy printing in a multitude of languages... Ahhh forget it.  This is too hard and there's no way they would ship a product like this on purpose.  There has to be an explanation.  I'll look online.<br /><br />Low and Behold.<br /><br />They seriously ship a power supply with only 1/2 the cables required to use it as a standard practice.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure I don't have a long enough USB to USB mini laying around that I can use to run this thing. If I wanted to use batteries in my studio, I wouldn't have purchased the charger.<br /><br />Then I think, what!  Even if I had a the proper cord right in front of me, and if it was long enough to work well without putting a strain on my now disappointing Tascam DR-60 MkII, I don't want to be their customer anymore.<br /><br />I am honestly baffled at why any reputable company would think there was a benefit in operating in this fashion.<br /><br />They may have saved 50 or 60 cents by not shipping that cable, but they've lost my respect and my business.<br /><br />Disappointed
