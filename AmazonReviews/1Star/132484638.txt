I make Egyptian Sistrums to sale at events. I have been buying toys tambourines to take apart to make them with. They sounded wonderful. I thought to save myself time and money by getting your cymbals. They sound horrible, very tinny. I am going to have to disassemble one I have made to sale and go to Wal-Mart to find another toy tambourine to destroy to remake it before delivering the sistrum to it's owner.
