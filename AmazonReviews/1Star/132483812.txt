This microphone sleeve is not shown well in the photo. It is basically a glittery sock.<br /><br />It is a fabric pouch to slide your microphone into it.<br /><br />Very tacky, does not fit very well. Would not recommend.<br /><br />The singer friend that had me buy this for her thought it was terribly misleading.<br /><br />If you want a glittery sock to slide onto your microphone that is oversized and hangs over at the bottom this is your item.
