Selmer Tuning Slide and Cork Grease is a fine product.  It deserves a 5 star rating.<br /><br />This review, however, focuses on Amazon's false claim that you will receive a \\"box of 12\\" bottles of grease with this purchase.  On the contrary, I received ONE bottle sealed in a plastic bag.  Yes, it was shipped in a box, but there was only ONE bottle, not 12.  I then contacted customer service to ask where my other 11 bottles were.  They said they were sorry and would fill the rest of my order.  Today, I received a small, lightweight box.  When I opened it up, it contained ONE bottle of grease sealed in a plastic bag.<br /><br />So BUYER BEWARE:  If you order this product, you will only receive ONE bottle of Selmer Tuning Slide and Cork Grease, not a box of 12!!!<br /><br />Amazon, please remove the phrase \\"box of 12\\" from this product's description!!!
