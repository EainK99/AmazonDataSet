Well, I WAS planning on using a spare Superlux Mic i had with this project. I ordered this and a new Behringer micro-Power for Phantom supply of the 48v needed for the mic. I just needed to do some basic voice overs and narration on a few projects.<br /><br />Setup was dumb simple in Windows 7 and a generic plug and Play USB driver was installed by the system. It took some time for the unit to show in the recording settings however. When it did I tried to record. Nothing. Checked its wiring.. Nothing wrong again. In the system settings it was defaulted to ZERO level. Ok. Fixed that and I got some sound.<br /><br />I recorded myself talking for about 20 seconds. It seemed to work fine. I tried again... No work-y.<br /><br />The red LED began to flash and now will not stop. The unit now produces no sound whatsoever. As I will not waste my time returning it I opened the USB shell. Nothing more then one chip and a 12000 oscillator crystal.<br /><br />Absolute piece of complete and utter garbage.<br /><br />To solve the problem, which I should have done to begin with, was splice a mini stereo jack and wired it to a female XLR. I then plugged that into the phantom power, and from there the mic. Recording nicely through the standard analog mic jack on my laptop now.<br /><br />I would suggest something else if you want a USB mic solution. Get something with built in phantom and gain control.
