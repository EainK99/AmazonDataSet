At the onset I was optimistic about this stand- those reviewers who spoke of wobbling must have just put it together wrong... when it arrived I noticed that the finish was attractive and the adjustment mechanism felt solid. However upon putting it together myself I realized what all the other negative reviewers had experienced.<br /><br />The manufacture of this stand is flawed in that, when put together, the rails that hold the keyboard are not perfectly parallel. The rails that sit on the floor are equally skewed. What you end up with is something that not only rocks on the floor, but upon which your keyboard also wobbles. Very unsturdy. Returned immediately.<br /><br />Go for something with a welded construction for better results...
