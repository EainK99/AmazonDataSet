This drum machine had no 3/4 time in any of its programs. Though the Zoom RT223 had been purchased from Amazon the instructions in the shipping box indicated that customers should contact Zoom regarding defective products.  After contacting Zoom they indicated that it was defective and that I should return it to the Zoom Company in New York which I did (after spending another $24. for shipping!).<br />Three weeks after the product had been returned to Zoom i called to find out when it would be mailed back to me.  I was informed that it would be at least several more weeks before their repairman  could get to it due to the flood damage from Hurricane Katrina.  I asked the phone receptionist  how long a &#34;several weeks&#34; would be.  She would not provide a time.  I then contacted Amazon--the company.  Amazon indicated that they would replace the product but that the defective machine would need to be returned.  I explained that Zoom had the original machine.  Amazon explained that they could ship a new product but if they did not return the defective product within 30 days then I would be charged for another drum machine.  I explained to the Amazon representative that, I was dependent upon Zoom returning the machine to me within that 30 day limit and that was out of my control.  Subsequently, I recontacted Zoom and requested that the machine be returned to me so that I could send it to Amazon.<br /><br />Based on the above experience, I would not recommend this product.  Before discovering that it had no 3/4 time in any of its over 300 programs I thoroughly reviewed the operating manual.  That was very confusing.  This product is NOT user friendly and their customer service is very poor.
