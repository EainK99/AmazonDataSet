Extremely unhappy with this product. I saw the good reviews and thought it would be OK for my son to buy, he is 10 and used his own money. With that being said, I purchased him guitar lessons. The guitar will not stay in tune....at all. Also, the strings are pretty high making it more difficult to play. Now, it looks like I will have to purchase him a new guitar. I did ask for a refund as it has been less than 30 days but have not heard anything yet. Have already paid shipping of $11.95 once and hope not to again. We will see....... I will keep you posted.
