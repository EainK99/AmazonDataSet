I was excited for my 9 year-old daughter to try these out and so was she! She tore open the package, got her iPod, put them on and said, \\"They don't want to stay on.\\" She tried over and over, adjusting the band but they don't have enough tension to stay put on her head. I tried them on my big head and the same thing happened.<br /><br />Next, they only played out of one headphone. I tried different songs, I tested my iPod to make sure they worked with another set of headphones, all was good except for the First Act JamTech headphones.<br /><br />Lastly, while I thought it was a cool idea to have the flashing lights, once she put them on her head, she couldn't see them. Duh. Why did I think that would be fun for her? Unless she is looking in a mirror or in a group of kids, in which case she shouldn't be listening to music on her own but as a group, there is absolutely no benefit to the flashing lights.<br /><br />There were no redeeming qualities to this product. And I have enjoyed First Act products in the past. This one is a dud. Even if it does have volume limits and an auto off feature.<br /><br />Save your money and get a portable speaker or something.
