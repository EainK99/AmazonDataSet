I am not satisfied with the Honer Special 20 &#34;Progressive&#34; Bb Harmonica. The lower notes seem defective to me, especially Hole #3. Forget about bending notes. I'm lucky if I get Hole #3 it to make a sound. Maybe this one too is defective. It was a waste of money.<br /><br />I sent the first one back for the same reason, the lower notes seem to be defective, plus the case with the first one I bought was falling apart. I thought maybe it was a used Harmonic & Case. So I sent it back. Then when I received the second Harmonica to replace the first one, it too seemed defective when playing the lower notes. It's horrible. The case was fine this time.<br /><br />I own a Honer Special 20 &#34;Marine Band&#34; in C, and I love it. I really regret purchasing this &#34;Progressive&#34; Bb model.  I wish I would have purchase the Honer Special 20 &#34;Marine Band&#34; Bb or better yet, I should have taken my friends advice and gone with the Lee Oscar Bb instead. His plays pwerful low notes and you can bend the notes..
