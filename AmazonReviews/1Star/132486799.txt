I was very disappointed, this hi hat came with a bad clutch new right out of the box. I bought this to use in our recording studio, fortunately Amazon took care of my return fast so we did not miss any sessions.<br /><br />If I had this to do over I would have bought the REAL DW hi hat stand in the first place, it costs more, there's a reason.<br /><br />Good music to all!
