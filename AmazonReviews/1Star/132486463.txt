I deliberately ordered this one, with the dark, heavier looking prongs because I didn't want a junk staff liner. It came today...it's JUNK! It has the copper looking, very thin prongs. The handle is also very thin, not quite 1/4&#34; and a cheap, plain piece of wood. As soon as I loaded the chalk in the prongs, some held tight & a couple did not, I notice the prongs twisting. I can't imagine they will last very long with such thin wire. Since I couldn't give it a negative number of stars, I'll just say -5! So, I guess I paid to buy an example that the hubs can use to make one. Very disappointed, indeed!
