I was very disappointed with the cheap quality, poor performance and over all guitar. It has zero weight to it, I mean so light your afraid to pick it up to hard and break it. The neck is a poorly painted plastic, the neck was so tweaked every string buzzed and it was impossible to keep in tune. I got so disappointed about the guitar over all I never plugged it in. I returned it. In mind it's un playable. I thought I knew alvarez but if this is what they put out now. Save the money and get a Yamaha for less with better quality. I know it's not a fender or Gibson or high end but I thought for the money it would be well constructed and playable. I was wrong and won't buy an alvarez again.<br />Don't buy it
