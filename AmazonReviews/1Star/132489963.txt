First Review: First of all, the sound is spectacular. While the physical comfort level is OK, the earbuds themselves are extremely inconvenient to put on and take off.  The cables are extremely stiff and must be wrapped up over your ears.  Also, ignore the color designation, the only thing that is white is the barrel of the earbud.  Essentially everything is black and will not match your silver iPod.<br />Second Review: In a couple of years these phones stopped working. I suspected they were clogged by earwax, but the wire tool supplied failed to remove it. Shure wanted $152 to replace them (evidently they do not repair earphones). So before I threw them away, I busted the cases open and sure enough all it was was a tiny chuck of earwax blocking the oriface. They operated loud and clear, but now without the cases to hold the earpieces they were worthless. Thanks Shure for a very expensive product that became worthless in a short time.  Also, I have decided that the over the ear wire arrangement is unacceptable. Don't buy them.
