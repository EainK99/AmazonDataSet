went to local GC, bought it on a Friday, used it on Saturday and apparently I tightened it too much (I didn't its just cheap material) because the housing for the tripod nob broke so now the nob just turns without tightening. Cheap material for the nobs...  I went to exchange and they haven't been able to find a replacement so I'm getting my money back. Definitely not worth the $100.
