This stand was poorly constructed and the leg broke within the first 3 months of use. It was purchased for my then 11 year old daughter and was off balance when extended to standing height for her. I would not purchase again - in fact I am leaving this review after going back through my purchase history while looking for a new stand...I wanted to be sure I did not purchase the same brand again.<br /><br />This stand would only be useful as a semi-disposable unit that will hold a few sheets of paper at a seated height.
