DO NOT BUY THIS REED!<br /><br />As a student bassoonist, you will be very frustrated and disappointed buying these reeds. You will sound awful, and what fun is that?<br /><br />Purchasing bassoon reeds from a professional or your teacher are your best bet. The reeds may be more expensive at first, but the reed will have a good sound, and therefore the bassoonist will have more fun playing!<br /><br />The picture they use to advertise their reeds disgusts me. You might as well be using a 2x4 as a reed than the reed pictured - you will get the same sound - horrendous.
