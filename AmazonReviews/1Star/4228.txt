Mine didn't come with the nut & bolt that's on the vertical tube holder.  Luckily I have lots of Gibraltar hardware and I think I can salvage parts from other components, but WTF?  I think this was used, cleaned up and re-shrink wrapped and passed off as new.  I've bought over $400 in Gibraltar HW this past year and have never had this experience.  If I wasn't in a hurry to build the new rack I would return these parts.
