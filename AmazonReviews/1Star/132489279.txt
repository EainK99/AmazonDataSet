I have used my Macbook air internal microphone for all the recording needs for several years until I return to school again. As I need to record a lot of lectures during school, I decided that this Go Mic would be a good investment for my education. I've read some reviews saying that \\"oh this mic is totally great\\" and blah blah blah... and bought it from Amazon. Those reviews turn out to be untrue. Although there is some slight difference in the sound from the Go Mic, it is no better than that of the Macbook Air. It is neither clearer or louder than the records I have from the internal mic. Therefore, my advice to you is don't waste 40 bucks on this mic if you have a Macbook Air. I don't know if other laptops would give you the same experience but my guess is that it should be likely.
