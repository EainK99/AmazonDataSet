Unit appears cheaply made with large gaps at corners of case. After installing unit, and plugging it in, nothing would work. All that was lit was one back lit toggle switch. In fact, the more toggle switches I turned on, the dimmer they got. I got to 5 backlit switches before they all turned off. Checked outlet...ok. Checked integrated circuit breaker...ok. Tried to return it, but it was passed the window of time. Sooo, I now have a sophisticated night light.......as long as I only turn a few switches on.
