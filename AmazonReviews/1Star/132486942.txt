Bought this item directly from Acronova to rip and copy my music collection of 3000 compact discs, 1000 blu ray films and 2000 dvd movies to my server. Well the information on the nimbie homepage is completely misleading as it is not possible to get any software that can rip blu rays automatically !!!!! So it is not able to rip and compress the blu rays - you have to do it one by one. As to copy and compress the dvds the device jams every 3rd or 4th disc and often fails to connect. Also the enclosed software is useless. The included \\"RipIt\\" program freezes every now and then and stops the whole process and then you have to start all over. I have used several days to find another ripping software that is able to handle the automation proces - but without any luck. As for now i have not tried to copy my music cd's  - but based on my experiences with this the device so far it will be a totally waste of time. There is no support I have written lots of mails to the softwaremanufactures and the Acronaova company without getting any response at all. Conclusion: the device do not work properly,  the software included is not working, and the description of the product is misleading. Totally waste of money and time. DO NOT BUY.
