I usually don't write comments on Amazon unless I am really disappointed... This is the WORST purchase I EVER made.<br />I am a drummer (and not a violent one) The chair broke after two days. The materials used are very low quality and the finitions are poorly stiched and assembled.<br />My advice: DO NOT buy this chair if you don't want to waste your money!
