I really hate to leave a bad review but it is what it is.  I spent 350$ for the 12 step plus midi expander etc.  I have had it for four months and it has already failed.  I sent it back to the company for &#34;evaluation&#34; for warranty repair and surprise surprise they said it was due to customer damage..  They say that I damaged the USB port..  WTF??  Dave Criss stated that they build them &#34;Ford tough&#34; and they even have pictures of a truck running over one but the USB port cannot take normal stage use.  Part of this stems from having a separate midi interface.  What this means is that when you are setting up on stage, you have the pedal, a USB cable stretched out to the little midi box, a separate power supply connected to the midi box and then you can hook up your midi cables to your midi loop..  Mr. Criss admitted that the USB port was a source of failure.  He said that it was sometimes caused by people unplugging the USB cable from the box and wrapping it around the pedal..  Let me get this straight, you can run over it with a truck but you can't wrap the cable around it and put it in your gig bag??  So they denied my warranty request.  They suggest that I repair it myself.. They also have NO spare parts for these nor do they do ANY in house repairs..  I love the chromatic layout and having a full octave, but for the stage I am going to have to stick with the Behringer FBC1010.  It is built like a tank and does not require any special interface..  If you have any questions please email me at robertestonejr@gmail.com and I will be glad to let you read the entire email exchange that I had with these guys.  I am entirely disappointed with this very expensive and basically useless piece of gear..
