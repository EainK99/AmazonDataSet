I purchased this 1 month before a birthday for a gift for my son after he saw it in a guitar shop and wanted one.  When he  opened the box, the head was broken off the stem.  How embarrassing!  I tried to return it and was 3 days out of date for the return period.  I'm very disappointed in the quality to be shipped a broken tuner.
