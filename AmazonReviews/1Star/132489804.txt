Look, I get that this is very cheap. I could overlook the scratches and dings and cheap construction. But it was advertised as a real, playable kid's guitar. It is not. The tuning pegs slip and will not hold the string tension; it is therefore impossible to keep in tune. This is not a real instrument that a kid can learn to play on.  If you just want something that looks like a guitar, OK.
