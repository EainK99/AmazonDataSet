I had never played Violin before, though I've played Guitar for over 20 years.  I ordered the used &#34;very good&#34; version of this violin for 350.00. I thought worst case, I could always sell it and upgrade later if need be. I was pretty excited waiting for it to show up.<br />Then it came....the case was scuffed up, the violin itself had 3 dings in the wood that were much more than normal wear.  The strings were cheap looking and the high (E String) wouldn't stay in tune, In fact I could barely tune it. I had to switch out the pegs that just wouldn't hold.<br />Then I played it. I know i'm new but I thought I would get a better sound, a louder sound, something.  I bought 50.00 strings. I took the Peg out holding the Low G string.  I couldn't get it back in.  I couldn't play it after this.  I went to a store that sells Violins and for 350.00 I found a few that were really quite nice.  Then for 600.00 I got the CREMONA 800.  the violin instructor at the store pointed me towards it and even compared it to a 1500.00 violin he had from Czech.  The Cremona was right there.  pretty nice looking too.  Amazon is being very cool though and sent me the return label for return.
