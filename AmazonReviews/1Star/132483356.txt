SAVE YOUR MONEY! SCAM!<br /><br />I ordered the CB Parade snare drum [14x10\\"] and did not get everything that was stated in the product description or features.<br /><br />It claimed:  \\"Product Description:  These lightweight marching snare drums feature laminated wood shells covered in durable white plastic. A smooth action throw-off with extended snare cable and bridge rollers provides excellent snare response. A webbed sling and a multi angle carrying bar come standard with this snare drum.\\"<br /><br />Though it came WITHOUT the sling or multi angle carrying bar. I ended up with a marching snare and NO way to march with it! **LAME**<br /><br />I am currently talking with CB Percussion on getting the \\"standard\\" accessories.  They say it should have been included, and thats what I thought too.  I do not understand the false advertising Amazon is doing as there were no accessories to the marching snare.  If CB Percussion cannot get me the necessary accessories that go with the snare I will be returning it and lowering my review to 1 star.<br /><br />*Update<br />CB Percussion has still not sent the accessories.  I had emailed with them back and forth, though the promised accessories have not come and it is now almost two months since this crap started.
