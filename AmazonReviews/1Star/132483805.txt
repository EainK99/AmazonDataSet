Unfortunately, my experience with this device was so bad I had to return it. I plugged it in, tried to use it with Garageband and heard a hum so loud that it overpowered the signal...I could hear the guitar down below the hum somewhere, so I thought maybe the 9V battery was introducing a lot of noise. I changed the battery, but got no change in hum, so I had to return it as unusable.<br /><br />I assume I got a bad one, but I'm not inclined to try again.
