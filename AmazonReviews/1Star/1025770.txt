Hi, We purchased this machine maybe 2 years ago and enjoyed it.  It's a kid karaoke so don't expect great performance.  Unfortunately recently we took it out to be used again and it has this extremely sticky film to it that is impossible to remove. I tried soap, goo gone and nothing seems to help.  I don't know what else to try but I would not recommend this product if this happens.
