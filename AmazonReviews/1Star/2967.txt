OMG! this is the worst product i have ever had!!! i have tried many ways to work out on my mac (logic). unfortunately, i can't use it properly!! the problem is  the sound is delay,and they got buzz sound!!!!!!!! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR THIS STUPID USB MIDI CABLE, YOU WILL REGRET.
