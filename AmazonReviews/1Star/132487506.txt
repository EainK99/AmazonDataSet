Not recommended!<br />I bought this guitar for my daughter to begin Guitar Lessons.  After a couple of months, we noticed that the neck was litterally splitting away from the body of the guitar.  Now just 3 months later, I am shopping for a new guitar!<br /><br />As an insult, Amazon allows the owner to REMOVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK from history.  I left negative feedback and when I checked today, it says it was removed by the owner.  This is amazing.<br /><br />I am trying to contact &#34;Donn K&#34; to either get a refund or a new guitar.  The guitar MAY have been defective so I am giving the elusive owner the benefit of the doubt.  I hope they fix the problem  I will update this thread if they fix this.
