Having played a soprano and alto, and having had multiple midi keyboards. I felt particularly calm in buying kind of an off midi instrument. I've done a fair amount with finale and linux's lmms. But boy... I was severely disappointed in this. its not very responsive. There's practically no support for this at all. Good luck getting ahold of Akai, and getting any information. I felt like the only use for this, period, would be to for fast note input (rather than writing, or using hotkeys). Spend the extra money and get the Akai Pro (not usb). Its absolutely worth it.
