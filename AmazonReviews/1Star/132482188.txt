Finally set up the music stand only to realize it is too short and does not adjust for taller children.  Any child over 5ft will find this stand too short. The picture is deceiving.  The stand is also not sturdy since it tilts.  Very poorly made and  cheap quality.  I would return it but the company is  going to deduct the free shipping cost from the refund and I still have to pay for return shipping.  Realized it was not worth the hassle to return.  This is how this company makes their money. Lousy product.
