DO NOT be deceived by the cute faerie!!!  I am extremely disappointed and alarmed with the item I received.  Luna is seriously lacking in quality control.  Out of the box, it does not belong in the hands of a child.  It has protruding frets that are very sharp, resulting in me receiving many surface cuts on my fingers when attempting to play.  Every single simple chord I played resulted in the exact same awful buzz sound from the strings.  So now I have to pay a luthier to fix this mess before I can safely hand it to my granddaughter or anyone else.  Please, for just a dollar more, purchase a Makala dolphin!!!  Or for a little less, a Mahalo.  They are both great starter ukuleles for any age.<br /><br />After posting this review, I sent a copy to Luna and got an immediate response from them.  It seems that they had a partner who's original product did not live up to Luna's standards.  Sadly, Luna ended up with several pallets of unsellable ukuleles.  However, I was offered the original faerie prototype or another model from their mahogany line.  My granddaughter chose the concert Mo'o and is very happy with it.  Many thanks to Luna for making it right!
