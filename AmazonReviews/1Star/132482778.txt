I looked at this case for my  ASUS Memo Pad 172V 7 inch Tablet. However, the tablet used in the photo does not resemble my tablet. My tablet doesn't have a standard size usb only a micro usb. It appears the keyboard plugs into a standard usb port. So either they used the wrong photo or it really won't work on my tablet.
