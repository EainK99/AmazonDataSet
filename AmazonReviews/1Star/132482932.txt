Didn't like this product the Pink Elegant Diamond Back Cover was very pretty but it does not fit the HTC One Phone accurately, it is slightly too big but it is a very pretty cover.<br />The 360 Car Rotatble Windsheild Mount Kit was to big and didn't mount to the windsheild properly it is in the way on my new HOnda Civic.<br />The best item in this kit was the 3.5mm stereo audio cable that was the only item in the kit that did what it was suppose to do and worked properly.<br />I would only recommend the 3.5mm stereo audio cable it did what it needed to do and more.
