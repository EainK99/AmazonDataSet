I am a classical percussionist, and I was recording a prescreen audition and needed an analog to digital converter, because my old laptop was picking up way too much computer noise. When I first got the Icicle, I noticed that there is zero metal on the body of the device - it's all chrome-painted plastic. And the particular device I received was rattling as if something inside was broken. So first off, the build quality makes it feel like a cheap toy. The recording quality was okay, albeit a bit noisy, for higher-pitched instruments. HOWEVER, when recording warm, lower-pitched instruments, like timpani and marimba, the Icicle provided its own soundtrack of buzzy feedback that could not be fixed, no matter what settings I tried. I bought a $400 mic for this recording project, and this Icicle made it sound like a $50 mic. If you need a quick, cheap device for simple, lo-fi recordings, this would be it - but you're wasting your money if you think you can get a good quality recording from this toy.
