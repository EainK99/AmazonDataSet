quick drum stick lesson:<br /><br />most sticks are made out of hickory. hickory is strong, and does not warp as quickly as other woods. that is why it is ideal for drumsticks. some other sticks are made out of sugar maple. these are much lighter because the wood is less dense. maple sticks are best for playing lightly, people who dont like the feel of a heavy stick, or for electronic kits (simply because they dont need to be hit hard)<br /><br />these are very light weight sticks. the tips are put on poorly, and i had to roll half of the box across the table just to find one straight pair!<br /><br />yes, you pay 2$ per pair. a great deal compared to any quality pair of real drumsticks. but at what cost?
