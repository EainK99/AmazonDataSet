I received this unit and it didn't even work. Nothing worked... No radio, aux, USB. I was really excited to use it and ordered it for an event. It is under warranty but it's such a hassle to contact Amazon and the manufacture to send it back and get a new one. I'm not even sure if I want a new one now because who knows how long it will function for next time.
