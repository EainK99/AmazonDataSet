I bought this program over a year ago. Basically set it up, tried it out at one show and never again. It was awful. It was always freezing and giving me error messages. When Karaoke Cloud came out I wanted to try it and since I had already paid for Karaoki I thought I would give it another try hoping they had all the bugs fixed. Had just bought two brand new computers and installed and set up and bought karaoke cloud pro subscription. Same thing- You cannot run a show using this program without looking like a fool. Constantly getting error messages \\"file already loaded\\". And then nothing would play. Tried TONS of songs and different ways of doing it and tons of bugs/problems. Bought Karaoke Cloud straight from Digitrax not knowing it was actually a contract WITH PCDJ. You can imagine my frustration now! Paid for a program that is crap and now pay $100 a month for a subscription I cannot use tied to the crappest program! Sure I could suck it up and try to use it, working around the bugs. Ive already spend hours upon hours reading their support forums and asking for help. No program should cause you this much frustration! Do NOT spend your hard earned money on this program!!!
