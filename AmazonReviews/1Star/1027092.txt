Ok I ordered this drum after watching many videos and reading as much as I could about the product.  Sounds NOTHING like the youtube video review. It came shipped with the corner badly damaged, I know that's not x8's problem so that aside, the stain/color looks nothing like this which I was willing to overlook. However it is beyond me how x8 is charging this much money for something so low quality.  the front is extremely thin and fragile/flimsy, could easily be broken.  the cajon as a whole is very light and not it a good way. Nowhere does is mention that the snare is wire which I didn't want either.  I received this instrument and was on the way to the UPS store for a return in about 5 mintues.
