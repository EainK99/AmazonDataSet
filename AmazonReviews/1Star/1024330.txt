This cable is junk. I ordered 2 cables. One was DOA and the other broke within minutes. I unscrewed the 1/4 inch jack to check the connection and  they were badly corroded. There were only 3 or 4 thin wires soldered to the sleeve connectors and they all snapped off from strain. Very poor design and quality.
