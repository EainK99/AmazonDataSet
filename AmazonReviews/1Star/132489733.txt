I've owned a few pioneer headphones over the years cause I like the sound, but they always break. The swivel above the earpieces are plastic and this always crack. ALWAYS. I bought a pair years ago and through warranty replacements I've actually ended up with 8 new ones over the years for the price of one pair. I thought they finally fixed the problem by upgrading me to the new metal swivel design but guess what? The plastic piece above the metal swivel broke.<br /><br />I'm now awaiting my free new replacement in the mail from pioneer..in the meantime ill break in the Allen and Heath headphones.<br /><br />I've been a dj for years and if wasn't for all the free headphones pioneer keeps sending me as a replacement i'd never own a pair anymore.  They should just stick to making turntables and mixers.
