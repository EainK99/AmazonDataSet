this product is billed as a full duplex communications solution; i.e., my interpretation is that it is a party line for 4 individuals to communicate at once.  i purchased it for that reason and it does not achieve this functionality, at all.  instead, it ships with a Master and 3 slave type radios.  you cannot all talk at once; the master can communicate with slaves that click their &#34;continous talk&#34; function (i forget what the mfg calls this function).  the joke is that the continuous talk mode is spotty (we were using these on the aft deck of a 100' ship), and the units themselves are chintzy and basically do not really achieve what you want.  perhaps it was because we had a wifi router nearby, but i changed our channels and continued to receive the same poor performance.  will return once we are off the ship
