This is the worst guitar stand!  Lifetime manufacturer warranty, the joke is on me.  I can't find the manufacturer to return this piece of JUNK.  I have had this stand less than 6 months.  First the Pivoting Silicone Stopper fell off the third time I used it, then the Silicone Rubber Pads fell off, and now every time I take it out something else falls off!  It is not stable at all.  I thought it would just take some time getting used to setting it up, but no, I have to put it behind me, up against a wall or in a corner, or the slightest touch will knock it and my guitar over.  Especially now that the parts that are supposed to protect it are falling off, making it completely off balance.  I cannot use it any more.  What a mistake to wait too long to return it, but I've been too busy.  I am not hard on my equipment; most everything I have has lasted for years.
