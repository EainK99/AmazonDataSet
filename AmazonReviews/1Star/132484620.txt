Pro: sound clear, right price, clear picture, many functions.<br /><br />Cons: makes a popping sound when it reads the next song or playing the next scene in the movie.<br />  The popping sound is so annoying. My low end DVD player never done that before. It should be a smooth<br />  Transition to the next chapter, scene, or song. I guess you pay for what you get.<br /><br />One star rating for this item. The Amazon Seller was able to give me a full refund and a pre-shipping label. Thank you
