I purchased this bag to protect a nice conga when transporting it to gigs. Rather than protect my conga the case ultimately damaged my drum when the shoulder strap hardware failed while I was carrying the conga from the strap.  My hands were full with other percussion instruments while I was walking and the 50+ pound conga suddenly crashed to the concrete sidewalk. Fortunately I wasn't on a stair case as the conga would have become a formidible \\"boulder\\" crashing down toward anyone below with potential serious repercussions.  I reattached the strap with the metal clip bi-passing the failed swivel-point hardware and started walking carry it again only to have the other side of the strap fail at the same metal swivel bracket.  This time the drum bashed onto a curb and bounced into a street.  The drum I wanted to protect is now dented and I've gotten no response from Amazon about how I get compensated for the drum damage.  What if someone was hurt by this product failure?  Would I have been responsible? Amazon? Humes? - All I can say is they seriously need to up the quality of the hardware before I'd ever consider buying another one of their bags.  Seriously disappointed and pissed my conga will never be the same.
