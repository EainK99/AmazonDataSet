This was a great little projector until the green laser stopped working after a few uses.  The seller first offered to replace it or refund my money then later decided that they have had this same issue too many times and would just refund my money.  They even sent me a pre-paid shipping label. If you buy it from the same place I did, it may be worth the gamble that you get a good one, but I have been left with the impression that they would probably stop selling them.
