STOP! If you plan on using this for cosplay ect. Carry on buy it. It has a very nice design, a very nice smooth ceramic texture and just beautiful. BUT if you plan on using it for an instrument STOP! Don't make the same mistake I did. I recommend buying the non Zelda ceramic design. Like the 12-hole plastic ocarina which is better than this one.
