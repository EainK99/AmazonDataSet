I would not waste my money on another item like this. the guitar was WAY too small, the amp blew out the second i turned it on, and it wasn't loud at all, the cable was very weak and broke within a week, and the strap broke in five minutes. other than that, the basic sound of the guitar is ok, and the instructional DVD was helpful.
