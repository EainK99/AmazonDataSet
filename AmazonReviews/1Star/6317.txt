I saw a UTube thing, saying that the reviews stating that it doesn't stay stuck to the guitar isn't true.  Well guess what,  you can try to lick it and stick it, but it will just pop off in the middle of you song after about 10 - 15 minutes,  Horrid!  Quite a pity, as it sounds great while it's attached!
