This is the second pair of consumer-grade powered M-Audio desktop monitors I've owned in less than 4 years.  The amp inside the first pair died after only 1 year, and the amp inside this pair also died after 3 years.  The amps don't simply die all at once -- they gradually fizzle out over time in noticeable ways (one or both speakers will develop volume/static/clipping/hum).  Out of curiosity, I took the left speaker (containing the amplifier) apart to see if it was something I could repair.  Inside I found four visibly leaked/blown electrolytic capacitors and several other charred components.  Some were so burnt that they had crumbled in pieces away from the circuit board.  M-Audio clearly uses poor-quality components.  Then they cram all those components into a tightly-enclosed space without sufficient ventilation or heat dissipation.  No wonder the amps burn themselves out!  And I never ran these very loud either -- they were always at 50% or less on the volume knob.<br /><br />I bought the following items to replace my busted M-Audio AV40s.  This setup blows M-Audio's stuff away in all regards: build quality, sound quality, efficiency/thermals, and volume.  Using a cheap (but still good quality) outboard amplifier means you won't have to throw out the speakers if the amp ever dies, and it also means there are no thermal issues with the amp being crammed inside a small speaker.  Why spend $140 on something that sucks when you can spend $200 on something infinitely better?<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000U2G6VA JBL Control 1 Pro High Performance 150-Watt Miniature Studio Monitor Speaker (Pair, Black)]]<br />These speakers are excellent.  They have a wide flat frequency response with good clarity and sound stage.  I ran my usual tone-generated sine wave sweep (10Hz - 30kHz) through these things (using the Lepai amp below) and there were no noticeable drop-outs or peaks at any particular frequencies.  These truly are the closest you'll get to studio-quality reference monitorsin a small desktop package below $200.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00C2P61FO 2013 New Version!! Upgraded LP-2020A+ Lepai Tripath Class-T Hi-Fi Audio Mini Amplifier with US Power Supply Black, US Shipping!!!]]<br />These little Lepai amps have a great reputation, and I'm happy to say this one lives up to the hype.  The 20W output easily pushes the 150W JBLs to extremely loud volumes while still running completely cool.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003TUMDWG 12v 6a Adapter Power Supply for LCD Monitor with Power Cord]]<br />Probably unnecessary, but cheap, so why not?  Technically the 12V 3A supply included with the Lepai should neatly drive the 2x20W output without coming up short, but it never hurts to have the headroom.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000TQ4D8K Yamaha YST-SW012 8-Inch Front-Firing Active Subwoofer]]<br />This is the subwoofer I've used all along, so I thought I'd mention it here so that this list represents a complete system.  It's been great to me: powerful, runs cool, good price.  My only complaint is that the only input connection it provides is a single mono RCA jack, so I had to throw together a simple passive mixer circuit to merge the left/right channels down into a mono feed for the sub.  I'm an engineer so that was easy for me, but if you're not interested in DIY electronics and just want something that works, you might want to look for a sub that has separate left/right RCA inputs.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005STCILC Audioengine DS2 Desktop Speaker Stands (Pair)]]<br />These are the desktop speaker stands I've used all along, so I thought I'd mention them here so that this list represents a complete system.  These angle the speakers up just enough to project at your head, while also acoustically isolating the speakers from the desktop.
