Don't bother wasting your $2.  I wished I had seen the one other review (don't know how I missed that but I did) but I would like to also say this flimsy piece of plastic with a little metal hook is too short for cleaning a flute and its misleading marketing to list it as a flute cleaning rod. Rip-off !!!
