Had this less than 9 months and it's toast. In the middle of a gig yesterday things suddenly got very quiet because, hey, there's nothing coming out of my amp. The little red light was on indicating it had power but there was no sound. Today plugged it in and fiddled with all the knobs and nothing. It's getting power  but it's not making any sound. Thanks Vox.
