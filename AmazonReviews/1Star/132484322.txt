Vic is a great guy and reimbursed our test order of 2 cables completely. He also said I need not need to send cables back so I destroyed them because they look exactly like ones that do. I also offered to test any other cables that he may think of selling and told him if he acquired good cables, I would place a blanket order for 100 cables with releases of 20 cables at a time for my business. He never accepted!  Since then and on 8/11/15 and after writing to him stating I needed functioning cables with opto-isolators. I next got a reply from Jennifer not answering my question and pointing me to the cable on their website, I then tried again to get a reply to my needs but again I got a message from Jennifer pointing me to the cable on the website. These products do not meet the MIDI standards and are junk. Some body of low knowledge in China looked designed around the need for the opto-isolator to save a fews cents and destroyed the funcionality of the cable. BTW the solder pads on the pcboard are still there, I am amazed that Amazon allows this junk to be sold when the cost of a signal diode and a cheap opto-isolator would turn this cable into a functioning one.
