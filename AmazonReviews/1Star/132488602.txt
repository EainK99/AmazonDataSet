Bottom line - Purchasing this ($60) originally was a worthwhile experience, but now I am buying a real violin ($300).<br />  I had only a short-lived experience with playing a violin in elementary school, but now that I'm 60, I have time to mess with it again.  I was not sure if my fingers and arms would still bend enough to use a violin, and a few minutes with one in a music shop told me nothing, so I decided to by a cheap V.S.O. (violin-shaped-object) and see how the experience went.<br />1.. The product description said that the pegs, fingerboard and chin rest would be hardwood, but only the pegs are wood, the rest of the items are plastic.<br />2.  There are lots of videos on YouTube which helped me get it set up enough to play (instead of taking it to a music store).<br />3.  I found that the additional purchase of a shoulder rest was necessary so that the violin set properly for playing.<br />4.  Something I could not fix myself was that the sound post was positioned too far from the fingerboard, so that when the bridge was properly positioned (again, see the YouTube videos), it was nowhere near the sound post.  I was just happy the sound post was present and standing up.  The instrument still plays, so I just left it alone.<br />5.  The plastic tailpiece has a small crack on its leading edge between the fine tuners, but it has no effect on the instrument.<br />6.  It took me quite a while to tune the instrument, but it got tuned.  Another required purchase is Ardslley Peg Drops, because there is simply no way the pegs will hold tune without it.  Even after using the drops, the pegs kept slipping for a while, but slowly they held and once the strings stopped stretching, they stayed pretty much in tune enough to play.  I was careful, and none of the strings broke while I tuned them for the first time.  I was also careful that the bridge did not lean over.<br />7.  The bow had a couple of broken hairs, but after them being cut off and the bow rosined, it is serviceable.<br />8.  For the first two days I used the bridge just as it came, but I found that it really had to be cut down because it was way too high for this instrument; the strings were far more than the suggested 3 to 5 mm above the end of the fingerboard.  Again, there are instructions on the internet.  After careful measurement I found I needed to take the bridge down a little over 2 mm.  I was able to carve, sand, and re-install the bridge without incident.  Once the instrument was tuned I measured and found the E string was the right height, but the G string was still slightly high (it is supposed to be a little over 1mm higher than the E, but measured more than that)... I just left it as good enough.  I made a few other measurements and found that under tension the neck of the violin seems to lift slightly, which may be why the G string was slightly high again.<br />----------------<br />I'm doing some lessons from the internet.  The violin seems to play OK now, but what do I know.  So, if my experience is any indication, it is possible for someone who knows nothing to set this instrument up enough to play.  It is also true that once it is set up, it is playable, but only marginally so.<br />----------------<br />At one week from arrival, I opened the case and found the tailpiece had snapped at its thin most cross-section.  This made the instrument useless.  I thought the manufacturer would at least design the plastic parts to withstand the tension of the strings, but I guess not.  I purchased and installed a replacement tailpiece (<$20).<br />----------------<br />After a few weeks I got tired of not being able to get the instrument to stay in tune, so I decided to work on the pegs.  Initially I used a fine round file to increase the diameter of one of the holes so the peg would fit further in, but I found this to be unnecessary. I could scrape the surface of the peg and reduce its diameter to accomplish the same thing.  In doing so I found the pegs were actually a light colored wood painted black. Since the pegs fit further in, it was then necessary to re-drill the holes in the pegs for the strings, but this was easily done with a 1/16 inch drill.  I again used the Ardslley Peg Drops, and the instrument seems to stay in tune better now.
