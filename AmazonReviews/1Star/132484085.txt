Initially I was impressed with the construction of this pedal. It seems rather well built for the price.... thats where the positivity ends. I plugged it into my power supply and it didn't work so I switched to a 9 volt. I took the cover off, attached the battery and spent the next five minutes trying to put the cover back on correctly. The battery cover is a prime example of piss poor engineering IMHO. I plugged it into my rig and when I played I could not believe what I heard.... utter CRAP! Tinny, shrill, thin and above all NOISE NOISE NOISE! I guess there are some things you cannot go cheap on... I've learned my lesson here!
