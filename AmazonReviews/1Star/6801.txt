I just got this and tried it out - it's now resting in my closet unused.  I thought I'd upgrade my on stage $4 foam ball-type windscreen but the A2WS is unusable comparatively.  As soon as I got it in place and tested it out I was sure I had screwed it up, so I spent about two hours trying to find the right adjustment for it... but no matter how much I tried I could not get it to block the popping sounds even half as well as the on stage one.  If your goal is to stop close mic popping, this is not your friend, get the on stage foam ball type one as it is much cheaper and performs much better in this area.  The A2WS works fine if you are mic'ing vocals at like 8&#34; and will stay on better, so for live performance this is probably a better option.  But, it is completely unusable for anything closer IMO.
