I bought this to use my Rock Band 3 keyboard as a MIDI keyboard with my late 2012 Mac Mini and GarageBand.  I plugged it in, and it didn't work.  I read many different how-to articles, and I couldn't get it to work.  I am disappointed.  I may have received a defective device.  Unfortunately, I forgot to return it within the return window, so I cannot report whether a new one would work.
