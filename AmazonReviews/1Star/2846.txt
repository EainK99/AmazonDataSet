I've never left a review for anything on amazon ever, but I felt I needed to for these. I bought these thinking that the price for 20 picks was too good to be true. They were. I have played my guitar for maybe a total of 3 hours since getting them. In that 3 hour frame, I've broken seven picks. I very rarely break picks and when I do, it's after using them for a very long time. I will never buy these picks again. I suggest you do the same.
