I bought this with high expectation because I was impressed with marshall bluetooth speakers. I had this for about a month now and I have to say they should definitely not advertise as &#34;monitor headphone&#34;<br />In terms of sound quality, I was very much disappointed.<br />The headphone had good high frequency response but its strong bass ruined the balance of most music I listened to.<br />Removing the filter further ruined the balance with strong bass and high treble.<br />This headphone is pretty much Dr.Dre + better high frequency response.<br />I went ahead and bought Sony MDR7506 3 days after I bought this headphone at half the price and I couldn't be more satisfied.
