&#34;I had to change my order due to someone breaking the original violin. I had to settle for a black one instead of a wooden in color one. Then the delivery was later then it was supposed to be so my child's grade was damaged due to the longer wait. Then once it arrives we did not get the extra strings that it was supposed to come with but a note was included saying it would be shipped shortly. Then upon putting the violin together we find the bow is completely unusable due to the fact almost all the hair was detached from the bow and one of the strings was busted. I call the company to complain and have the problem fixed and the customer service rep was very rude, didn't know anything about the items they were selling, didn't have correct account information, and tried to argue with me about how the situation was going to be handled. They are going to send us a new bow but now my daughters waiting again and her grade is continuing to drop due to these issues.<br /><br />Upon posting this original comment I was contacted by another customer service rep (Arthur) and he informs me that they will only correct my order if I agree to remove my negative feedback from the site. So I remove it and he states he will personally send out a full replacement and a refund for all the trouble.<br /><br />The bow and strings were supposed to be shipped on September 11th, 2013 with a 2 day delivery. The shipment did not arrive until September 16th, 2013 and the new bow was also busted, They did not mark the package as fragile so the bow was completely busted in half. I contacted them again and I'm informed they will Replace the whole order.He then informs me I will receive new tracking information on 3 different occasions and that did not occur. I finally had to threaten to get an attorney on this matter before I received the tracking info.<br /><br />Today I receive the new violin and once again the strings were not included in the case. I have had my fair share of this company,I am not dealing with them every again. They are very quick to get the negative feedback removed so other customers can not see them before placing their orders but they have no sense of customer service, loyalty to the customers, or care for the products they are selling.<br /><br />I placed the original order on August 29th, 2013 and as of today September 21st, 2013 the order is still not actually corrected.<br /><br />This was my first time ever using Amazon and I will always remember this experience before I ever us them again.&#34;
