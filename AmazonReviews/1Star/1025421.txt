Received this dolly, went to open it up and the collapsing string popped right out of its housing. Thus making the arm locked in folding place and unable to use. Sent it back, received a SECOND one. EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED RIGHT AWAY!<br /><br />So, I can't comment on the actual dolly part, since we never were able to use it for the purpose that we bought it for!<br /><br />Such a shoddy product. The clasp used to hold the collapsing string couldn't hold a strand of hair, let alone the metal string.
