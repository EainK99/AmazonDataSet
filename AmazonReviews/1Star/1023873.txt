Disclosure:  I don't own this product, and I don't plan on buying it.  The reason I am writing is that, as a cellist, eighteen of the nineteen existing reviews of the OMB Super-Sensitive Cello Wolf Tone Eliminator appear to be written by &#34;customers&#34; who don't own the product.  All of the comments are so generic as to suggest zero understanding of what a wolf suppressor actually does.  I see comments such as, ‘yeah.its good for everthing!it works’ and ‘It is perfect.everything's good!’ and ‘received everything!good!’ and ‘good 4 used!’ and ‘looks quality.’  Notice the similarity in writing style... likely not English as a primary language.  Real cellists care how the product sounds, not how it looks.  Does the screw stay tight?  Does the nickel plating peel off?  Is the rubber soft?  Does it leave marks on the string?  In over forty years of cello playing, I've never seen anybody use FOUR wolf suppressors.  That's a fake review if ever I saw one.  No instrument is that bad, not even the cheapest plywood cello.  No wonder cellists are shying away from this product — we're not that stupid.  Beware the phony five star reviews.  Shame on you Amazon!
