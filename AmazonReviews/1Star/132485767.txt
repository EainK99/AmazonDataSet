Well to start off, the picture is not what I got. As you can see there are three tone/volume knobs, but it only came with two. Moreover, it does not fit my strat. It is about an inch short length wise, so I have no idea what guitar this actually fits. Waiting about a month, because it comes from China is understandable, but once I get it, and it doesn't fit, nor is it what I thought I was getting, I was quite disappointed.<br /><br />As far as the pickups, who knows, because the darn thing is just sitting in a box until I can find a HSH pick guard that I know will fit my guitar, and has the two tone/volume knob holes.<br /><br />Overall, it is not worth it, due to the limited specs and the waiting. So for now, it will just sit in the box, and lesson learned.
