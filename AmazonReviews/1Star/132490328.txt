Poor construction, poor finish, poor sound. I hate to say it but this is a really weak instrument.  Had to return mine after it came in really bad shape with the strap pin broken, the paint job ruined, paint bubbles near the cutaways and the worst set up I have witnessed from a mailed instrument.. You always expect to set it up a bit when you receive something through mail but this was beyond that level... The electronics are really quiet in the worst way, meaning the volume is very weak when compared to other budget instruments.  The tone is sort of flat... Not much of a character or a deepness... I wouldn't recommend this instrument net to any serious musician or aspiring musician, this bass is sort of a toy, and a very cheaply made one, if I may add. Historically bad...
