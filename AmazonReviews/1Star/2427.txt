I ordered three of these, on the theory that Id get at least a couple of good ones.  The gold one, would not pair, no matter what.  the Black one the power switch was not connected to the circuit board, the black and red, worked alright, though if I had phone, and media connected to my Note 4, the answer button, or hangup button, would not work.  Since I mostly used it for listening to music, I felt I could deal with that.  Now, less than 6 months later, the only semi-corking one, has decided that it will no longer charge, and is dead.  Ill order from a reputable vendor, and give al these copies a pass from now on.
