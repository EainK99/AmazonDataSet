Nothing personal about this item, I'm sure it holds the Yamaha keyboard that it's specifically made for very well.  I do have a problem with Amazon's 30 day return policy.  I bought this for my mom's birthday (Aug) and unfortunately I did it a couple of months in advance (Jun) and as it turns out she doesn't need it anymore and since I've gone over the 30 day return policy I'm stuck with a couple of tubes intended to hold up a specific Yamaha and really can't be used for anything else.  Lesson to be learned:  If this is a gift, don't purchase early and you might consider a universal stand so that if you get stuck with it you can use it for another purpose like hanging laundry, ironing, etc. and the universal stands are less expensive!
