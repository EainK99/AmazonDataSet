THE ITEM WAS RECEIVED ON TIME HOWEVER I HAD IT IN PACKAGE FOR ABOUT 60 DAYS AND WHEN I TRIED TO USE IT, IT DOESNT WORK. I HAD IT IN THE PACKAGE FOR 60 DAYS AS I DID REALIZE THAT THE CABLE DID COME WITH IT. I ORDERED 4 DIFFERENT CABLES AND A MIXER TRYING TO GET THIS THING TO WORK BUT IT DIDNT. IT HAS A CONSTANT HUMMING ONCE YOU TOUST THE MIC. APPEARS THERE IS A SHORT ON THE MIC AND I CAN SEEEM TO RESOLVE.<br />SUPPLIERS SAY THIS WAS A 30 DAY RETURN POLICY.<br />NOW I AM STUCK WITH THIS USELESS JUNK.
