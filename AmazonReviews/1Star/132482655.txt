I'm really not picky when it comes to most things, and I paid very little ($3?) for this capo, but I just can't use it. The tension is just too high -- it takes two hands for me to open it wide enough to put on my neck. Almost to the point where I worry that it will damage the neck. Definitely, definitely worth spending a little bit more for a quality capo that doesn't TAKE TWO HANDS TO OPEN. Seriously, don't buy this.
