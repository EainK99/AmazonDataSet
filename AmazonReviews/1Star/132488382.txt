This strap is simple and understated.  It functions just fine except for one thing; it took the finish off the neck of my acoustic guitar.  I was putting my guitar away every night (with the strap still attached) into it's hard case.  The point where the neck rested on the strap in the case started bubbling and peeling away.  At first I couldn't figure it out but a guitar tech told me that it was from the guitar being put away either on a stand or something else that was made of a material that didn't react well with the finish.  Since I don't put my guitar on a stand, only in it's case every night with the strap resting on that point on the neck that was now peeling away and since this only happened sometime after I bought the strap and started putting it in the case with my guitar, it must be the strap.<br /><br />Otherwise the strap is fine but I'm giving it a one star review because something is not right in the way it's made for this to happen.  I'm not sure if it's in the dying process or what but there's got to be some weird chemical thing going on.  Someone might say, &#34;it's cheap so what did you expect?&#34;  Not for the finish on my guitar to come off that's for sure.
