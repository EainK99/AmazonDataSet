I purchased this a while ago because my Halloween group was going to do a Disney Princess and Heroine theme, and this was going to be a prop for our Esmeralda. However, when I took it out of the box it looked as if the top had been water stained, part of it almost see-through and making me worry that it would break with any sort of use. It also doesn't sound very nice, the metal clanking together in a poor imitation of an actual tambourine's sound.
