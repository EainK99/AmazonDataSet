I bought this set for my 2 year old daughter. I was wooed by the price and thought \\"oh well if it is cheap, it is going to take a beating anyways.\\" Well long story short the set lasted all of 20 mins before pieces started breaking off and not because of rough play. The snare stand falls over constantly, the pieces of plastic that attach the drums to the base drum broke almost immediately. It is a hunk of trash. You may save a little dough with this toy over the more expensive sets but you will waste a lot of time putting it back together constantly, gluing pieces back on and then ultimately throwing it away. Totally bummed at this awful toy. It shouldn't even be sold!
