I didn't even get to try it out before it broke.  I took it out of the box and was pleased with the size of the wind screen itself and then started trying to attach it to a mic stand to see how well it worked.  Immediately upon tightening down the thumb screw, the little round plastic thing on the end of the screw split right down the middle (see the picture).  It seems to be made of the cheapest plastic possible.  I'll attempt to use this thing somehow....I'll probably just have to tape it onto the stand, which is a shame.
