As many others have stated, the quality control for this device is horrible. My unit refused to identify itself via USB no matter what I did (clean installation, beta drivers, etc). I am extremely comfortable with tech and upon looking into the problem it appears several of these devices are lemons right out of the box. Presonus support is a joke and offers nothing but knowledge base thread links which do not resolve the problem. Additionally, if you're running Windows 8 it's an entirely different can of worms, but I was on 7 x64.<br /><br />I will be returning the device as soon as possible and trying a different manufacturer.<br /><br />Buyer beware, you're getting what you pay for when it comes to this device and build quality, and Presonus has some of the worst customer support I've ever seen.
