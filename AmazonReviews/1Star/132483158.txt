At $200 the Sony MDR-X10 is far better.  I have had the Sony for a while and was looking for something better.  The reviews for the Sennheiser HD 650 were so great that I thought I found the headphones for me.  I received the Sennheiser yesterday, and was so disappointed in the quality of the sound coming out.  Even at full volume, it seemed that I was only listening at half volume or less.  Subtle sounds were lost, as was the \\"boom\\" \\"boom\\" of the base.  I was expecting so much more for $500.  I highly recommend the Sony product.
