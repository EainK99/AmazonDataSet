Don't waste your money on this poor excuse for an acoustic guitar pick-up. The first one which I had installed by a professional sounded like crap and had un unbearable hum. I brought it back and he tried at least three more of these which produced similar disappointing results. I finally bit the bullet, bought a $230.00 Seymour Duncan Mag Mic and now my Mini sounds like a dream! Only now I have the Taylor pick-up in a drawer and wasted a hundred bucks on it. Very disappointed that Taylor would produce such trash since they are known for their high quality and customer satisfaction.
