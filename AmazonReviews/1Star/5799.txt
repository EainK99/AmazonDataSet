I bought this tuner and it seemed to work fine?? A week later, after only a few use's, this little sucker go's crazy and just flashes random letters. Tried a new battery, and that didn't help so I chunked it...... Now it's working right ;-),,,,,,,,,,,,, Good Luck, but I'd try the Pitchhawk- G2!!! Much better tuner!
