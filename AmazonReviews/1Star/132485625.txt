I bought this thinking it would last me forever because I would use it so little. The cd stopped taking CD'S after having it a year. I probably used it less than 30 CD'S. I bought it from Kingdom and they quickly told me they do no repairs. When I contacted Tascom they said it would be about 200 dollars for the cd drive and 100 to put it in but for an exact quote I would need to send it in.Even if it were 100 it would be too much. I was not thrilled with the unit.I felt that it would copy faster than mormal but it was adequate for my limited needs. The cassette sound off when I play it. It still works but sounds cheap to me. I hate writing a bad review but I think people should be aware.Almost all reviews are 5 star and mine would have been a 4 star if I had reviewed when I first purchased it.<br />I would like to know of those that have had it for over a year or who have used it for a numbed of CD'S how it has worked for them.
