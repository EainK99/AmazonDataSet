Purchased a new guitar yet received one with hand prints all over it, well worn strings and pick scratches.  It had been sealed then resealed with tape 2 more times (total of 3 layers of tape) with the last layer of taping being Line 6.  Tried on 3 amps and same issue, completely distorted sound.  Getting double notes out of playing a single string on the acoustic 6 string mode.  Completely unusable.<br /><br />Ordered a 2nd Line 6 out and I knew it was headed for issues when I could tell this &#34;new&#34; guitar had also been opened and resealed twice beyond the original tape from Line 6.  This one was slightly better meaning the distortion was not so bad that it scared the kids next door.  However, it was completely useless.<br /><br />So two &#34;new&#34; guitars that were defective to the point they could not be used.  Each was sealed twice with Line 6 Tape plus once with clear tape.  From this it is clear that Line 6 sent out these guitars which then were opened, played, retaped and returned to Line 6.  Line 6 just retaped them without so much as cleaning the dirty hand prints off the and they then sold these defective guitars as if they were functional and new.<br /><br />I contacted Line 6 to try to find out how I could get a 3rd one (they had absolutely no concern about all my time they wasted) and their suggestion was to order a 3rd one and then return it to Line 6 if it did not work.  I asked them if there was any way to get one that did work to me (local dealers or could they ship a functional one to me direct) and they had no other options and they made it clear they did not want to be on the phone to try to get a working guitar into my hands.<br /><br />Summary:  Awful quality, awful customer service from Line 6 and selling used guitars by Line 6 as if they were no guitars.<br /><br />I can not comment on what the sound might be for a functional guitar since Line 6 sent two defective guitars and had no desire to resolve the problem!
