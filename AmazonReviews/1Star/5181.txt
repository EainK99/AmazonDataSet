Difficult to use.  Uncomfortable, but sound quality is good.  Will be returning them. Update 11/02/15  Returned this headset to Grand Electronics, on July 7, 2015. at their request .their request.   As a result of my review, they contacted me and said they would replace them, so that I could update my review.  Have had no response.  No new headset, no nothing. This is my update.
