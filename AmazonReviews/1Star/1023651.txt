I liked this a lot at first, but carrying it by the shoulder strap pulls at some of the corner seams and they started coming apart. It's getting really bad now, two years from purchase.<br /><br />The worst part is that Pedaltrain has reneged on their warranty. I purchased this largely because it came with a lifetime warranty on all parts. Since the time of my purchase, they've changed their policy to only cover the board itself—cases are now covered by a 1-year warranty. That's fine, they can do that for new purchases, but they decided that the new policy applies retroactively. So the fact that I purchased a board with a lifetime warranty means nothing. They're refusing to honor my warranty.
