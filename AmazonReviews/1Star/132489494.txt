I have been playing with promark drumsticks for about 15yrs.  I opened the box and noticed the sticks looked funny.  When compared to my other promark sticks i noticed the taper was not even similar and the nylon tips were very different or elongated and slightly pointy.  One time I attempted to pay drums with bargain sticks and this is what theses look like except for the promark packaging and logo's.  I ordered four pairs of sticks and one stick is cracked half way through.  In fifteen years of using promark sticks I have never seen a drumstick (New in the box) that was damaged.  I don't believe these are true promark sticks but actually fakes.  If they are not fake then I got four sets of 5A drumsticks that don't look anywhere close to the 5A sticks that I have been using for years.<br /><br />*Update* 10/11/2013<br />I contacted promark and informed them that I believed I received fake sticks.  I never asked for replacements but they offered them and are sending me two more pairs than I purchased.  I will be sending the junk sticks back to promark in anticipation of an explanation.  Based on promark's customer service I won't be afraid to purchase their products in the future.
