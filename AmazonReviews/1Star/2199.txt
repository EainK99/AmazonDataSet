Recommend not buying...the plastic will eventually &#34;melt&#34;  causing an extremely sticky material that you will not be able to touch without having the residue on your hands.  I called the company:  the singing machine to discuss and they tried to blame it on me and how it was stored.  It's poor plastic but they won't admit it.
