This review is for the 185 lav when used with the \\"presenter\\" receiver which it is normally packed with. Bought this 185 and plugged it into the mixer and it seemed to work so I left for the night. The next day the seminar speaker used it. He stood 20 feet away from the receiver. When he walked further than 20 feet or behind anyone or anything (such as a pillar) it dropped. I stopped the seminar in the middle of 300 guests to switch channels. no luck. I stopped him again to switch frequencies. No luck. When it was over the president came up to me and said, \\"You ruined the event.\\" I took full responsibility but no, I didn't. Sure ruined our event with the cheapest piece of junk I've ever laid eyes on in my 30 years of doing audio. As a graduated audio engineer, I've worked with hundreds of mics and systems in my lifetime. In all my life I have never ever seen or held a cheaper mic in all my life. This garbage isn't suited to give to your 2 year old to play with in the car. It's featherlight and feel like it's made of thin plastic with nothing inside. The receiver is super thin and cheaply made. The mic is equally thin and light as if it is a toy. The worst part is, for $100 more I could have got the nice RE2 from EV which has awesome ratings and lasts for 10+ years. What the heck was I thinking? I'll never ever buy another sure product as long as I live and neither should you. Sure sold out and now they simply suck. They now specialize in selling cheap dollar store Chinese junk. What a horrible terrible product experience. Sure, you used to be such an amazing company with a rich audio history, why did you sell your soul to the devil? You ruined my reputation because I banked on you. I won't make that mistake again.
