I filtered one resivour through this filter, worked great. The second time I filled the top resivour no water filtered at all. This happened with two of these filters. I called ProPur they said to take the green side scratch pad of a sponge and scratch the filters for a few minutes which should remove blockage. I tried this several times still does not work. ProPur sent me a new filter, same problem. Not sure what the problem is but these are expensive paper weights. Do not buy these.
