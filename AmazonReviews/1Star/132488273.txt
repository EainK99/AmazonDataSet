I got this expecting I would get what I payed for. I had it for a few days before it started giving me issues. Makes loud squeels no matter how ajusted. If the cord is wiggled (The part that goes into the transmitter) the sound cuts out. This issue is not just with this wireless set. This happens with all wireless sets with this style of input jack on the transmitters. DO NOT get a wireless unit with this style of input on the transmitter. You will have payed for nothing but trouble.
