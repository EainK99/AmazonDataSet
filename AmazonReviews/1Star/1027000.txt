Dead on arrival. So frustrating. Three sets of brand new, out of the packaging batteries and nothing. Unit won't function at all. Not in reverse. Not forward. Also, feels incredibly cheap. Thin, plastic garbage. Ernie Ball should be ashamed of themselves. Total junk. Have just ordered the Planet Waves attachment for cordless drills/screwdrivers.
