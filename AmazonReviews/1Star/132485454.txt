I bought this pack of three mics from New Harbor and just opened the package to use for a job. I discovered the clip to attach the mic to clothing was missing on one of the mics. New Harbor says they can't do anything about the missing mic clip because &#34;the warranty for this item is expired.&#34;<br /><br />Moral of story: Open your packages and examine the contents as soon as you get them - even if it will be a couple months until you will use the item.
