I bought this item for a couple reasons.  My wife needs some height in the seat of our truck and it's hard to find a cushion that is firm enough for her.  I thought by pumping this as firm as I wanted, would work.  Also, seemed to be a great price.<br /><br />The idea of this is great, however, the valve is terrible.  It didn't hold air from the day I received it.  Now, the valve is so loose, that it won't even stay in.  I would not recommend this item at all.  It's useless.
