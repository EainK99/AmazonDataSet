worked ok for 20 hrs. then would quit working . replaced it 3 times over 8 months. would not recommend.(china low quality) other people have had the same problem, that's being going on for 4yrs that i know of.  i recommend Fiio dac/amps, or Schiit dac/amp products made USA reasonably priced very good quality.
