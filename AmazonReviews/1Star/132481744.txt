What is being sold here is a version published over 30 years after the composer's death for 6 strings, rather than the original for 23 strings. Amazon policy apparently is not to take full responsibility for this, making me pay shipping both ways for what is in fact THE WRONG ITEM. Don't buy scores offered through Amazon (at least without checking with the seller first). Buy them through businesses that know music.
