I had better luck soldering and did a dozen pieces on my boat including using just one 3 light section for all of my deck light fixtures. I can not keep the connector from damaging the line and thus not transfering voltage to another pin there by changing the color a little for each strip. At all my points I had lower votages on 2 terminals and like 14 on the color is should have been (blue red green) but the strip was perfectly lit. If I tested the solder joints back towards the power supply before the terminal connectors through the rubber waterproof gel I had normal voltage. So these crimps are damaging the line somehow. I have to shorten all my cuts I made, solder everything, but have short runs, or start all over. Just sucks. I thought the color change was from voltage drop, so I bought some amplifiers, turns out I'm getting strong voltage on the good joints. Just wish they had a good connector I could find. I bought 3 packs of these and it was a waste.
