Shalom,<br />We have blown many a shofar and know a good one from a bad one to a raw horn for doing your own. This horn is for someone who wants to make their own shofar and do all the work. It was still somewhat raw inside, even slightly red and hence very stinky. The mouth piece was way to small, had a sharp edge and was very difficult to blow even for someone with experience. The over all sound even on a good blow was way to high and did not have that rich quality a good shofar has. The other end was was very thin and cracked on one side. The outside had not been finished at all, just a few rough sand marks. The price was comparable to finished shofars of the same size and description online. For a raw shofar it was way over-priced and not good for anything but a dog's chew toy. It wasn't even good enough to hang as decoration - rather ugly. We are sending it back and will look elsewhere. Sorry but zero stars :(  If you want a raw shofar, don't pay this price - contact a sheep farm and ask for the name of their butcher.
