A seen in pictures it should have been a 2 wire set up.  Mine came as 4 wire which I did not want.  The wiring was not long enough to solder to the pots outside of the guitar so i really had to work them in tight which made for a sloppy job.  The bridge pick up is not as hot as stated and the neck pick up I received had a short to ground in one of the coils. But they look cool!  Not cool at all!
