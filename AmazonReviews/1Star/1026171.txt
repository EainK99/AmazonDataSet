OK. Here is the thing. One star is a very bad review and the unit has stuff about it that deserves much better, but read on.<br /><br />I have been gigging as a part-time musician for 30 years. I am a bass player and used to lugging around lots of heavy gear. I also have a bad back. I personally like gear like Ampeg tube amps and SWR for their sound. The problem, of course is the weight. I always asked myself why this stuff weights so damn much!  I am currently in a band that plays casual events and outdoor gigs. The band has employed a Yamaha powered mixer,with heavy Peavey mains and monitor speakers. The owner of that system has had the job of loading it up and carting it to our various gigs. Too much.<br /><br />Finally, we had a pow-wow and decided to go 21st Century. We demo'd two Bose L1 Model II systems, one with B! and the other with B2. We LOVED the sound and the PA owner loved the weight and simplicity. We decided to invest. The two systems run all our VOX, three guitars and my bass. We rehearsed using the new set up for a couple of weeks. Then we had our first gig with it last week.<br /><br />Well the system stumbled majorly right out of the gates. We set it up at the gig site and one of the L1 base (not bass) units failed. It would not send signal to the towers. The B2 modules worked, but so what? We were dead in the water. We ended up rigging things so we could at least play enough tunes that the crowd could hear. I played bass through the half-dead unit and the rest of us went through the other L1. We had to cut one guitarist out and we had to share two mikes. My bass sounded like you would expect, all subwoofer and no presence. But we got through.<br /><br />Bose promptly replaced the L1 base and said they only have a 1% failure rate. However, I just read another negative review here on Amazon with a similar problem. So that is 2 out of some 20 or so reviews that list complete failure as a problem with these systems.<br /><br />I understand that things fail and nothing is perfect, but in my 30 years of playing I have had very few equipment failures. And NEVER one from a brand new system. Never a major failure on the first stage use. I think the reason why certain companies that produce pro- music gear for working musicians are still around is that they build their stuff to military specs and realize that the stuff needs to work right, even after having it fall off the back of a truck, getting drenched in beer, in/outs plugged in the wrong way and played way too loud for way too long.<br /><br />After my negative experience, I seriously question if Bose understands this and if their stuff - as great sounding as it is - is made for the rigors of gigging. It is one thing to build a great home stereo, another completely to handle pro music. If you are a working musician, you understand all too well the terror of having your equipment fail before or during a gig. This is compounded by the system like the L1 where everything is going through one or two units. No fall back. We will try again and I will update this review as time goes on. I am hoping this was a 1 in a 100 event, but even that sounds high it you think about it...
