So I bought this in order to do some basic outline tracks in Garage Band.<br /><br />1. Install won't work as it is not a recognized developer by Apple. - Good job Jurgen & Co.<br />2. When I drop my security settings I still got an install error as the piece of junk can't find its own files.<br />3. Sent an email to Dieter, Han, Frau Farbissina & Franz and it took 3 seeks to hear back and then it was just a generic email with no solutions.<br />4. Uninstall all of the files associated with this prime example of piss poor design and user experience<br />5. Reinstalled.  Same issues.<br />6.  Tried to get it to by pass its own crappy software and emulators and go directly into GB but that failed too.<br /><br />Spend an extra 50 buck and get something that actually works and has some type quasi-decent customer service.<br /><br />On the plus side, if you want to give yourself a migraine of epic proportions, then this is the right product for you.
