The advertised leads are shown to have gold-plated end-clips and be &#34;oxygen free copper.&#34;  What I got was a 'made in China' bubble pack with tin end-clips and no mention of oxygen-free copper leads (a major advertising point).  What I got does NOT look like what is shown in the photo next to this 'Review Your Purchases' composition window.  The seller tells me I can send them back to Canada at my own expense - insured of course, and costing more than I was billed for the items.  Bait and switch for sure - A RIP OFF!
