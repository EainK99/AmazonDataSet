I bought these drums a couple years ago. Went to use them one day and the bass drum was cracked almost all the way through and just about front to back. I contact yamaha customer support who then tells me that they don't make the color any more and it will be 2 months before they can replace it. Two months goes by and I contact them again. This time I am told four more months. They offered to repair it until the new one is made. I sent it in for repair and they send it back with some glue in the crack but otherwise exactly the same as it was before (unusable). I begged them to just send me a current color that will some what go with it and I would be fine with that. They refused to send one of a different color. I was a big yamaha fan yesterday; today I will never buy another yamaha anything.
