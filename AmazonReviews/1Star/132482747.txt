Windows installed the microphone as soon as I plugged it in, without trouble.<br /><br />When I record from it, my voice sounds OK.  However, there is always a buzzing background noise about -32 dB below the voice peak level.  Adjusting the microphone level in Control panel &#62; Sound &#62; Recording &#62; Levels adjusts the voice and noise levels proportionately.  Moving the microphone around didn't change the buzz.  I can't use it.<br /><br />I also noticed that the mute switch causes a loud POP in the audio when it moves from ON to OFF, and vice versa.<br /><br />The stand, clip, and microphone body are all light plastic, but are strong enough.  The 10 foot USB cord is nice.<br /><br />I would have put up with the POPs, but the buzz is unacceptable.
