I bought this software in the hope of it producing good guitar sounds. Sadly it did not. I found the sound disappointing. Even sadder, I found this out only after I had registered the software - you can't use it until you've registered it. I asked if Notion would cancel my registration so that I could re-sell it, but was told \\"We do not support the re-selling of this software\\"; in other words: \\"You're stuck with it, Mate, even if you find it a waste of time.\\"<br />GuitarPro 6 allow you to download a reduced version of their software so you can assess it before you buy. Why can't Notion do something like that with Progression 2? It might leave fewer bitter and resentful customers like me. In my opinion, this software is best avoided.
