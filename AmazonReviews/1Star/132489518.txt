I can't say it would have been better to just lean my guitar up against the wall, as it did actually enclose my instrument, but this case is no where near the value it's price and description implies.  The hinges and locks are flimsy. The case would not close securely and the top of the case was still loose with all the latches secured. I could deform the the top of the case with light finger pressure. If you buy a case to protect and secure your instrument you need to look elsewhere. If you could even use the word \\"secure\\". The entire feel of the case is sub par.  I hate to write so negative a review, but this case at this price? Potential purchasers need to be warned off. I felt burned when I took it out of the shipping box.  The only good thing I can say about it is that it is indeed light.  Not a good purchase.
