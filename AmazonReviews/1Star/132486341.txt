I recently purchased this interface and it works the only problem is that when my headphones(work perfectly fine) are plugged into the unit sound  only comes out from one side of my headphones and when I export anything from cubase le 5 and other recording softwares it only plays through one side .....Idk if its the unit is bad or if I haven't configured it properly .....I NEED HELP
