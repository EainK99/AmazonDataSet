What a deal on price, eh?<br />Well, you get what you pay for...or not.<br />1) the shaft is too short and the washer is too thick...ergo, you cannot screw the lock nut down on the shaft once you have the shaft thru the guitar strap unless you find a thinner washer...note their picture...no extra length on the shaft.<br />2) having solved THAT problem, the strap side of this lock will NOT fit on my other existing shaller type strap buttons.<br />3) poorly engineered...lots of play<br />4) cheap-looking \\"plating\\"<br /><br />5) The strap button side...the one that goes on the guitar, is just slightly different from the schallers that I already have...was this to save a few bucks on metal?  was this to avert some patent infringement?<br /><br />Don't know...but either way, I wasted my money on these.  Now, if you don't mind the fact that the \\"gold\\" coating looks pretty cheap (maybe stick w/ nickle) and you only have these on ONE guitar...or you have these on ALL your guitars...might work for you.<br /><br />They seem poorly made, tho.  Would hate to have a $500-$2000 axe drop to the floor.<br />But that's just me
