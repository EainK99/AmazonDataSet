I had high hopes for this pedal, but was disappointed from the start.  Very loud hissing noise when the pedal was engaged.  No other pedals in the chain, and never had this problem with my rig before.  Sorry to say, but this hasn't been my first experience with poor product quality with Dunlop products.  I had an MXR Analog Chorus pedal that had knobs falling off out of the box.  Won't be buying their products in the future.
