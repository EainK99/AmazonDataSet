These seemed like a cool idea, and they're fine to practice on a pad.  So they're the perfect choice to play a drum pad on the beach.  But amazingly, they make even my son's Paiste 602 Ride and New Beat hats sound harsh.<br /><br />I think of them as being on a cymbal tone spectrum, and I never would have believed the difference could be this extreme.  If wood tips are a 1 on the tone scale, and nylon tips are a 3, these are way out in the teens.  Phenomenally bad tone, and I think my first 1 star rating.  Sorry Aquarian, love your drum heads, but you need to put softer tips on these!
