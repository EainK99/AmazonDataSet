Two tragic flaws, we bought four of them so this is an honest sampling. 1. they are broken and due to a design flaw (or an assembly line in China that is not gluing the end with enough glue) in that the XLR connector can simply... pull out when removing the connector, ripping the device apart - two of our four did this, and we are experienced with professional microphones. 2. None of these mics could be used with true phantom supply (as from a mixing board or a camera) without a 60 or 120 Hz hum, pretty much a hum that makes serious recording impossible.<br /><br />Used with an AA battery, and with lots of luck when plugging in and out the cord, the mic could be useful, but this Pyle PDMIC45 model really shouldn't have been put on the market so poorly designed - phantom circuit-wise - and so badly manufactured allowing the connector parts to be inadequately glued together.
