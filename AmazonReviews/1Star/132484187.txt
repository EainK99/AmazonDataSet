Sound quality was great when they worked, but I'm not an audiophile by any means. These were my first \\"real speakers\\" after having cheap logitechs throughout high school and college. I did research for about 2 weeks before I decided on these speakers. I really liked the price point for what they offered. I never had issues with the sound quality despite having them slightly below ear level. My desk is mounted on the wall pretty high (35 inches) so I tested them at ear level (lowering my chair) and below ear level (chair adjusted to normal height) and couldn't tell much of a difference. I know several other customers have had the issue of them burning out shortly after warranty, so please be advised. My speaker volume was never over 30% since I've owned them, and the first sign of trouble occurred after about 9 months of owning them. I noticed a slight crackling sound in the tweeter of the right speaker that occurred randomly.<br /><br />I just wanted to reinforce the fact that these speakers do not last, and customer support is very poor. I contacted customer support to see what the process was like if I wanted them repaired/replaced. They don't cover shipping, and they have a 2-4 week turnaround. Not only that, but they do not provide any updates on the status of your speakers while it is being worked on! Seems like they are a bit out of touch with what customers want out of products these days. Anyway, I was debating whether or not I wanted to follow through with the warranty when the crackling simply went away. I was relieved and happy thinking that my speakers magically fixed themselves. Fast forward 2 months and I am now hearing static-like noises emitted from BOTH speakers occasionally regardless of volume level.<br /><br />TL-DR: Speakers provide excellent sound quality for the price. They are not built to last. Customer service is terrible.
