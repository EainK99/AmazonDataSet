All I could hear is a bad hum. I could not even here the music being played on the record turntable. I even put a new 18 guage ground wire and I ran the wires the way the book said. there are white and red and ground comming out of the turntable. I took 2 new 12 guage speaker cables bought with the rca ends on them. I hooked white end to white to the turntable then to the white of the pile pro. Then red end and hooked it to the red of the turntable than hooked to the pyle pro. than I took the white end again and hooked to the pile and then taken the other end I hooked to the Onkyo TX NR 616 RECEIVER. Then I took the red end again and hooked it to the pyle pro than hooking the other end of the red end to Onkyo TX NR 616 RECEIVER. I hooked up a brand new 18 Guage wire from the ground of the Phono to the pyle-pro. ALL I HERD WAS A HUM AND RINKIDINKI AND THAT WAS IT. I wrote out my steps of how I hooked it up. I my appion a waiste of money JUNK! Than I had to pay to have it ship it back to 3 KING SALES I will never buy from them again
