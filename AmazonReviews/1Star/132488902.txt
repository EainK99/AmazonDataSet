I purchased one of these 3 years ago for my wife's desk area. After daily, albeit gentle use, one of the switches broke completely allowing the inner electrical contacts to be exposed after about a year of use. Just recently a second switch broke the same way. As this is a terrible shock hazard we have had to tape over them and move the items that were plugged into them into other outlets. I'm disappointed that it hasn't lasted longer than it has and I wouldn't recommend that others purchase it because of the electrical shock danger.
