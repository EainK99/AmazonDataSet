Product was fine but it was a gift that was duplicated. Their &#34;returns&#34; option for phone support was hell on earth. Crazy long hold times, forcing you to hang up in frustration.<br /><br />I eventually got through (as I my frequent last resort) by selecting&#34;sales&#34; option on phone.<br /><br />To get a refund, i had to pay the return shipping cost, which was more than the cost of the product and, for some strange reason, exponentially more than the original shipping cost.<br /><br />Don't buy this product, unless you knowvfor certain you won't need to return it<br />I gave them 1 star for their awful customer service. It would have been zero stars, if that option was available.
