We bought this in August 2013. After school start, in first music lesson, the music teacher of my son called us and pointed out couple of serious defects and said this cannot be used as a music instrument. We did not believe him and bring it to a local music store. A cello maker owns the store. After careful inspection, he also pointed out exact same defects and said it is a piece of junk. He said he can try to fix the defects for $50 but cannot guarantee it will work. So, we eat the bullet, pay the return shipping fee, return it last week, just before 30-days policy limit. Since they do not reimburse the shipping fees, it cost us $100 to learn never buy a cello on-line. I would give zero star, but no such option here.
