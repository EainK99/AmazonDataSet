This trombone came in a box that looked like it was sealed with spit,just by lifting it up it fell apart, and I knew then that what was sold to me was a POS. I took out the horn and the first thing I checked was the slide, and as suspected, the slide could not go past 3rd position, so now I have a great trombone looking lamp, Mendini or Cecilio, whatever, you suck and so do the instruments you manufacture and sell and Amazon is an acomplace.
