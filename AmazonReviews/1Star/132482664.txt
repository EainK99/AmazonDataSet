I have a lot of 3.5mm cables and extensions, but wanted one specifically for my boompole, so I got to use it with my VideoMic from Rode. The price was higher than other brands, so I was expecting a high-quality cable; But what I got was a very very thin cable, thinner than any other of the cables I had. When I plugged it in, I noticed some problems with the signal and always have static when the cable moves a little bit. Go to your local music store and buy a good cable 'cause this one is total waste of money. If you're planning to use it for booming, better buy an XLR cable with 3.5mm adapters and you won't regret it; It's longer and you can't beat that quality.
