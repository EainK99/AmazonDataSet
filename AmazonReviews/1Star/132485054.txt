I received the guitar a couple of days ago.  I assembled it following the user manual and powered  it via usb. The strings seemed to work but the fretboard simply did not work.  I wasn't able to  get any chord.  Tried it many times and now I am returning it.  Both items in my last order were broken (What are the odds)
