We purchased 2 of these headsets to use and one is used 3 times a week for 1 hour and the other one was used maybe once a month, if that.  If you broke that down the 1st microphone was used approximately 125 times and the 2nd microphone was used approximately 8 times.  After 10 months, neither of them work.  What a waste of money.  I am going to send a request to the seller and let them know my dilemma and hope that they exchange them for a new product.  If they do then I will be happy, if not, the I will never order from this company again.  Stay tuned for the outcome!!!
