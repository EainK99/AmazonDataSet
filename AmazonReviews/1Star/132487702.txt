Listen, I know what its like to be a dj/soundperson on a budget. I really do, but-there comes a time when you MUST LISTEN to the experienced words of those that have learned the hard way.<br />  I had read the reviews of others on this item and I had figured that there were enough good reviews to outweigh the bad.So, I purchased this item for an outdoor wedding and reception that I provided sound for yesterday, only to deal with voice dropouts, screeching sound-overloads and static. I had to place my hand around the antenna's through half the ceremony just to keep the reverend's mic. from dropping out.<br />  I STRONGLY ADVISE everyone to not even consider wasting your money,time & reputation by using this item.<br />I will be returning this wireless system.
