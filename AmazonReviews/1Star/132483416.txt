Bought this for my daughter for Christmas last year. She loved it and has fun playing it, however it is cheaply made and the A-flat key bent very easily. It messed up within the first two months of band. I also play the flute and have never encountered a flute made from such soft (easy-to-bend) material!! I wouldn't recommend this even as a first-time flute for anyone.
