I purchased this interface used back in February and it performed OK up until yesterday.  I plugged in a XLR cable and got the &#34;Peak Lines of Death&#34;.  A quick online search shows that this is a VERY common ending to M-Track's life.<br /><br />It did work OK for the time I used it (maybe rented it is more accurate).  I always had noice through my Yamaha monitors, especially during reboots of my system (very loud popping with the PC's restart).<br /><br />I have had a MobilePre for many years and I still use it to record but that unit doesn't get the monitors enough juice.  I have ordered a Focusrite Saffire 6 to replace the M-Track, hopefully that unit will last longer!
