First of all I would like to say amazon reviews and the way they keep listing reviews for the WRONG case is what tricked me this time.<br />I purchased the supcase and i thought i was getting the ones i saw in the video reviews below.. but no they seem to have a flap whereas mine has a band as well as being able to stand upright in portrait mode.<br />This case can not do that very well it is not sturdy/rigid enough to hold the weight of the nexus 7 when in portrait and just topples over and it doesnt even fit on one of the ridges supposed to be keeping it in place at a good angle and the other ridge makes it almost lie down in portrait mode.. very disappointed with this false advertising and use of videos of other products in reviews for this item.<br />Also it is very thick and clunky making it almost 3times as thick as without a case which seems very odd.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE
