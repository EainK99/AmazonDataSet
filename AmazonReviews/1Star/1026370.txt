The dampit came in pieces- rubber &#34;washer&#34; separate and too small for dampit to fit through. Finally installed, but few days into it when checking on cello I couldn't find the dampit. Apparently it fell into cello and now I have to figure out how to extract it. Probably will go to violin shop for help. Wish I never bought it...
