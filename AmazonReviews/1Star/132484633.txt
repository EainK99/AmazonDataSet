I canceled this order immediately because I did not have the option to gift wrap it towards the end of the transaction.  I then ordered it again with gift wrapping.  Both were shipped and charged to my credit card.  I cant make the person that I was sending the gift return is now so I am stuck with the bill.  Not impressed!
