To give an idea of what the keys feel like to play, imagine loading a hard spring under each key then spilling orange juice all over the keyboard. I presume this is the \\"partially weighted\\" feel?<br /><br />The velocity response is useless considering it requires so much effort to press a key in the first place. The reduced size of the keys wouldn't be so bad were the keys a little lighter. The end result is something which is simply painful to play. If you plan on just whacking one key at a time, then it's probably fine, but if you want to play a chord with even a modicum of expression, you'll probably just get frustrated with this device.
