I'd heard that these cables had issues pulling out of the plug but was surprised to find out how quickly mine failed.  I plugged in for a warmup before first gig using the cable and it was inop.  Glad this didn't happen while playing.  Also, the on/off button is awkward.  Replaced this with auto-switched cable from Audiopile.net.  Much happier with that
