I am a beginner in harmonica.  Bought it so I can learn the basic.<br /><br />The problem is one of the key was wrong.<br />One day, I heard my friends play the harmonica and ask him to teach me.<br />I follow the note but can't play the same note.<br />At last, I clean his harmonica and play it on his, then I realized mine has a wrong note.<br /><br />I was unable to return it because when I realized it today, it has already been 3 months. =(<br />I will probably buy another one.  Hopefully, this time I got better luck.
