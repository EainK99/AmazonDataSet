The thumbwheel on my recorder began to lock up whenever I moved it up with less than 3 days of use. I was on vacation so I could not return it to Amazon, as I shipped all my audio and video gear ahead and back by ground services.<br /><br />When I got home, I got an RA number from the Zoom service representative, which is Samson Tech of Hauppage NY.<br /><br />The person giving me the RA number stated the MINIMUM turn-around time is 7-8 weeks. (over 2 months with shipping)<br /><br />I am going to see if my credit card company has a perk to replace this broken unit. 2 months for a $180 piece of consumer gear is terrible support.
