This product seemed to function pretty well up until about a month and a half since I bought it. It no longer makes a sound when I turn it on. Its pretty disappointing that the product couldn't even last two months. If I would have known that the quality of this product was so poor, I probably wouldn't have paid more than $20 for it.
