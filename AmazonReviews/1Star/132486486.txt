This was a pretty expensive piece of equipment that I couldn't figure out how to use. Apparently I'm the only one who couldn't figure out how to use this thing. I read the entire manual, searched the internet, and then promptly lost a 90 minute interview. The memory card ran out of memory!!? Too many holes, inputs, outputs and buttons. I got a tripod with it, that naturally doesn't actually go with it.<br /><br />I'm admittedly technologically challenged, but in buying what is essentially a tape recorder, for $299 (including all accessories) I would have expected a very simple plug and play and upload/download machine.<br /><br />In searching the internet for some assistance, again, no help and I got the feeling I was the only one having trouble. Also no help from Austin Bazaar and no return policy. I didn't keep the packaging anyway-I assumed it would just work-or if I didn't the retailer would take it back.<br /><br />If you are looking for a simple recording device, this ain't it.
