We build trade show exhibits and the connectors were to be used to connect some strips of LED light tape. We've purchased this kind of stuff before and we're happy to find it here on Amazon at such a great price.  However, in this case, we got what we paid for.  These were unusable and had to be returned. We would open the connectors, lay the tape and it would work fine.  Once we closed the connector, the lights no longer worked.<br /><br />The only good part is that we purchased them from Amazon, so the return was easy enough.
