We hosted a seminar at my job so my boss gave me $400. I bought this 185 and plugged it into the mixer. It seemed to work so I left for the night. The next day the seminar speaker used it. He stood 20 feet away from the receiver. When he walked further than 20 feet or behind anyone or anything (such as a concrete pillar) it dropped signal. I stopped the seminar in the middle of 300 guests to switch channels. no luck. I stopped him again to switch frequencies. No luck. When it was over the president came up to me and said, \\"You ruined the event.\\" I took full responsibility but no, I didn't. Sure ruined our event with the cheapest piece of junk I've ever laid eyes on in my 30 years of doing audio. As a graduated audio engineer, I've worked with hundreds of mics and systems in my lifetime. In all my life I have never ever seen or held a cheaper mic in all my life. This garbage isn't suited to give to your 2 year old to play with in the car. It's featherlight and feels like it's made of thin plastic with nothing inside. The receiver is super thin and cheaply made. The plastic hinges look as if they will break very easily. The mic is equally thin and light as if it is a toy. The worst part is, for $100 more I could have got the nice RE2 from EV which I've been using since it came out a few years back with no problems. What the heck was I thinking? Avoid this product and avoid headaches. Other than a few nice high end condensers and the legendary SM series, Sure sold out and now they simply suck. They now specialize in selling cheap dollar store junk. What a horrible product experience. Sure, you used to be such an amazing company with a rich audio history, why did you go the route of the almighty dollar and screw he consumer? You ruined my reputation because I banked on you. I won't make that mistake again.
