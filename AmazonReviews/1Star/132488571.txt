I bought theses for boyfriend for his mexican start. The it came in was broken and had pieces missing out of the box. The pick ups looked fine. I was very displeased to fine out after spending $80 and being a prime member to get a product with so much damage to it. This was very disappointing and has now caused me more problems then I needed.
