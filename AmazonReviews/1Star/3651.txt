Unit is junk. Tried to use it on a camera this past week. Would not pick up any sound. Tested it in a PA system - could pick up some sound but mostly scratching sounds. I gave as a gift and am ashamed it was so bad. Now I see I am out of the window to return it - will throw in the trash. If you want to exercise the warranty - it will cost you $20.00 + shipping to return it to Pyle.
