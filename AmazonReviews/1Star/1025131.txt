I really like the idea of these picks fitting under the nails for support, but Try as I might I could not get them to work properly. Fitting them is not easy the trimming has to be perfect and to be honest it would take me a number of sets before I could get it right. I bought a few sets, but it would take a few more just to get it close to right. It would be nice if they had some way of fitting these to each person.
