I bought this as a gift for my son.  He loved it and it was amazing according to him.  Then it just stopped working.  Other reviews said similar things but I bought it anyway.  Unfortunately it appears to be a regular problem with this pedal.  So I would pass it by if you're considering it.  It's a great pedal but unfortunately it's very unreliable.
