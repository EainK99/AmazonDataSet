I wish I could give this product less than one star. It's more like a decoration than anything. I read the one star reviews and disregarded them because there were so many 5 star reviews but I wish I had followed my instincts. I tried so hard to tune this thing and one of the tines sliced a chunk out of my pinky in the process. After I got it in tune it still sounded like shit and was damn near impossible to play because of the thickness of the tines.
