As a professional DJ for almost 20 years I know a fair amount about lighting. With that being said I was skeptical at buying such a cheap light and really the only reason I bought this light was for a one time job and a solid 5 start rating. I thought ok it must be good... I was wrong.<br /><br />My first order did not work at all. I called Chauvet before returning it to Amazon. They told me it was a common error \\"auto cycling through all the programs\\". They said I needed to send it in and they would fix it but I would have to pay for shipping and the repairs, so I just returned it to Amazon hoping that my replacement would be better. Nope, the replacement arrived with no audio adjustment knob (the knob was missing and the dial was rammed inside the unit), it also did not work properly and was missing most of the parts (the power cord for one). It looked like it was repaired and resold. Not Cool...<br /><br />I'm waiting for my third replacement to arrive although it won't be here for my job tomorrow maybe I can do something with it, if it works. It looks really cool when it is set up and working right.
