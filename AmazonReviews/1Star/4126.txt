Does not do what it is suppose to do, flimsy, cant fit more then 4 cymbals  without fighting to get the damn thing closed!! after all that, had to use a ratchet strap to keep it closed to where I felt safe enough to transport it!......although it did make a very good target!!  love Zildjian cymbals, I thought I was getting a safe to protect them!! once again a clear cut case of ...you get what you pay for!!  very disappointed!
