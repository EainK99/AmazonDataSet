Received the software today. It does not come with any songs, you must by them. It does not work directly with the pc, and I did not understand what the help guy from pcdj was telling me. It was a chat help, but the person treated me like I was crazy.<br /><br />Also, I can't send It back if you don't like it. I am so upset with this company. There is more, but I am just going to chalk it up as $99 to learn company's will take your money and treat you like crap....
