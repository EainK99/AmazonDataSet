I saw someone using one of these and immediately decided I had to have one. I ordered it and the swivel socket broke before I could even turn it on. Fluke I thought and returned/exchanged it for a new one. This time I got it on my guitar and used it a few times then the exact same thing happened. Sent it back. Bummed about it.
