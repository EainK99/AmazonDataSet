Well... I'm sure its not supposed to start smoking...I plugged it into a standard 9v AC adapter (that has worked flawlessly on other items) and it didn't turn on. After about 10 seconds of me looking at the guide, I glanced over and saw smoke curling out of every exit point of the device. Needless to say I quickly unplugged it and prepped it to be shipped back. I'm posting this review as a one star for now, but I've elected to get a replacement shipped and give the product another shot, at which point I will update this. I've read a lot of good things about this particular device, so I'm a bit sad that mine appears to be a lemon. Other than the fact that something's obviously wrong with the electronics on mine, the build quality doesn't seem too bad at all.
