I got this speaker to replace an Eminence Beta speaker in my Polytone Mini  Brute IV, which I use for playing steel guitar. I wanted a 4-ohm speaker, so I would get more volume than I was getting with my 8-ohm speaker.<br /><br />The Eminence sounds really good for my steel guitar. There's none of the somewhat dull &#34;solid-state&#34; sound with it; it sings a lot better than my old speaker, and gives out that distinctive, recognizable steel-guitar sound.<br /><br />I was afraid the Eminence speaker wouldn't fit in the Mini Brute, because of the dimensions as listed. (I thought it might be too deep.) But it fits nicely, with no conflicts. It connects to the amp via banana plugs, rather than spade-type connections.<br /><br />The speaker did come without a manual or instruction sheet of any kind. So I was doubtful as to which connection to connect the amp's red wires to, and which for the blue wires. So I have to deduct a star for that.
