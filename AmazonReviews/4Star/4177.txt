This is the second product from Gator that I get, the first one being a Hard Case Cymbal Carrier, I decided to give them a chance with this Keyboard stand, and I can't complain, easy to set up, has a gear that helps you set its height and it can really get low, just works for me, have it set up right beside me with no adjustments required.<br /><br />The rubber pads don't fit with my Samson Carbon 61 but I just place it at the center and it stays put, no wiggles and no danger at all.
