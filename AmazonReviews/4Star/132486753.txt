4 star item. The overall quality is exactly what you would expect from a 50 dollar guitar. The tuning knobs do tend a slip a bit. This is not an issue as you should tune your guitar every time anyway. As for the sound, superb. Cannot complain about this at all for the price. Compare to related items you will find at wal-mart or toys r us and you will be glad you bought it here. We checked a handful of guitar stores as well and the only thing they had for my daughter in this price range was a few strings. This is a great buy if you are just looking to see if it is something you would enjoy. I would only advise this to those who want a taste of guitars and beginners. Everyone else, you get exactly what you pay for.
