Not as precise or as many options as the &#34;industry standard&#34; Boss TU-2. Also no battery operated option. Works on a pedal train only, but can't be used to &#34;power&#34; a pedal train. This is a one trick pony, and it does that one trick very well. It's perfect for use on a pedestrian/pedalboard. for starters, it's tiny and saves room for more pedals. Second, it is &#34;true bypass&#34;, the Boss equivalent is not. It is easier to see than the TU-2 as the display is more than twice the size.  Both will mute your signal when stepped on.
