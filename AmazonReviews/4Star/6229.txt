CAD's Zoe microphone is small and lightweight for a cardioid condenser microphone, and offers detailed audio reproduction. But when faced with competing models, it may not be the best option in its price range.<br /><br />I’ll compare the Zoe to Blue’s Snowball, another cardioid condenser priced at $99.<br /><br />Sound:<br /><br />The Zoe picks up your voice quite accurately and does a good job reducing background noises you won’t want in your recording, but a slight level of white noise is always noticeably present if you listen for it. Compared to the Snowball, it isn't as rich and fails to pick up the same level of clean, detailed audio. A bit of distortion will also occur if you get too loud too close.<br /><br />Construction and Portability:<br /><br />Both models are encased in plastic, with metal grates. The Zoe is about 1/4 the size of the Snowball and is lightweight and very portable (it almost weighs less than its tripod). The Snowball—although constructed from a higher-quality, more durable plastic—easily weighs four times as much as the Zoe and is big and clunky.<br /><br />Tripods:<br /><br />The Zoe’s tripod folds and opens, and that’s pretty much it. The Snowball’s folds as well, but can also be adjusted vertically and rotates a full 360°. It is, however, significantly heavier than Zoe’s. Both tripods are removable.<br /><br />Ease of use:<br /><br />Both models feature “Plug and Play”, and perform equally well in this regard. I didn’t have to change the settings or install anything to get them to work on my Mac.<br /><br />Other features:<br /><br />The Zoe has a headphone input for live monitoring, a mute button, and can adjust your computer’s output volume. The Snowball has none of these, but it does offer three different modes of input to fit most of your needs. If you plan on recording instruments or multiple people, you'll find the Snowball’s features more useful than the Zoe’s.<br /><br />Overall, the Zoe microphone is a small, solid option if you’re going to be traveling with it, but for podcasting, video production, and desktop work in general, go for the Snowball. It produces a much clearer, richer sound.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend purchasing a pop filter to go with either model, however, as it lets you get close to the mic without having to worry about it picking up your breath (an issue slightly more prevalent in the Zoe).<br /><br />Hope this helps!
