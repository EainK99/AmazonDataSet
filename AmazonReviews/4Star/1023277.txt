From Mountain hillsides with 100 Teens, to Gyms, wedding receptions (small announcements to 200 people playing lawn games) this thing has quickly paid for itself. It's clear, it gets loud enough. the Bass is o.k. not impressive.  The Bluetooth connection for the control app is not dependable... hopefully in a future model it will create it's own wifi hot spot for further distances...
