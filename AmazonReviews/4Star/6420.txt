The passive EV ZLX15 sounds very flat and neutral without any equalization, like a studio monitor but not as accurate since it's woofer, like those of all 15&#34; two way speakers, do not reproduce upper midrange frequencies faithfully (from a high fidelity standpoint). That's why you don't see many 15&#34; based studio monitors for critical listening. Being an EV product though, it does so as well as is possible with current technology. However, for use as a portable full range speaker capable of significant bass output without a subwoofer, such as for DJ applications, it is a good compromise. No doubt the powered version applies some response tailoring in the bass region to give it the punch that is expected while preventing over excursion of the woofer resulting in mechanical damage to it. As such, you must apply similar EQ to get the passive version sounding the same safely, this calls for a 31 band (or so) graphic equalizer. Why go through all the trouble and expense of a rack for the amplifier and equalizer when you can get the powered version you say? One reason is eliminating long power and signal cords, another is reliability and the ability to swap amplifiers if need be, also, without the internal electronics acting as a governor to prevent overdriving the speaker under any conditions, you get a  more open and dynamic sound, and don't forget they cost less. Myself, I use both powered and passive speakers depending on the application and output required. In closing, I have two gripes about the ZLX series that prevent me from giving them 5 stars, one is the thinness of the front lip of the plastic cabinet above and below the grille, the other is the lack of a second side handle. Those were not deal breakers for me though because having the EV sound and reliability at such a reasonable cost is much more important.
