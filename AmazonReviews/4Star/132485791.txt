Firstly, let me say that I decided to try Obligatos because I read many times that they have a very &#34;dark&#34; sound. Now this can be an ambiguous term and may have a meaning for me that is not intended, but I was looking for a gritty, deep, almost viola quality sound.<br /><br />They took about a week and a half to break in and get their &#34;true&#34; sound. They have a good quality, warm sound but lack that &#34;dark&#34; quality I was seeking. I had been using Evah Pirazzis and almost think they had more the quality I have been wanting but went with a new model anyway.<br /><br />While they are a great quality sound, don't expect too much if you are like me and looking for that dark, gut string sound. I think next time I'll actually go with a true gut core.<br /><br />I won't buy these again, but will enjoy them while I have them.
