I was looking for a wireless lapel microphone for a project that I'm filming.  All I needed was a short range system.  These fit the bill and worked just fine.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was not a balanced microphone, but that hasn't been an issue so far.  Balanced microphones have a three wire connection instead of two, the third wire helps eliminate electromagnetic interference giving a cleaner sound. Knowing that it wasn't balanced might have swayed me from buying it but as long as I stay away from electric motors, I've been happy with the system.
