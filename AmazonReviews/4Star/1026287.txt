The HPAEC940 WILL fit the ATH-M50x,  although not super snug like the original Leatherette pads,  that seem to require quite a bit of effort to remove.  These velour pads will come off a little easier,  but won't fall off unless you deliberately try to remove them.  It's a fair trade-off considering the leatherette pads don't breathe well,  and leave your ears feeling hot and stuffy.  I don't notice much negative effects on the superb sound quality of the ATH-M50x.
