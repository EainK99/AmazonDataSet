The only bad thing I can say about this truss is that it does bow in the middle a little. This could be fixed by the center support piece being a little longer, but that is a minor gripe. In the dark, no can notice the truss sinks about an inch or two from the sides. It holds lots of lights, is quite sturdy, and really looks cool! First assembly is a little time consuming, but I learned to leave the brackets attached to the stand and pull the truss apart. Easy enough. The entire stand is light, especially considering how much it holds. A word to the wise: I would suggest going to the American DJ website and ordering the bag of extra brackets. They are plastic and could break. We all have extra cables, hanging brackets, etc. and having extra stand brackets is a good idea.<br /><br />All in all, it is a good stand. FWIW, I don't use the two bars that attach at the end. Those I use on speaker stands to hold extra lights at the other side of the venue for more complete coverage. Practice and enjoy!
