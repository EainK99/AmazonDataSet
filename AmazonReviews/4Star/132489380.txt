I liked the fact that this USB midi cable does work. You connect it to your Midi keyboard and the USB into your computer.<br />IMPORTANT: this cable does not come with any software so can''t just start playing right on the spot by connecting the cables. you need to buy or download a midi software like Synthesia or some other midi software. Then I didn't really like that you have to use the computer speakers or laptop speakers. But the cable work so thats good
