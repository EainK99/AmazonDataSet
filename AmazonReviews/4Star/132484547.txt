I purchased a Tycoon Percussion 12.5\\" Key-Tuned Ashiko and needed a bag for it. After considerable research, and somewhat fearful of the negative reviews here regarding size and quality, I made the plunge and ordered this bag, which is actually a Dancing Drum Signature Series Djembe bag. It fits the Ashiko perfectly.<br /><br />First I'll address the size. The Ashiko is 25\\" tall and conical, with a base the same size as a 13\\" djembe. With the rim it has a diameter of 13.5\\", and the key-tuning lugs stick out a little beyond this. There is plenty of room between the ashiko and the bag, and I can easily slip my hands into the bag and around the drum. This led me to believe that I could fit a 13\\" x 25\\" djembe into the bag as well, but I was wrong. The tuning ropes actually add more width to the diameter than the key-tuning hardware, and despite the two drums being the same height, I can't close the zipper over the djembe, while it closes easily over the ashiko. I presume the Tycoon Percussion 13\\" Dancing Drum Djembe fits fine, but I wouldn't recommend this for most 13\\" djembes.<br /><br />Second is the quality. I couldn't be happier with the material. It really is a nice heavy-duty nylon, and the top zipper seems nice as well. The front pocket easily fits a guiro, ganza, claves, and egg shakers. There is a nice, strong handle on the back between the two carrying straps that I normally use to lug it around. The straps for putting it on your back are not very substantial, however, and if there is a problem with this bag it is probably going to be with the attachment of the straps and handle to the bag. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 primarily for the comfort and feared breakage of the back straps, which aren't important to me.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a bag for carrying your djembe or ashiko a few times a week to a lesson or drum circle, and if you don't really need the back straps to be comfortable or all that heavy duty, this is a great bag that I would highlyrecommend.
