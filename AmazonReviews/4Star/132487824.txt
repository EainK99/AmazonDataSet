Looks pretty real, true to size...sounds great and is priced great for the item.  Shipping is a bit high I think (hence 4/5 *), but where else can you find such an talked about gadget that no one can put down!  You also get a catalog w/handwritten note and of lots of other items they sell which I didn't know..other shakers, Daisy Rock guitars, and lots more.  Seems like a company to support. Was shipped on time and in perfect condition.  Hoping to give to one of my favorite artists Bob Schneider!
