I bought these headphones because of their price. But more importantly, because their specifications said they accept 100mW of power at 32 ohms and that specification exactly matches the output of the FiiO E06 headphone amplifier. So I can use my Sony Handycam to drive the FiiO E06 headphone amplifier which then drive these Technical Pro HPB820 headphones. With the FiiO E06 amplifier and the Technical Pro HPB820's I can monitor the sound I am recording with my Sony HandyCam.<br />Since the sound is at least 50% of any video, then it's best to monitor the sound being recorded so adjustments can be made while recording. That way, with good sound and a good picture, your video has a better chance of succeeding. If you mount a good shotgun microphone to the top of your camcorder your video can approach professional quality.<br />The HPB820's weigh only 9 pounces and the ear cushions block out external sound well enough to accurately monitor the sound being recorded on your video.
