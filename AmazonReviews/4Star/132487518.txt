Well worth the money. It was in excellent condition, and works beautifully. I have always loved the sound of a good amp, and Star Caster is a great product. My guitar sounds gorgeous coming from it's speakers, and makes it so much easier to practice with it. lol. It has all the basic knobs for adjusting the sound, which gives it good range for a begginer guitarist to play with, while still being easy to use.
