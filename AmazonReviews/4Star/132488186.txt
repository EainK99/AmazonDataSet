I use these strings exclusively just because of the tapered end to keep a low playing action.  I prefer the sound, and cost, of Ernie Balls but require the taper.  I can use these strings for about three months (max) before I need to replace them.  The taper is the only reason I purchase them.  I may shim my neck to accommodate the strings I like.  IDK.  I don't want to be with out my main bass.
