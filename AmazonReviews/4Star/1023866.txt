I like the headphones. I actually use them in the opposite ears by hooking them over the top of my ear and then into the ear canal. This works very well for me. They fit flat in my ear and I can wear them with my motorcycle helmet. I have a little problem with the play/pause button. sometimes it does not respond. All things considered, I'm very happy with them.
