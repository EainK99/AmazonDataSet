The metronome seems to work well.  It was actually shipped from Shanghai, China, and I never would have bought it if I had known it would take so long to get here.  &#34;I'm going to get you on a slow boat to China,&#34; could well describe the length of time it took to get here.  However, if a person isn't in a hurry, it appears to be a functional instrument for most purposes.
