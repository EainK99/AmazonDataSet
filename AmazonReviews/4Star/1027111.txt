Very bright, fun color change patterns. Would be nice if the speed and color change options were more versatile. The sticky back doesn't work at all, so we've had to tape them to the wall with clear tape. But otherwise they've worked pretty well for our needs. We just use them to give our room some color, and they line the stairs in our apartment. Fun!
