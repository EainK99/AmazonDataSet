Rode is makes an entire line of microphones, all good quality and priced less than the competition.  This shotgun mic. mounts directly onto the camera.  You do need to know what 80db means (use this to filter low frequency noises like air conditioning).  The biggest problem is where they put the other eq switches; the battery compartment.  These switches are so small you can hardly adjust them.  Rode needs to change this.  Otherwise, I would recommend this microphone for most home and ammeter uses.  Besides, it looks cool as hell on top of your camera.
