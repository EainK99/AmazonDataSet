Looks great, has a nice texture, and it's quite comfortable to use. Also the design of the strap is not some cheesy, poor quality printing, it actually looks pretty good. The only problem in my opinion is that it's rather short. I'm using it on a Ibanez AEG30E acoustic guitar and it ends up really above my waist line... so it would have been great if it were adjustable to longer length.
