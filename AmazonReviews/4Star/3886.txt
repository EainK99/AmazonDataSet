These headphones sound very good. Amazing, even. They have a nice, long coiled cord. I just expected a better build quality from Sony. They seemed cheap. They were not as comfortable as I had hoped. I already own a pair of Sony on-ear portables with active noise cancellation. These were to be for home use. I give them high marks for sound, but the comfort and quality did not meet my expectations.
