I really like this guitar. My only real complaint is that is wasn't properly set up like the guitar I bought from Sweetwater. I had fret buzz on the sixth string, caused by a slight bow, and saddle too low, both things wer easily dealt with, but I shouldn't have had to do anything but tune it, and play it
