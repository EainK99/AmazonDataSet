First and foremost, I am an audio engineer so I am going to be a bit harsh on this product.  I wouldn't ever use something like this but that isn't the point of the product.  Lets face it, you can't buy a useable mic, useable headphones, and a useable audio interface for this price.  To connect all that up, you probably will spend the price of this product in cables alone.  So right there, you have a bargain.<br /><br />I did not buy this for myself, my wife bought it, as the radio station she was doing internet radio for, recommended it.<br /><br />I felt the headphones were only good to monitor tracking, I would never want to use these for much else than that.  What I mean by that is, they are good to hear yourself and know what you are saying, but you can't really tell if it sounds good, bad, or in between.<br /><br />The mic was Ok, very good if you half the cost of the product (or 1/3 if you include the converters) but was on the dull side.<br /><br />One big issues was the boom.  It seemed to not be sturdy and would hit my wife's face, transmitting the sound as she did her radio show.  We could never get it right.  For this reason she ditched it.<br /><br />That said, for nonprofessional use, this is a perfectly good product.  As said, it is less than the cable I use for my own mic.  I replaced the setup using other low dollar equipment (AT USB mic and the cheapest closed back Sennheiser headphones I could find, both on clearance and paid more than double for similar results.  No issue with the boom with a dedicated mic vs and all and one in the mic had a headphone input and converters.  It sounds better and is a better setup overall, but would have been 3x-4x more if I paid retail and still is far from impressive.  However, this setup just was a bit under what I consider useable, outside of a 100% consumer product.  I may have had too high of expectations because CAD makes decent mics for studio recording, though not at this price point, so I was hoping to get the same (or maybe better) bang for the buck.
