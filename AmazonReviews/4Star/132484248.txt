The only reason I didn't give this a 5 was the hope that I could perhaps attract a little more attention and warn potential buyers of two things:<br /><br />Before buying this, I measured 9&#34; from the end of the wire attached to the earphones to my belt - I 'wear' my iPod clipped to my belt. It clearly was long enough.  I'm 5'7&#34; with a slightly longer than average torso for a man of my height.<br /><br />What I didn't account for, and you should, is that:<br />.  I have to turn my head an extreme angle when crossing some streets.  I found I can only do this by placing the iPod holder towards the middle of my belt<br />.  In cooler weather, I wear a sweater or sweatshirt.  The speaker wire can only go under it, not over.<br /><br />Another, perhaps more obvious caution.  Before buying a new extension cable of any length, make sure it is your current one that has the problem by plugging the actual cable directly into your device.  While it is true that the connectors may have problems over time, it is equally true that the same may happen with the actual speaker wire.  If that is the case, excellent product that this is, doing everything as stated admirably, your listening experience will not be improved.<br /><br />Hope this has been helpful to some.
