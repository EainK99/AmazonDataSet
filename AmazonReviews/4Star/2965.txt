[[VIDEOID:1eeea5638db7b95c8e21f008333878fd]]I was so excited to get this.  I've been looking for a new blue tooth speaker for my girls' room because they are constantly taking my speaker and using it to play their spotify playlists.<br /><br />Love the design.  This is so funky.  The touch of the lamp is easy to use and the speaker sound was amazing.  Connecting it to bluetooth on our phones was easy and painless.  I thought with the price point this was in that it wouldn't have the best sound, and while it doesn't compare to my $200 bluetooth speaker, I was very impressed with the sound and the volume on this lamp.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the little black plastic clamps on the lamp cord break extremely easy.  My 6 year old managed to take this apart when I wasn't home and when I went to snap the top plastic back around the cord and onto the wires, it broke in half without any real force.  I duct taped it back together (because duct tape fixes everything) and it still works just as well.  It just now has some pretty duct tape at the top holding the lamp in place.<br /><br />Even with that little piece breaking, I am planning on buying another to put in my boys' room so they can have music at night to listen to also and a little lamp that they can turn on.<br /><br />Pardon that what is coming from the speaker is a commercial.  I didn't want to get in trouble for copyright infringement by using a song. That would be my luck.<br /><br />I received this lamp at a discounted price for my honest review.
