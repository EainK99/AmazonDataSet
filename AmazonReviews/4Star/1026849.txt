The first one came damaged in an undamaged box, and the second badly needed setup.<br />I recommend rotating the pickups so the short teeth are below the low E (original Bass VIs were designed this way), and lowering them considerably, otherwise the magnets will add dissonant overtones as you play up the neck.<br />Once that's done, though, it's a great and novel instrument. Very glad I purchased it.
