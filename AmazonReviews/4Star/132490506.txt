my review therefore is coming at it from a standpoint of occasional use.  if you're like me and make hip hop beats, this is handy to have on hand for when you need something basic for scratching.  i basically throw it on cut mode, and start transforming, chirping and occasionally crabbing away.  i'm not sure something in this price range will hold up over time to hard turntablism, but if you just need to throw some cuts on a track every now and then, this will function well.
