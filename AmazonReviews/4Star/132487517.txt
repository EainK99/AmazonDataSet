This stand was actually better than I was expecting. It works great for holding my guitar. The frame itself is made from good-quality metal, and the feet and back are angled well to hold the weight without tipping, sitting rather firmly. The neck cradle is cushioned with foam, as well as the prongs that hold the body of the guitar at the bottom. the neck cradle also has a rubber peice that you can hook across to help hold the guitar inside, in case it is bumped by someone walking by. the other aspect that I like is that the prongs at the bottom actually swivle a bit, to help adjust for different body styles. So it would be a decent stand for multiple body types, not just the basic ones. I can see this stand staying with me for a long time, and was well worth what I paid for it.
