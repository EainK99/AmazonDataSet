4/5 Stars:<br /><br />Pros: It's a really neat product, that is fun to mess with for hours and lots of really great videos online. the launchpad feels good to touch and though it's all plastic it doesn't feel like it's a cheap piece of crap that will break anytime soon.<br /><br />Cons: This is not a toy that lights up and plays music, this requires a moderate amount of skill and time to learn how to operate the Ableton software. Luckily there is a copious amounts of tutorials and material to show you techniques but this requires that you are actually invested in this controller.<br /><br />Still learning how to use this as well as the Launchkey and LaunchControl.
