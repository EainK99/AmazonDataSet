Another great addition to our lighting for our band. When it's dark enough the red does show up decently. The green is a bit brighter but not a huge deal breaker for me. Add some smoke and just doubles the effect of this laser as you see lots of beams through the room. Looks awesome on a wall for that added effect. The remote works well. Only thing is you can't adjust the speed of the gobo. You'll have to set it when set the laser up. Also this does not cover a large area compared to other lasers unless you have it set up far away from the wall.
