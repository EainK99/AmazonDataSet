My husband bought this to try to play after arthritis in his thumb stopped his guitar playing. Not expecting much in the way of quality, it sounds pretty good. Original strings are hard on the fingers, but with Aquila strings, much more playable. Color is odd, can't see the grain in the wood. Neck is straight. Frets are fairly good. The tuning keys are not great, but work. Can't beat the price for an intro instrument.<br /><br /> JMP says:<br />After 3 months, the Rogue has held up well. Built like a tank. It stays tuned just fine. It is a good start to ukulele if you are on a budget/beginner. The Lanakai baritone we have is much nicer in terms of sound, but this is ok. Strings do make a difference, get the Aquila 21u. We lowered the action on the Rogue too. If you aren't sure how to do this, maybe not the best uke to start with, but what the heck, for $40 go online and see how to do it. It is not rocket science if you're handy at all.<br />We'll put GCEA strings on the Rogue now and keep it around.
