It holds the pedal like it is almost permanent! That is why it is good for traveling, as you know airlines typically do not handle things with care. So it is an assurance that your pedals would always be in place.<br /><br />This is not for pedal junkies who want to move their pedals around often as it is really really difficult to remove the pedals once it is in place.<br /><br />And those complaining the adhesive is no good, it should just be place on a flat and clean surface. Do not stick it on any rubber foot of any pedals as rubber is not stable, it is not an adhesive problem. Although I hope the adhesive would be stronger than the velcro.<br /><br />Having said all that, I gave it 4 stars as it serves my purpose. I love this product!
