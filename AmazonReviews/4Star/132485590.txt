Replaced a generic(but descent) sounding bridge humbucker in A Yamaha RGX with the Air Zone and it became a different instrument immediately. I like using it for both vintage and modern tones. Depending on the desired effect, you can get most tones needed by just adjusting the volume or tone controls. It's very versatile with a clear full tone. It almost seems like a mild or medium power active pickup and seems to have both more highs and more solid bass than most other pickups.<br /> Be warned...If you play sloppy or slide your fingers on the strings it will be heard through the amp. It makes slip-ups and mistakes or bad technique obvious. On the other hand, If you are a little more advanced or have a clean playing technique It sounds awesome! I'm sure most players will adapt and become smoother players because of the sensitivity of this pickup to every movement of the fingers and or strings.
