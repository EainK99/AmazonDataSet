So. I'm in a band and I found myself in need of new gear. It's been a while, and because it's always been a hobby, and never a profession, I easily was able to justify the price point.<br />I had always wanted an SG but never really got around to it. So I did my due diligence, and researched the hell out of it. Seemed like a solid deal.<br />I went to Guitar Center to get it, and I'll never shop at one again. Just a dismal experience.<br />However, the guitar is pretty damn cool. First, the cons.<br />The neck is glued on. Pretty visible but a comfortable neck nonetheless. Satin finish gives it a silky feel.<br /><br />The action was set stupid high out of the box. An easy fix but the unit had a sticker that proclaimed it had been set up and strung in the USA. A quarter inch of action at the 24 th fret is nothing to brag about.<br /><br />The strings are of low quality but playable. Hey, for the price point you should be glad it's strung at all.<br /><br />She's a neck diver. Get a padded strap. I don't care what anyone else says- the headstock will gravitate towards the floor.<br /><br />That's pretty much it for the negative. Now the positive.<br /><br />The finish is lovely. A deep cherry mahogany. No burst effect but I don't like flashy. It's a personal preference. The guitar has a soft silky feel instead of a slick cold one. I dig it.<br /><br />The trapezoidal inlays on the fretboard are really nice.<br /><br />The pickups are true humbuckers and do the job.<br /><br />All four knobs are properly functional and the pickup selector switch is good.<br /><br />Grover tuners are a nice quality touch.<br /><br />Double cutaway a nice design. Looks badass and serves a purpose.<br /><br />I run mine through a Zoom G9.2tt processor and then through my Mac. I use it to record and practice and I love it. Good tone and tonal control. Responds especially well to overdrive patches.<br /><br />One last thing. I'm a big guy, 6'6&#34; and I have large hands. The neck on thisguitar may not be for everybody, but I find it extremely comfortable.<br /><br />Four stars only because the setup was kinda weak. But after a little tweaking- a pretty mean inexpensive guitar. If you have to go to a storefront tho- I'd avoid Guitar Center and seek out a Sam Ash
