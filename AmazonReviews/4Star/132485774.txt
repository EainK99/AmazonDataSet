And best sounding (at this price point) cans I've ever used. They will win 0 points for style, and use lots of cheap materials compared to other headphones. Also for long sessions they will probably get a lil uncomfortable. But that being said they rock. There bass is loud. The mid and highs are distinctive and clear, and very warm for phones at this price. I had never heard of tacam but theyve impressed meet. It uses the small 3.5 mm jack. It is 90% plastic and pleather, but man theyre good. They are on par with headphones you can pay 3xs as much assuming you can do with out the frills. If you have exactly this much to spend, I dont think you will find better headphones.
