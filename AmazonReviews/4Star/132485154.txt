I play Bass so some guitar stands  do not go up quite high enough or are not sturdy enough for my needs.  This stand extends up to almost the middle of the neck on my guitar and makes it very very sturdy.  Highly recommend for on stage where getting bumped in the dark or by fellow members can be a problem.
