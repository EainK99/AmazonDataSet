I really, really love the way this strap looks. It's very well made and worth purchase, I'm sure it will last me the rest of my life. It is pretty stiff, and I will guess that because it's so beefy. It'll take awhile to break in. That's okay with me.<br /><br />If you are looking for a SOFT guitar strap, this is not it.
