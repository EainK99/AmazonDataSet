Yes, I think the CX2310 is great (using it on a home audio system) except there is no bypass switch that will send the full frequency range through all the outputs.  There are a lot of reasons why someone would want that feature especially since...<br /><br />... here comes my other nit picky complaint ...<br /><br />they decided to put some of the switches on the back.<br /><br />I have the crossover in a rack (with screws and everything) and making changes when switches are on the back where it's dark and you can't see is a major pain!<br /><br />Despite my complaints, I think this is a top notch crossover at bargain basement prices and I would not hesitate to recommend it.
