I am actually a big fan of Gretsch Guitars and I already owned a couple of them. I ended up returning this particular guitar, because it had an annoying buzzing noise coming from under the pick guard. This is in no way a negative reflection on this particular model, as I love my Gretsch G100 acoustic. I ended up getting a Godin 5th Ave Kingpin, which $50.00 cheaper and I have been very happy with it.
