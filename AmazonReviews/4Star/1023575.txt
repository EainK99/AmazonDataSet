Pros: Durrability, Battery Life, sound, easy pairing.<br />Cons Bluetooth 4.0 and and a 4G LTE phone.<br /><br />These headphones are great they take no effort to pair with my phone and a number of other devices, they have excellent sound quality, and fit well and securely.<br /><br />The downside... they are Bluetooth 4.0 which operates in the same band as 4G LTE phones so short of disabling LTE on my phone or never touching anything that might use data while I'm listening to the headphones I have to endure a bit of a chatter in the sound when not connected to WiFi<br /><br />These issues are fixed in Bluetooth 4.1
