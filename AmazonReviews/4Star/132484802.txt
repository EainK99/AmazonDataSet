Was definitely skeptical of these for the price. Had an issue with one speaker initially, turned out to be a bad solder on the crossover which I elected to fix myself. When I called their customer support they were extremely helpful though. After that slight hiccup they have functioned flawlessly and have plenty of power to jam the house at party's. Good bass and clear vocals for karaoke nights.
