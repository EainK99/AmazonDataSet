I'm an R&R/R&B singer in a cover band. This mike really does balance out the highs and lows in my voice, (Soprano with a wide passagio to Alto range) but I find I have to turn up the volume a tad. Andt you have to be careful when hand holding the mike and moving because being a cartoid  it picks up sound around you. around order the wind cover for outdoor and a pop shield for recordings.
