Best bang for buck for sure. Very comfortable, only start hurting after a very long time, and the quality surprised me for 25USD headphones. They were very good for music and also for gaming (good surround), althougn the cable may be too long for most and therefore they probably will have to use the cable winder that can be unpractical.<br />The only real problem I had with these headphones is that they gave up in little more than a year, much earlier than I had expected.<br /><br />If you're looking for an excellent pair of entry level headphones, these are for you.
