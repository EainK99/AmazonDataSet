Idk, I had high hopes for this EZX along with Made of Metal, but anyone would be crazy not to select Metal Machine EZX over these two...Metal Machine simply sounds better. Back to Metal! EZX now...the cymbals, esp the hihats lackluster... Instead of brand names like Ludwig...it displays funny names... Like Big crack snare or something... After watching the amazing trailer video for this product..I am a little disappointed.. I first owned Metal Machine...but I got greedy and figured if MM was great.. Then M! Would be over the top incredible... To me MM just sounds better..sets in the mix better..and sounds more realistic. Good luck people.
