After a LOT of use, this thing is holding together. The sound quality is great and I love the features. I've rolled it around for maybe 5-10 miles before the handle broke, which is disappointing, and some of the jacks are coming lose, making my cables slip out. But overall I am really glad I bought this, as I do 1-man performances on ukulele on guitar and it's perfect for small venues.
