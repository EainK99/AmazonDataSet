[[VIDEOID:mo3RWP2BNQVYC44]]The TASCAM TH-2000 Headphones are a fairly inexpensive and decent sounding set of closed headphones.<br /><br />Using a set of cheap iPhone earbuds and my pair of Sennheiser HD-280 headphones, I compared a variety of music styles, from hard rock to audio books, with the TASCAM headphones. The TASCAM headphones sounded much better than the earbuds, but not quite as good as the Sennheisers. The TASCAMs have a heavier bass, while the mid and high frequencies are not as strong. This was fine for rock music, but the narrator's voice in the audio books sounded artificial and oddly placed in the aural space. Also, I found the TASCAMs to be a little uncomfortable after extended wear, and I suspect they will feel oversized for some people.<br /><br />In the video I do an unboxing and demonstrate some of the features of the headphones.<br /><br />So in summary, these TASCAM TH-2000 Headphones are a decent choice if you are looking for a step-up in quality from your cheap earbuds, or if you want a second set of headphones to wear outdoors or on travel so you don't risk losing or damaging your high quality headphones that you keep at home.
