As many others have said, this is a very nice entry-level cajon. Barring defect or shipping damage, you should get a great instrument out of the box. Of course, like mine it will likely need tuning.<br /><br />I've tuned my cajon a couple times but will continue to play with it. I had an unusual buzzing sound that resolved when I tightened the bolts underneath the front. YouTube has many good videos on how to tune it- don't be afraid to experiment.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying learning some basic technique and seeing what works for me, as short person with small hands. After tuning and learning just a little bit from reading/watching YouTube lessons, I'm already having a blast.<br /><br />My review would be 5 stars I'd Meinl included basic instructions. It comes with a nice fat catalog- but nothing else.
