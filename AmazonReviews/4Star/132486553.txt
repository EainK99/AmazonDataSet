i bought this preamp to use with my new Sherbourne power amp for one month until i can buy the Emotiva USP-1 preamp.  it works ok, nothing special.  the unit i received is different from the pictures on Amazon.  it is the model SEA-2500X. the main differences are that it has a input selector knob, instead of push buttons, and the colored panels around the front controls are much more subdued in color (dark burgandy instead of purple & very dark blue instead of the bright blue in the pics). i prefer the knob and darker colors that came on my unit. the unit looks much better.  the volume knob has indents, but you can set the volume between the indents so not a problem.  the only thing i didn't like about it is the one-piece front panel with non-removable rack mounts.  it won't fit in my stereo cabinet, i had to put it on top of the cabinet; oh well, i can live with the rack mounts for another two weeks. it would have been a perfect cheapie if it had removable rack mounts.  i haven't seen ANY other preamps for any where near 65 dollars. i'll keep it for a small computer room system.  well worth the price.
