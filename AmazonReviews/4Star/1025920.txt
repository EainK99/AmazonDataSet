For the money, these microphones are solid performers.  I have only had one challenge with them, and was able to correct that one.  Select-able 16 channels in cases of intereference.  Sound quality may not be a Shure, but it is plenty clear enough where I'm not thinking about whether they sound like cheap microphones or not.  The price for a pair of UHF also can't be beat.<br /><br />I did not run these on the included 1000 mAh batteries, because I had concerns about how long they would last during live use, so I can't speak on the battery life with those.  I bought a pack of Panasonic Eneloop batteries  [[ASIN:B00JHKSMJU Panasonic Advanced Individual Cell Battery Charger with eneloop AA New 2100 Cycle Rechargeable Batteries, 4 Pack, White]] and charged and inserted those instead.  I'm still not 100% certain about the charging operation on this model.  The indicators show charging with both mics when the device is powered off (but plugged in), but will only show charging one at a time if it is powered ON.  However, I had this unit on with both mics docked for a while and the indicators did start blinking slowly, so it might actually be charging while on and both mics or it might not.  Honestly, I can't be sure.<br /><br />Another caveat... the &#34;volume&#34; controls on the front ONLY work when the device is attached via the ¼&#34; (Quarter Inch) unbalanced connector.  I like that I can run two XLR's into an external mixer and control individual channels, but it should be known that when using XLR, the volume controls become completely irrelevant.  I actually had a problem where if my performers held the microphone up to their lips, (i don't know why they do that), the signal coming from the transmitter would clip on the mixer, even with the gains at zero on the mixer.  (too hot signal).  I DID however find that there is a gain screw inside the transmitter body near the batteries.  I was able to adjust it down a pinch, so no more clipping.<br /><br />In all, very happy with what I got for the money.happy with what I got for the money.
