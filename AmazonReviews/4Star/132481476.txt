Bought this as &#34;slightly used&#34; but -- buying from a warehouse that meant &#34;returned opened&#34; to us.  My son really likes the extra storage space which fits his Kuni chinrest, the outside pocket for his music, and the detachable backpack straps -- none of which were available in the case that we &#34;inherited&#34; with the violin.
