Stereo is nicely made, finished nicely. Turn on & boot up takes a few seconds - processor is slow compared to most. Remote is finicky - must be aimed exactly right or it does not work - also you can't be to far away from the unit.  Sound quality is great and it has plenty of power to push inside speakers and a second set of outside speakers.  Over all I'm pleased, but there is room for a product upgrade in the future.
