When I ordered my Dean Soltero Standard I ended up with a Dean Soltero Standard Special. Keep in mind most people do NOT know the difference. Keep in mind both are made in Korea with the exceptions of the pickups. If it has the split coil pick up then it's the actual Standard, if If it comes with DMT pick ups (Made in USA), trust me you will know the difference because it has a sticker right on the coils, it is in fact a Standard Special. One thing you need to know is the DMT pickups are NOT split coil. One is a Baker Act pickup and one is Nostalgia pickup. If you search Baker Act you will be able to get an audio clip that will give you a sample sound but the sample sound is a little cleaner than what is actually on the guitar. Much heavier sound than the standard pickups. Perfect for rock and metal. Some say Jazz but it depends on which pickup you are using. It has a 3 way switch that allows you to play the Baker Act PU alone, Both PU's and finally the Nostalgia PU alone. These were short ran and released particularly to Germany from what I was told. On mine it has Warwick strap ends, which makes it virtually flawless for making sure the  strap stays on unless you have a crap strap. The tuners are Grover non-locking tuners which are perfect since the tuners keep the strings in tune so I can see why Mr. Zelinsky likes them.Overall though I can't say it's a bad make. I was disappointed when it didn't have the split coils because they ran cleaner but since this is somewhat of a rare version I'm not complaining. Now if you want the same style but a little bit better craftsmanship check out deanzelinsky.com where you can find Mr. Zelinsky's Private Label. Mr. Zelinsky started looking for a CNC back around 2010 and now he is where he started when he was 19 back to building guitars the way it was done when Kansas first started except this time he's added a little more of a personal touch.
