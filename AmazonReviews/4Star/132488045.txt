I've owned this for about six months and find it practical and secure. The rubber corners keep my iPad secure in the holder, albeit, the weight of the iPad means it can be a little top-heavy and prone to toppling over if not positioned correctly and balanced over the tripod-style legs (or putting sandbags or weights on the tripod legs for my occasional garage concert gigs).  I'm no engineer, but maybe four legs might keep the toppling issue from making my list of concerns/recommended improvements. Otherwise, glad stood up and bought it.
