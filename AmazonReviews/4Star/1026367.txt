I wasn't expecting the cord to be coiled..  So if my audio system is five feet from my chair the headphone cord has to be stretched leaving a constant pull  on my head.  Maybe the company has a replacement cord.I will ask them and let you know.<br /><br />  The other issue is the tightness to the ears. The phones are always putting pressure on my ears.  Gets very uncomfortable after wearing for awhile.  I couldn't find any adjustment to relief the pressure. or tightness.  Anybody with a narrow head they will fit fine.<br /><br />The cups fit the ear very well, except for the pressure, They sound great and seem very tough..<br /><br />I emailed them about the cord and in there own words... &#34;There is NO way for you to get your HD280pro to have a straight cable.&#34;  So if your thinking about this headphone, think twice.. headband is very tight and the coiled cord is always in a tight pull.<br /><br />Added: After putting pressure on the tech, he did say the cord can be replaced but with difficulty.. I attached an image of the area in question.
