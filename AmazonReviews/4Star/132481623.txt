It's decent for the price but the cork between the lower and upper joint is extremely tight. This makes it hard to assemble and disassemble the instrument without risking damage to the keys since there is really no good place to get a strong grip on it. Use a lot of cork grease and handle it very carefully the first few times you put it together.
