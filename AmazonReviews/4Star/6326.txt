I am a rover (no classroom to call my own) Spanish teacher, and I bring this to my classes. I opted for plastic (I have a cordoba concert at home) for school because it would be more resilient and go out of tune less.<br /><br />I'm pleased with this uke. It goes out of tune slightly, but uniformly, so my chords still sound ok.
