Beautiful sticks. But, I own an earlier pair of Regal Tip hickory 5As (the older green label model) and I had hoped that the new pair would be like those. The older pair were slightly shorter and much lighter in weight, which I happen to like more. I ordered these thinking that these would be pretty similar. The new pair were noticeably heavier and longer than the older 5A model. The tip of the stick was shaped slightly different as well. For some drummers, these changes may be a good thing. But I had fallen in love with the older RT 5A model. If I had not owned an earlier pair and just bought these for a new pair of 5A sticks without my prior expectation, I would still be very pleased. I love the finish and they were perfectly straight. My only disappointment was the change in length and weight, which I wasn't expecting.
