I primarily bought this to use with my iPad when I'm traveling to use with a variety of iOS synths including Novation's Launchkey and Launchpad apps. I'll use it with my Macbook Pro as well, but as a secondary controller.<br /><br />It works very well controlling the Launchkey app, but is a bit laggy if there are too many other apps running. I have an iPAD 3, so I'm a bit disappointed it's having this issue but is probably the applications themselves and not the keyboard. The Launchkey can also interact with the Launchpad app, but it's much less useful than using the dedicated Launchpad controller (duh :) )<br /><br />The keys are surprisingly good for a keyboard in this price range. They're not quite as good as my SL MKII 61, but far better than my Alesis Q25 and lightyears ahead of my antique M-Audio Oxygens. I'm able to do hammond-style glisses without it feeling like the keys are going to fall off, which is kind of the acid test of a keyboard IMHO. Since I usually just stick with synth and organ stuff, I didn't notice any issues with keyboard velocity.<br /><br />Before I take this unit travelingI need to beef up the padding in the case so the somewhat fragile feeling knobs don't get broken off while inside the case.
