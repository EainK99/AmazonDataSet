I made this purchase to send to my grandson, and per my daughter who opened the box, the color wasn't as red as pictured.  She said, &#34;It's more of a shade of maroon than a cherry red,&#34; but she thought it was a nicer shade for a boy.  I took other reviewers comments to heart (about the mouthpiece) and purchased a Yamaha mouthpiece and it sounds great, is easier for him to blow and even his band instructor said he was impressed.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend the sax with the Yamaha mouthpiece... only reason for 4 stars, since original mouthpiece was difficult to blow.
