I do believe that the power and watts below is incorrect. I don't think you are supposed to give them more than 250-300 at 8 ohms. Go to the Mackie site and look it up. I bought them and gave them hell for a short period of time, but as I said go to the site. There is a lot of dancing around the words program, watts, power and peak.
