Light, pretty, put together well. Trumpet fits perfectly. Front pocket is good for valve oil, slide grease, and even my straight mute. Velvety interior keeps my trumpet clean and fingerprint-free. Shoulder strap is useful, flat on base so the case can stand up. fits right under your chair in rehearsal. buy.
