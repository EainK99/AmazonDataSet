Works good so far. The fan is a question mark. Not because its cheep or loud but because is blowing air the wrong way. It pulls unfiltered air into the rear over the heat sinks then through the filter on the front. So what's the point of the filter if dust is still getting into the unit. I'd say just flip the fan and allow it to pull from the front and exhaust out the back. I haven't had any problems with clipping yet so long as the signal going into it is clean. I've got two seismic audio dual 10&#34; mains on one channel at 2 ohm and 4 jbl 15&#34; subs at 2 ohm on the other. It's loud, clear and it worked great at my wedding for 6+ he's at high volume. Clipping wasn't an issue
