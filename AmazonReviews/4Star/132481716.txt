It goes louder and deeper than you'd ever think from looking at it. Yes, it doesn't really do much below 80Hz, but 95% of the time this is all the amp you need for just about any show. The graphic is good, the speaker modeling control (vintage rolloff) is excellent. I've tried the power amp with other speakers and it comfortably drives 4 ohms to high volumes.<br /><br />The only negative I can find is that the DI out has a 20dB attenuator switch, which does not take it all the way down to mic level, so some less competent sound engineers will not like it (an additional 20dB inline attenuator fixes this).<br /><br />It's awesome and you want one.<br /><br />[update] Docked one point for reliability. Yes, they stopped making them a few years ago, but mine is now having the \\"slow startup\\" issue that is a precuror to the \\"won't turn on\\" problem. Ibanez official support tells me that the parts to fix this problem simply are not available. So that's that, then. It's great gear, but disposable and planned obsolescence makes it less cool.
