I purchased this for a Yamaha EMX-512 powered mixer--the same model, I believe, that is shown in the product photos.  The case does not line up particularly well with the handle, so there is no a good way to carry it, and there is no handle or shoulder strap on the case itself.  But the Yamaha fits inside beautifully, and this is a bargain for near custom sized protection for a device that is designed to be moved from location to location.
