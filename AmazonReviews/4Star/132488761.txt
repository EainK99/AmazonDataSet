I bought four of these to hang a banjo, a guitar and two ukes.  It worked great for all of them.  It holds sturdy and it's super easy to get instruments in and out.  The adjustable arms are key.  The arms are also padded, which is nice since you don't have to worry about any scratching.<br /><br />The only negative is that they really aren't anything pretty to look at.  It would be nice if they had a faux wood veneer on the wall mount or something - there are a lot better looking hooks out there.  However, the price was good for what I got.
