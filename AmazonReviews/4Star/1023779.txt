This is my daughter's go to oboe reed.  She is a newer player in middle school, so she's not a professional.  For her needs as a student, these are great, and of all she's tried so far, they are her favorite.  I order these quite often, and they are very well packaged in their own hard plastic case, rating on a small piece of foam.
