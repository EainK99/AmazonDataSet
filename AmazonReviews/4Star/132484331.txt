This guitar definitely gives the player the look and feel of a much more expensive instrument. I would love to have the U.S. made version but since I'm not a pro it will be  while before I have that kind of cash.  This instrument has so far worked flawlessly with none of the issues noted from other reviewers.  The only think I noticed is that I had a tendency to make contact with the triple pickups when I picked on the strings a little too deeply.  I've received several comments from others on the style, beauty and finish.  I would definitely recommend buying it.  If you can find one for less the $500 it is a definite buy.
