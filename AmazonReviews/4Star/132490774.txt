The functions in this machine is great. There are many songs that are recent. However, the songs that are included do not meet up to the original songs. That is my only complaint but so far It's working okay due to the background music not being similar to the original.<br /><br />UPDATE----<br />Okay, so the songs didnt sound like the originals because the melody was set to 6. So, if you do not want the music to sound really cheesy and like elevator music, I recommend that you turn the Melody down to 0, thats what I did and the music sounds so much better.
