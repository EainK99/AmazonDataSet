I bought 4 of these for my studio about 5 years ago. The left side of one of them went out about a year into, and i must say i am pretty hard on my stuff so i want surprised when one side stopped working.  But the rest have held up fine!  I still use them today.  The frequency response is good.  When you listen to music with them completely flat (without any EQ)  it sounds pretty good.  They're not the best headphones but they definitely get the job done.
