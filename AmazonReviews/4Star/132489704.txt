I got this stand to replace a folding wire stand my son was using to practice fiddle. This really is a great stand. It's not exactly portable the way that the folding wire stands are, but then again those don't hold up for long. The last one we had made it about a year, and it was the second one in two years we had purchased. This is about twice as expensive as a wire stand.  This can be taken along if you take the base off of the top,  the base folds like a tripod, but the top doesn't fold so you can't throw it in a pouch and sling it over your shoulder. we don't tend to take it out of the house so the portability wasn't that important to me. It is a good, solid, sturdy stand. The top is nice and wide with plenty of room to spread music out, it's adjustable to many different angles and heights. I would definitely purchase this again if I need a second one.
