I bought two of these.  They're quite nifty contraptions and work very well to hold your drink.  The only problem is that I've found sometimes you grab your drink and accidentally nudge the mic stand a bit and the SwirlyGig rattles its way down to the base of the mic stand.  It's not a common occurrence, but when it happens it's a bit annoying.  Looking back, I'd buy some kind of clamping one if I made my purchase again, but it works nicely enough and is easier/faster to install.
