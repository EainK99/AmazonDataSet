This is a great guitar. First, let's start with the aesthetics. When I walked into the music store I was very excited when I saw the profile - it's a very beautiful guitar. I have to admit that I was disappointed when I saw that this was a Johnson Guitar. I was still intrigued, so I picked it up and played it.<br /><br />For starters, the fretwork, fit, and finish of this guitar were great. The chambered mahogany body gives you the right amount of resonance to give this guitar a really full and rich sound when unplugged. I asked if I could plug the guitar into a PA system - the true test. I was impressed with how balanced this guitar sounded. With the EQ set flat, without added reverb or delay, I fell in love with this guitar!<br /><br />The tuner is also unique. The pickup is color coded - it turns red or blue when you're sharp/flat and green when you're on pitch.<br /><br />So... why the 4 stars?<br /><br />1) The neck pocket wasn't perfect. The body of the guitar isn't square to the neck, there's a little gap due to an untrue cut. Most people miss it when they look at the guitar... but it was there on mine. It doesn't affect playability, and when you're playing the guitar, you can't see it.<br /><br />2) The bridge doesn't seem to be a hard wood, when I used my pin puller it seemed to make little dents in the bridge. The holes were a little too big too causing the pins to settle a little too deeply. I ended up swapping the bridge pins with brass bridge pins - problem solved.<br /><br />3) The action was a little high. I pulled the bridge in hopes of finding a few shims so I could remove them and lower the action. I ended up replacing the saddle with a none saddle. As a result, it plays much better.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great sounding/playing guitar. A pleasant surprise coming from Johnson!
