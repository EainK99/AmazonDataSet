This is a really nice case for the money.  Fits my LTD EC-1000 VB Duncan perfectly.  Shipping was fast and free.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the case lock is cheap and doesn't work.  Only a problem if you ever let your guitar out of your sight.  I don't.  I only use the case to transport it from place to place.  Otherwise, it's hanging on my wall from a String Swing (another great product)  Good looking case, and should do the job.
