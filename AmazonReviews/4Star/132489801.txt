I bought this as an Easter present for my 4 year old daughter. I play guitar and fiddle, and my mother plays Uke. My daughter wanted an instrument, and I wanted her to leave my guitars alone, so this seemed like a good choice. I didn't want to get her a toy Ukulele, because I wanted her to be able to actually play it if she had the interest in it. She had specifically wanted a pink instrument, so this fit the bill.<br /><br />The good: It's inexpensive, which was a must for me since I was giving it to a child. It has a better sound than I expected for a painted Ukelele in this price range. It's easy to play, and has a pretty decent tone.  My daughter was able to play a couple of Chords right away, when I showed her how.  Mostly she just likes to walk around strumming open strings and making up songs, but it makes her happy.<br /><br />The not so good: It doesn't hold a tune for long. I was goofing around on it, and I had to re-tune it every 30 minutes or so. I thought maybe it was because it was new and the strings hadn't settled in yet, but months later it still needs to be tuned often. This isn't a big deal to me, because my daughter doesn't really care if it's in tune most of the time. and it's easy enough to tune it up, if she wants to play a real song on it. The little gig bag is really cute, but it offers no protection for the instrument other than keeping dust off of it. If you want to take this along with you I suggest getting a padded bag.<br /><br />The verdict: It exceeded my expectations for tone and volume. Generally painting an acoustic instrument is never a good idea, but this little Uke sounds OK despite having been painted. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who was serious about learning the Ukelele, but for a kid to goof around on, and learn a few chords you can't go wrong for the price.
