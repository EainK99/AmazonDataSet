My niece decided she wanted to play the guitar.  Now this is the niece that every week or so, she would get a new \\"great idea\\".  She was just a teenager, and that is what they are supposed to do.  I did not want to discourage her if that is what her calling is, but didn't want to spend a fortune if she was giving it up in a week.  This was a perfect little gift.  It was not to expensive, and was beautiful.  This is a full size guitar, and sounds wonderful.  And was well worth it, especially since she gave up the guitar less than a month later.
