If you want a very solid feel to wearing your accordion, these are excellent straps. Genuine leather, quite stiff to begin with. The end straps for fastening to the accordion are multiple layers. Time will tell if this design is better than a thick single piece. The original  straps on my 32-pound instrument had softer padding than these new straps, but after using the new straps for a few weeks (about 20 hours of playing), I'm quite used to them and they feel good. The thin back straps riveted to the shoulder straps are useless, however. Difficult to fasten, and not adjustable along the length of the shoulder strap. I cut them off my straps. The buckles on the straps could be more solid (thicker and more rounded) for a better feel, but they are fine for the good price. The two straps are the same length. To get one to be significantly shorter than the other, as I needed it, I doubled up the strap and wrapped it with cord. I am very pleased with the overall excellent quality of these straps, and unless you want a cushy, stretchy feel, they should serve you well.
