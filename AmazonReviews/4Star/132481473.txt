I had my pedals attached to a Laptop bag, so I had to move the top everytime I need to tweak the pedals. I also had aluminum cases for the pedals before, but too big. I decided not to have anything and just connect the pedals every time I play a gig, but it takes too much time. So I decide to go for this one, I wanted a small one, and I realized the Nano is too small. I only use 5 pedals, including the volume and I was able to fit the volume as well there.<br />Only thing I noticed is that there is no much protection to the pedals when you carry that thing, so be careful.
