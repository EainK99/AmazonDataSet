This pick guard arrives just as it appears on Amazon. It is a quality product. The artwork is no decal, it is deeply embedded in the pick guard sheathing, as advertised. No matter how hard you play (and I play with my rhythm hand like a gorilla) there is no way to damage the artwork. The only caveat I will mention is that on my SG (a not-quite-official-but-still-Gibson-label \\"faded\\" SG) I did have some small problems with the screws going back into their original holes in a straight manner. The drilled holes in the pick guard were in the right place, but ever-so-slightly offset the screws. Just the same I got it on and it looks great! I get many positive comments about this WWII pinup pick guard.
