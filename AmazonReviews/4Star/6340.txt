Good illumination, light weight, well-made product.  It makes a perfect AC or USB powered stand light, and can be powered by internal batteries.  Now if it also recharged from AC or USB it would be simply perfect - and that model may be coming.  Meanwhile, a very good light that I expect to give good service for many years.
