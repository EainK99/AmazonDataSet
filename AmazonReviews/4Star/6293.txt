If half stars were available, this would receive 4 1/2. The bench itself is sturdy, comfortable and functional. However, there were two minor issues with the order.<br />First, there was a very delayed estimated ship date but the bench was actually delivered much sooner. This would not oridinarily be a problem, but this is a large package that my wife couldn't move into the house by herself and I was out of town when it was delivered. No tracking was made available.<br />Second, no assembly instructions were included. Fortunately, there are only 4 legs to attach and a tool to match the nut size was provided. But it would be quicker to assemble if there were instructions provided to make sure the legs are attached properly.
