Exactly what it says it is. I am just over 300 lbs and feel comfortable on this throne. The bolt style provides a greater sense of assurance that the seat will not move at all between playing and transportation. The screw-wheel for the seat itself is a little annoying but that seems to be standard on all thrones. There could be a bit more padding but overall this purchase was a good value.
