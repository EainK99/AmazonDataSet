I bought one of these about eight years ago, and still enjoy it. Honestly, I've never put enough time into it to get very good, but it's a lot of fun. Besides the recorder, this is the simplest instrument that one could consider for professional music. It will mix well with most any other instrument, or any style of music. It's loud enough to stand on it's own without amplification.<br /><br />My one negative is that it's all one piece. It would have been nice for the mouthpiece to be separate, and replaceable. I could imagine that over time, one's front teeth could wear through the top of the Pocket Sax. I eliminated that worry by using Runyon Mouthpiece Savers. They are a small self-stick patch that goes on top of mouthpieces to block tooth damage. They are made of a black rubber, or a clear flexible plastic. I use the rubber style they offer for clarinet. It requires minor trimming with scissors to fit well. My Sax doesn't have a single tooth mark, and I don't notice the Saver when playing. My Pocket Sax still looks like brand new. Excellent quality.<br /><br />For reeds, I like the Bari synthetic reed in Soft weight.<br /><br />I've found the included instruction booklet to be easy to understand, and very adequate to learn the Pocket Sax. All you need is patience and practice.
