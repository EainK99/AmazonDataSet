I hung these over my workbench for a bit of extra light. White LEDs would have been just fine, but sometimes it's fun to sand down some wood under disco lights...<br /><br />Minor gripes:<br /><br />1) A few of the LEDs don't match the exact color of the rest of the strip. Maybe a bad connection to one of the red, green, or blue terminals of the individual LED's, except that in my case it is several in a row, in the middle of the strip. Weird, but not a big deal for my purposes.<br /><br />2) The adhesive strip is garbage. Doesn't stick to anything. I used a glue gun, laying a stripe of hot glue, waiting for it to cool a bit, then pressing the LED strip into it. Worked great as a semi-permanent solution.<br /><br />3) You have to point the remote almost directly at the infrared receiver. More so than you are probably used to based on TV remotes, etc. I'm guessing it's just a very low power transmitter, or maybe the receiver is fairly unidirectional.<br /><br />Despite my gripes, I still love these lights, and the seller got them to me impressively quickly. I bought two more strips for my kids' rooms, and they really love being able to choose what color or pattern lights up their room, moment by moment.
