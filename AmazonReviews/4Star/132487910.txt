I bought this guitar on a closeout, I thought I would give it a try for the price. Guitar is light and well balanced. The action was just a little bit higher than I like it but very playable. The stock pickups seem to do the job very well and the neck felt great. As for the finish , I could not find a flaw. The back was perfect and the binding look really good. The cracked mirror front does look better from a distance but it is a real cracked mirror and could not be broken perfectly. The hardware is quality and tuners are grovers. It came with a gigbag and I have yet been able to find a hard case. Overall not a bad guitar , I would not pay over $500 for it. I have had a few cheaper guitars that were much nicer than this but I also am not a washburn fan, just a Kiss fan. This is a cool guitar that I will never play.
