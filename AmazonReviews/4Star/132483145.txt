I had the opportunity to pickup a T-Rex Tonebug Distortion for a great used deal.  I had no idea what to expect, and after doing some research about it on the internet, reviews seemed to be quite mixed.  After getting it home and plugging it in, I was initially disappointed, but gradually came to appreciate its value, with some notable caveats.  Here's some the positives and negatives from my experience with the Tonebug Distortion:<br /><br />PROS:<br />Build Quality - Unlike many \\"budget\\" pedals, T-Rex (out of Denmark) has made a very sturdy and reliable pedal here.  Solid metal casing with good weight to it, and a metal switch that turns on and off with a \\"soft\\" press, as opposed to a \\"click\\" (comparable to the switches on the Vox Satchurator)  The pedal is slightly wider than a BOSS or MXR, but the I/O jacks and power adapter jack (9V or 12V) are all on the top, which reduces the side-to-side width on a pedalboard.  I actually prefer the I/O jacks on the sides, but others may prefer them in this arrangement.  The cables can be a bit of a tight fit, but it feels very durable.  The 9V battery compartment (if you use one) is on the back and is accessible without screwdrivers, which is a plus.<br /><br />High Output/Clarity - One of the immediate things you notice about the Tonebug Distortion, which saves it from being a \\"terrible\\" pedal, is that it offers plenty of output.  Unity gain is easily achieved at 12:00 (or possibly lower).  Tone, and distortion/overdrive in particular, is very subjective, but as long as you have a pedal with enough headroom to match or boost your amp's clean signal, there's the possibility that someone will have a use for the pedal.  I found that the tone had impressive clarity for distorted power chords, and could be an ideal match for combo amps/cabinets with larger speakers that tend to sound \\"muddy\\" with distortion.  This pedal also has quite a bit of output on tap, and operates at high gain quieter than something like a BOSS DS-1.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Lack of bass - Several of the reviews I read criticized the Tonebug Distortion for being \\"too bright\\", but I don't believe that's the case.  The emphasis on this pedal is more in the upper midranges than the highs.  It doesn't sound screech or \\"ice-picky\\", yet at the same time, it lacks the low end that many other distortion pedals offer (and modern guitarists prefer).  If you are looking for a pedal to make your smaller amp sound \\"big\\" - this probably isn't it.  It will get very loud, but won't add the low end mimicking that 4x12 cabinet sound.  The prevalence of upper mids is a mixed bag, because it really increases the perceived volume of the sound and would probably cut through the mix in a live setting, yet it leaves you wanting more on the low end.  You can roll back some of the brightness with the tone knob, but it won't add much to the low end.<br /><br />Low versatility - While I don't expect every distortion pedal to have a mid-range control, and excessive EQ knobs can make some distortion pedals unwieldy to use, this pedal probably could have benefited from one.  While it's tone does something like an 80's Marshall sound, the inability to scoop the mids prevents you making it sound meaner and muffled.  This is unfortunate because it actually has quite a bit of gain/sustain on hand, but you can't voice it to sound \\"more metal\\".  For soloing, that sustain definitely comes in handy, and it's more musical than many other \\"distortion\\" pedals.  But, again, the lack of more EQ control means that you either like the voicing or you don't.  At times, I thought that there was a weird \\"parked wah-wah pedal\\" sound when I was playing higher notes, and you really can't change that.  This is very much a mid-to-high gain distortion pedal, and you cannot roll back the gain for any type of clean boost.<br /><br />FINAL IMPRESSIONS:<br /><br />Immediately upon plugging it in, I came up with the closest comparable pedal I had played, which is my Joyo US Dream (itself a clone of the Suhr Riot).  Both of them that 80's Marshall high-gain sound, though in a side-by-side test, the Tonebug Distortion had less low end than both the Joyo US Dream and a BOSS DS-1.  However, some may prefer it over those pedals anyway, and it certainly is better suited for soloing than the fizzy, thin high-end of a stock DS-1.<br /><br />Ultimately, it didn't turn out to be the \\"dud\\" that I thought it could be, but it also isn't a total winner.  There are a lot of excellent distortion pedals on the market for under $100, including this year's new MXR Super Badass Distortion.  I can't recommend the Tonebug over a pedal like that, but for the right price and the right user, it could be a good match.am (itself a clone of the Suhr Riot).
