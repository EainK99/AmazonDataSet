These monitors are very clear for my home studio. I listened to them next to krk(a mushy sound to me) and the Yamaha hr5s( a lot of midrange). I'm upgrading from m audio av40s so this was a big jump. When icing on these, then playing back the tracks at my shows through the pa, I am not getting any unexpected results. I am happy with these so far
