This is an odd cymbal.  i dont think I would call it a crash in the traditional sense.  It has more of a gong sound.  It is a heavy cymbal with more of a &#34;poing&#34; sound.  For $30 I got it just to see, hard to mess up for that $.<br />I cant see using it as a crash, not something I would start the beat with.  It is more of a sound effect than a crash.  Hopefully they sent the right one as there is no marking on the cymbal denoting it's purpose.  It just says the brand name.<br />If I saw (heard) this in a music store I'd be unlikely to go home with it.
