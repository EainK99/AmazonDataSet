For 100 bucks, there's not much to complain about with the Presonus Audiobox iOne.  You get a mike and instrument input, head phone monitor and level controls. All you need to grab two tracks (vocal and instrument).  SO a good choice for a singer-songwriter, perhaps (though something like a small Zoom unit might do just as well.). The box itself is rather straightforward and seems to do the job. The value bit here is in the software included. If that's useful to you, then it might make this an attractive choice.  It lets you take those tracks you just captured and do something with them, at least prep them a bit for a demo or further work.<br /><br />I need some more time with the software to really evaluate it properly, but it seems to do the job and has some nice features (effects, virtual instruments, rhythm/beats, etc.). It also supports midi which I sometimes find useful. Since I work mainly with my laptop, not an iPad, it works for me. So I think this is a solid 4 star (&#34;I like it&#34;) item as it's a good value for the price and the included software is a nice plus.
