This seems to a great tuner for the money. I have only used it for a couple of days.  It is very visible and easy to tell when you are at pitch. It also allows some tweaking. The clamp is heavy duty.The company emailed a letter size owners manual which was nice to have.<br /><br />My other tuner is a Crescendo which is slightly smaller and also a good buy- have had it over a year.
