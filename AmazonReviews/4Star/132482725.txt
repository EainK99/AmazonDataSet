Was afraid I might break these connectors by trying to pry them open (but the manufacturer's website mentioned prying and I gave it a try). Get a very small screwdriver. Hold the connector so the wire is pointing away/toward you, and pry the LED strip end of the connector open flipping it from left to right (or right to left) - IT DOESN'T FLIP TOWARD OR AWAY FROM YOU. AND IT DOESN'T SLIIIIDE OUT, EITHER. The connector's hinge is on a top corner of the plastic (next to the \\"dots\\"). The small dots in the plastic on one side have \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" signs in them and the hinge is just to the left or right of these \\"dots\\". You can pry by turning the connector over and prying at the slit visible on the bottom side corner (this is the opposite side from the \\"dots\\").<br /><br />As for wiring, LED stands for Light-Emitting Diode. In electronics a diode will allow current to pass only in one direction. Therefore, it is very important to have your power source connected correctly. If the \\"+\\" side of your LED Light or Strip is connected to the \\"-\\" side of your power source you aren't going to get light. That's the way LED lights work.<br /><br />As for sliding the LED strips in, just do it and then wriggle the end of the strip left-to-right until it seats well. Of course the connectors inside the clips are the two metallic leads. Make sure they slip over the exposed connectors labeled \\"-\\" and \\"+\\" on the end of your LED strip. If the leads are under the strip (adhesive side) you won't have a connection and the LED's won't light.<br /><br />Happy LED-ing!
