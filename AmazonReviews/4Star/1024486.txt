Pros: This tuner performs as advertised and helps me keep my Ukulele in tune, so I am happy.<br /><br />Cons: I would like to see this Tuner packaged in something other than a Blister Pack as that plastic degrades very little in a landfill. Perhaps they exist already, but I would like to see a similar clip-on Tuner with a USB port so that it could be charged by the computer, or even a small solar panel. Using a &#34;hearing aid&#34; battery is in my opinion, not a very sustainable idea - throwing them in the trash in California is even illegal, and there are few places/retailers that accept them for disposal.
