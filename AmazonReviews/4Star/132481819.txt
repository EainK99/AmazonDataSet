I have over 100 cassettes from years ago. This is a nice product to transfer them to  computer. Easy to use, once you know to use line in if mic doesn't work. That's the only complaint; why don't they tell you that? It has to run at regular speed, so it's slow. But you get to listen at the same time. I definitely recommend this product. You can use your tape player & their sw & cable.
