The Pyle was a non playable toy. This guitar is playable and I am giving it to my 2yo son to learn on, or bang on. Here's a hint, tune it to A instead of E. The short scale needs more string tension. I'd give it 5 stars but its still a bit cheap feeling. My 2yo won't know the difference but a least this one will tune and play. Works for a child's beginner guitar.
