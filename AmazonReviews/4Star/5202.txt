This marching snare is a good one to get if you want something to practice with, or if you're a beginning student. The carrier will need to be assembled, but doing this isn't as hard as it sounds. Even though the product description on this site doesn't mention it, this drum also comes with a standard drum key. The sticks, while a little on the lighter side, will work well for this drum. My only real gripe about it is the lack of a back support belt or something similar on the carrier. But for 179 bucks, it's not bad.
