Perfect for my tween-age daughter to add audio walk-through on her Minecraft videos. Just plug into the appropriate jack-style port on the back of the PC. This particular mic is very lightweight and does NOT have an on/off switch (hence the 4 star rating) nor does it have USB connection; most definitely not what I would consider to be a professional level mic but for our needs it is fine. The recorded audio is clear without any hissing, buzzing, etc. but is pretty sensitive to picking up background noises so make sure you are in a quiet setting when using. Overall a good mic for everyday recording.
