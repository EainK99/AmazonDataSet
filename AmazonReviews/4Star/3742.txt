I have a Alesis io2 audio interface, but for anyone writing bad reviews for this product usually its because they don't know how to set up the audio interface and usually are beginners expecting everything to work for them as soon as they plug something in.<br /><br />I worked with this product and it was good.<br /><br />You got to learn the tool your using to use it right people!
