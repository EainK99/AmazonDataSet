This guitar arrived in great condition, I was able to tune it quickly. I teach private lessons and will be renting this to a new student. Its not a super high quality guitar, but for a beginner it is a great instrument to learn on. I would recommend this to someone wanting to try guitar but not ready to invest in a great guitar. This will get the job done.
