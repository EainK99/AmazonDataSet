I bought this for my own amusement and never expected the fine instrument that it is.  This will definitely wind up being passed<br />down to a grandchild some day.  In the meantime, I am having fun playing with CD's.  My one disappointment is that the stand<br />that goes with it should have been made with real wood and in a color that would have gone nicely with furniture of all kinds.  The<br />stand is sturdy, no complaints with construction, just the rough appearance.
