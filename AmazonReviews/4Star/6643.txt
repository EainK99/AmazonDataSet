Equipped mainly for Serato, and difficult to use with other djing programs, the Mixtrack Pro II does come with its drawbacks. This is to be expected, due to the low price tag. The pitch fader doesnt have grooves to set it to '100%' tempo, which makes it annoying to reset your tempo precisely. Also, the gain markers are not very well defined. The jog wheel is, however, quite adept. Extremely touch sensitive, the black part of the jog wheel can be annoying to deal with, as people will be constantly touching while you try and DJ. If you are not disrupted, however, it has been engineered very well. I highly recommend this device for beginner DJs.
