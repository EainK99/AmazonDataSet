It's a fun way to hint at the island feel, I play in a small coffee house duo act and got this to just feature on 2 or 3 songs that have a reggae feel. Works good for that, but not a center stage piece at all, supposedly holds tune extremely well, we will see, my only gripe is the limited key and some notes take more whacking to get the same volume.
