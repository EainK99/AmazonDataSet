I had gotten a free USB light at a conference and found it useful when typing at night. It was never great, though. The gooseneck on the free one was weak and the light would soon droop, and it didn't feel right to leave it plugged in because it had no off switch.<br /><br />The Might Bright is better in all regards, and is worth the $10 it cost me.
