Clean channel on this amp sounds really nice and the EQ is very effective. There is a sweep knob in the EQ section that brings out the upper midrange. It's very good at highlighting the honk of Fender Strat single coil pickups. The amp can put out the volume and will get natural speaker breakup/overdrive at full volume. I think it would work in a band setting if you were not going for loud clean tones and appreciate the sound of light overdrive. The distortion/overdrive channel of the amp isn't that great but it's not terrible for a solid state amp. Reverb is subtle and not that great in my opinion. The chorus sounds good and is very usable. Headphone jack is nice for late night practice sessions. The amps takes pedals nicely too. I wouldn't say this is a light amp but it won't break your back moving it either. The build quality seems good and solid to me. Overall, I think the pros outweigh the cons in this amp and it is probably one of the better solid state amps on the market in this price range. Keep rockin'.
