The Blue Nessie microphone is a nice solution for those who need a desktop or budget studio mic.  For podcasts, live sessions, narration, you name it - the Blue Nessie is a very simple and yet effective way to get good quality recordings on a budget.<br /><br />Setup takes just a few moments - for me at least, on Windows 8. Simply plug the mic into the USB port and give it a minute for the OS to install the PnP drivers. Then go to Control Panel » Audio Hardware and make your configuration settings and options.  I have found that Nessie needs the gain (signal volume) turned up to about 100% in order to be effective.<br /><br />The built-in pop filter is good, and there are three settings: Voice, Instrument (or music), and Raw.  The last basically passes the audio signal through unchanged, letting you rely on your other processing hardware or software to deal with it. Voice is the obvious choice for recording your speaking.  To my ear, the Nessie adds some compression to the signal when set to Voice, but not enough to be too distracting. The result is a richer and fuller sounding voice recording, which I like.<br /><br />I do have  a few complaints with Nessie.  First, I didn't like that I had to boost the signal gain to 100% in order for the mic to pick up normal speaking voice at a distance of 1 foot or so.  I feel it should be more sensitive than that. Secondly, the onboard headphone capabilities are a nice feature - but need improvement.  The signal strength is incredibly weak, and I had to set the system and software volume to full in order to get any decent volume - and when I did I was also getting additional hum and noise due to the high setting. Also, the volume control dial on the base of Nessie (for headphone volume) cannot be operated with one hand.  There are times that this is a huge nuisance, having to hold the mic with one hand and turn the dial with the other.  Lastly, the Mute button does not provide much, if any tactile feedback. I honestly thought the button was broken, until I learned the trick. Pushing the button to turn Mute on/off is like pressing a button that is painted on - there is no feel of \\"in\\" and \\"out\\". Thankfully, the ring of light near the base of Nessie will begin to blink when Mute is turned on - which is the only way you'll know (unless you're watching a signal meter).<br /><br />Overall, I like the Blue Nessie and it meets my needs. If you are looking for pro quality audio, I would advise you to look further and be willing to spend more. But at its price, Nessie does a nice job and provides very simple yet good quality recording abilities.the button was broken, until I learned the trick.
