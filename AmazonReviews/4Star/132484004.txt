Very cool. Tracks the guitar input (I have my Korg SG plugged in there) a little slow and watch your vocal vibrato - once that's done, used on the right songs it is very nice. The lower harmony is not very usable, but my voice is lower to start with - that's not a fault of the unit. For the price it's a very solid unit, easy to use and, used tastefully, can be a great extra tool for small groups or soloists. Just don't overdo it.
