I bought this and decided to test it outside my building.  I used the Fogger Machine Fluid and in about 3-4 minutes the light was on telling me I was able to start it up.  I was surprised by the quality of the fog.  Neighbors came out wondering if there was a fire.  This fog just lingered too.  Can't wait to use it for some gigs!<br />The remote must be activated within 16-24ft I noticed.  You must aim directly at an unobstructed receiver.  The remote triggers it on.....it stays on until you turn it off it seemed and since I was not about to let it choke the street up, I HAD to turn it off.<br />The fogger powers up when you plug it in so be aware it is getting hot once it has a power supply.  it stays hot until you unplug it.  The remote just turns on the fogger part but not the unit itself.<br />I expect the 32oz (1qt) bottle of fluid to last quite a while since I am not one to overdo the effect.<br />I will try to note how many gigs it lasted me later.  But not all my customers want a fogger.<br />Any other questions about this go ahead and respond. I will try to answer soon.<br />only giving 4 stars at this time
