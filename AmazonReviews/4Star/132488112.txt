Basically, the only problems I've had with it is it auto-adjusting back up to 100% with no warning or anything. It also picks up pretty much every noise you make, even shifting to a more comfortable condition (obviously depending on where you sit). If you're computer is anywhere near where your mic is sitting, it'll pick up the hum of the table vibrating, so you'll most likely want to get a shock mount with it as well. Or look into other mics. Overall I enjoy it, but I could have done better (but I got it at a reduced price, so I suppose it was worth it).
