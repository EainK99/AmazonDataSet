I'm not sure one can find another mixer with this much flexibility, number of channels, sound quality and effects at this price range (and at this size range for that matters to some). I think I have tested every IN and OUT of this mixer and it is all good sound. I'm impressed. Only two more things would make it perfect in my opinion: on/off switch (oh come on!) and a distortion effect.
