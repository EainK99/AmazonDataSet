This is a very decent trumpet case for the price.  My b-flat trumpet fit just fine.  The padding inside is a little bit thin, but should be adequate. There is some storage room next to the trumpet and two storage compartments for mouthpieces.  The case should be fine for light duty use although I would not recommend it for situations where it might be subject to abuse.  Definitely recommended for what it is.
