I've been using this off and on for a couple years and it's solid.<br /><br />The tone controls are adequate and I use a floor processor for effects and distortions.<br /><br />The clean sound is decent and it has enough power to use with live drums in practice.<br /><br />The covering is super rugged and it hasn't received a scar yet, although it also hasn't been roughly handled either.<br /><br />I can recommend this unless you'd prefer a model with amp modeling, but as I said I prefer a separate for that myself.
