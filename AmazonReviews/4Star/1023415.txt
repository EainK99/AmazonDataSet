These are my favorite round wound bass strings.  I tend to prefer flats, but these are nice.  They get better when broken in as well.  I have another couple sets on order to try different gauges.  Buying two sets at once probably only makes sense if you're going to string two basses, but I do like to have a spare.  Great tone with a good growl, but still thumpy enough for blues.  I like them.
