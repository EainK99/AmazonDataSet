As the title says.  It is inexpensive (relatively speaking).  The other products are way more expensive.  It is a foam.  I was expecting a hard foam, but this is more like a hard sponge.  The adhesive is applied to the entire back side, so be aware.  It is quite effective.  I used it to contain some of the noise of my portable AC.  It really cut down a lot of noise when the compressor is turned on.  You can't cut out all the noise because the bulk of it comes out from the fan, but so far I'm happy with the performance vs. price.
