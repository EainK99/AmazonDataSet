I have purchased several of these and I'm pleased with them. I use them in a 12 x 18 music studio for fun, two of these in combination with a couple of small flowers fills up the entire room. I have them set to sound controlled and so far the work like a champ. I've had them running for just a few hours now but I have no complaints. they come with a tripod stand which actually fits a standard camera mount...so if you are looking for a small tripod camera mount on the cheap, the tripod could help you out.<br /><br />If you were a dj and just starting out, you could spice up your set with a couple of these, if you are an established DJ playing a large room, you need to go the pro route on your lighting. If you are having a party or jam with your buddies...grab 2 or 4 of these and add a couple of other flower/spots/strobe and you'll have a blast.
