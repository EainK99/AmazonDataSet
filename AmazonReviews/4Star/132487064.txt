I read a lot of reviews on different websites on this strap before I bought it and knew of the problem with the strap holes being too tight. But bought it anyway because I really liked the design and figured I could make it work. This is a really good quality leather strap that has two layers of leather sewn together. The problem with the holes being tight is not that they are too small, it is because the two layers of leather are too thick. What I ended up doing is using a razor knife to trim away some of the leather off of the top layer of leather, and only around one side or edge of the hole, being careful not to trim away too much. It took a few times of taking a little at a time without taking too much to get it right. I slid a butter knife in between the layers so I only trimmed the top layer leaving the bottom thinner layer to fit into the groove on the guitar strap pegs.<br /><br />Obviously you should not have to go through all that trouble with a new strap that costs this much, and it should be addressed by the manufacturer. They need to try these on an actual guitar before they sell them. This was even more challenging in my case because I have an acoustic/electric and the back peg is bigger for the cord to plug in to it.<br /><br />However, I am still glad I bought it and went through the trouble to make it work. This is a really nice quality strap that should last me years, and it is the nicest christian design I have seen on a guitar strap.<br />As far as the folds in the leather, again, this is a thick high quality strap and the folds naturally occur from it being rolled up to ship it. I just hung mine up on a hanger after working the leather a little to soften it up. This will fix itself in time as the leather softens with use. I would rather have that problem than have a thin flimsy strap.
