These are a great alternative to Elixir strings and make my Tele sound the way she did when I brought her home. There is no definitive answer as to what strings you should use, but in my humble opinion, you can't go wrong with these.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />I put these on a Yamaha AEX500 hybrid guitar that I have and they are exceptional. The tone is crisp and clean. Will definitely buy again over Elixirs.
