I am a novice, learning how to play. I think is great for practice... For the stage, I think this would work as an option with your other pedals (but not as your only one pedal since this is a single foot switch pedal).<br /><br />Construction: Pedal seems well constructed (metal and NOT plastic); nice clicker for the foot switch.<br /><br />Effects: Offers 100 effects that are simulated to sound like the original pedals and amps (ie, Boss DS-1, Big Muff, BOSS CH-1 SUPER CHORUS. Fender Deluxe Reverb)....and with the Bluetooth capabilities, you can download more for $1-$2 each (great option BUT I don't know if it is necessary since there are so many effects already built in).  You can download the PDF manual online, which will show you all the effects it offers [...]<br />You can also download the Zoom StompShare App from the Apple App Store to see the options to purchase more effects.<br /><br />Multiple Options: You can combine up to 6 different effects into one patch/pedal effect. You can set up a foot switch cycle with several pedal effects/patches (ie, A = DS-1, B = Super Chorus, C = Empty/bypass/clean amp).<br /><br />Sound Quality: As a novice, I can not compare the sound difference between the original pedals to this digital pedal. However, I do think it sounds good and with the options of modify each effect... I am sure you can get what you want.<br /><br />User-friendly: I do feel that their is a learning curve to this pedal. I think it could be confusing & difficult to use for those that are NOT tech-savvy. I think I have learned about 80% of its capabilities with 2-3 hours worth of play. I do not understand the tempo option but it could be because of my lack of guitar knowledge & inexperience. If you are going to get this pedal, I would recommend going through the manual first. Don't be afraid to change settings because you can easily reset the pedal back to its factory setting.<br /><br />Battery Life: With two (AA) batteries, it offers only 5-7 hours of play. I will eventually purchase an AC adapter (which is not provided with the pedal).<br /><br />Recommendation: Yes, I would recommend this. It offers multiple effects and modification options for a fair price (it even has tuner which is probably worth $25+ itself). I will follow up after a couple of months to update my rating. I gave it 4/5 because its not as user-friendly for the non-techies.ch is not provided with the pedal).    Recommendation: Yes, I would recommend this.
