It was recommended by a friend who works as an artist. He used to bring this when he do painting in some parks. It is very easy to carry, the voice quality is great, worth every penny on it. I move it around when I do housework or cook. but I cannot charge my ipad on it even through the USB, i don't understand why it is not working. Doesn't matter, absolutely love and enjoy it.
