I've been testing out my new Q502USB for the past week in preparation for a new podcast and so far I'm quite happy.  I have the unit going into my PC, recording with 3 microphones (1 XLR Shure SM 58 & 2 1/4&#34; MPE's) simultaneously and the resulting recording is sweet with very little noise (if at all noticeable).  I usually record with a mic setup through my Mackie 1402-VLZ-Pro, but my podcast needs a bit of mobility and the tiny size of the Q502USB is just what I was looking for.  You can easily squeeze it into a laptop bag, with the laptop! The compressor seems to do a fine job, but I'm only recording talking and not dynamic singing vocals, so I'll give it a real test later.  So far / clean, rich sound - especially for the very low price.  CON: Only one negative so far.  The power adapter cord is not very snug into the rear of the unit.  It comes out easily and I had to wiggle it around to actually get the unit to power On.  This seems like such an obvious design flaw and I know I read another review that mentioned the same issue.  I doubt they'll bother with a redesign for such an inexpensive board, but they should.  Too bad I'll have to tape the cord on to be sure it doesn't slip out during a critical recording session.
