I would give the guitar 5 stars alone but a few things that came with the bundle weren't quality. I am a born again guitar player. I haven't played in 6 years but decided to pick it back up and this guitar for the price is top of the line first class. Solid Mahogany body, beautiful fret board and sturdy hard case.<br /><br />The only 2 complaints are the stand and strap. The stand is poorly made but does the job. The strap reminds me of a cheap gym bag strap. You better off buying a quality leather strap for this exquisite guitar.<br /><br />The price was spot on, the tuner, easy to use and allows you to tune your guitar to more than one frequency, medium pics (I prefer soft) and an extra set of strings.<br /><br />I would recommend this guitar to any beginner or somebody like myself who is getting back in to playing but doesn't want to break the bank.
