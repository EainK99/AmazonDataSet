I ordered this along with replacement strings for my 6 string guitar and my 12 string guitar. It worked great for the 6 string. Easy to use, easy to read, easy to tune. It even worked great on the 12 string until I got to the thin G string. It would not register any higher than the thin E string. I'll be using the tuner for my 6 string. Great little tuner for your 6 string guitar.
