This is not a high-end pedal, so I didn't expect a top notch design. The build quality met my expectations. It works well for my purpose, which is for a light duty on a Yamaha electronic drum pad KP65. I am unsure how well it would hold up on a real bass drum. One problem (for me) is that the beater angle, and kick stroke, are not adjustable. The pedal provides only one swing angle, which for me is too wide. There is no adjustment for the pedal travel, or for the resting positon of the pedal and beater. But, considering the low cost, I consider this a decent pedal for casual use such as mine.
