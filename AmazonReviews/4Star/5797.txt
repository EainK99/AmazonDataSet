The strings themselves sound great like the regular nyxl strings but they need to tell users the length from the ball end to the taper. I figured since they're &#34;optimized for a 30 inch scale&#34; that they'd fit my schecter blackjack atx c-8 which is a 28&#34; scale. But since it's a string through body (which should've only added less than 1.5&#34; since that's about the depth of the guitar at that point) the taper on the 8th string ended up halfway between the first fret and the nut. Despite sounding and feeling great on the higher frets, it felt a little loose and the intonation was off on the lower frets which is of course an issue since if I'm playing on that 8th string I want to play low.<br /><br />Now I'm using a prosteel 9-42 set with a 56 and 70 for the B and F# and am very pleased<br /><br />4 stars because the strings sound and feel great as intended I only docked a star because to my knowledge they don't give you anyway of knowing what length the string is from the ball to the taper. If they fit then absolutely buy them.
