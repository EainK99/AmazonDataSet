I have a Martin D28 that I am taking out of the country early next year, and I was concerned about damage to my favorite acoustic. I know this case will protect it from airline &#34;baggage tossers&#34; and give me peace of mind that it will arrive undamaged.<br /><br />It is NOT a case for everyday use, unless you travel with your guitar exclusively, because it is a big and heavy case. But it has wheels and handles in just the right places, which make it easy to move. Great design, I have another SKB for my 335 and love it.
