I'm writing a short review and giving a 4 because don't wanna bash this. But its between a 3 and 4.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Good distortions and plenty.  Good delay and reverb.  Good chorus.  All in all many good useable effects.  I had a boss me 70 and this better sounds.  Good cabs and amps. Pretty easy to customize and edit.  sounds great through my Marshall dsl jcm 2000 half stack with 1960av cab.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Non natural decay of notes.  Too many features that need cycle through to find.  Screen not so great.  Software sub par.  Support not great and return emails slowly.  Looper ruins tone, but looper decent for jamming and practice.  Wah not great and expression pedal not so great.<br /><br />Don't like layout and lack of detail on screen, and need to cycle through options in editing and finding sounds.<br /><br />All in all a high 3, but needs to update this product to more user friendly.  ***Good for money though.
