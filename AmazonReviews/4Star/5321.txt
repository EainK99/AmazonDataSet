I bought this to use as a compact music stand that can easily be stored in the closet, as well as transporting it to concerts. Happily. It does everything I need, and is also a substantial, sturdy stand. It doesn't tip easily, is readily adjustable, and is simply better in every significant way than the wire stands many people use. The one drawback is that it is significantly larger than those stands, even when collapsed. But that's a tradeoff I'm more than happy to make.
