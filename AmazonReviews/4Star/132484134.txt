Very nice for the price!  Great sound, #9 opening, and a solid chunk of metal make me give this mouthpiece two thumbs up.  The only reason I took off a star is because the bore opens up rather abruptly which may or may not be affecting the airflow through the mouthpiece and affecting how my reed is vibrating on the high notes when I growl my sax.  I like the fact that it's a shallower opened mouthpiece so for someone who's just started back playing after 15 years off, it's really helping while I'm building my lung capacity back up.
