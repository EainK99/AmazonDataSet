No I'm not a musician, but I am in radio in a large broadcast market. I bought this as a backup to a Marantz unit that cost 5 times as much. As you might expect the Marantz is more versatile, but this little unit is aptly named. It's a 'handy recorder'. The built-in mics sound just fine. The stereo effect can be a bit much and as far as I can tell there's no way to record in mono. With the right cord, it works well to record phone interviews. . It's tougher than it feels. I've been pretty rough on it in a commercial setting and it's still ticking. Battery life is superior to the more expensive recorder I normally use. You'll want to use some sort of wind screen if you plan on using the built-in mics. It's limited somewhat with only a line level input if you plan to use an external mic. Internal mics are pretty sensitive and work best up close. they pick up a fair amount of ambient noise. I also had some minor issues when transferring and working with wav files in Adobe Audition. Mp3 works fine. USB connectivity to the computer works well. Haven't tried the included software as I edit in ProTools or Audition, but it seems like a nice extra. Is this 'professional' gear?  No, but it comes darn close for a fifth of the price. I'd recommend to anyone who wants an inexpensive recorder with USB.connectivity.
