I was confronted with having to transport my bass guitar via the airlines and did a fair amount of research before picking this case. It was a tough decision made tougher by conflicting reviews, the case price, and size. My bass is a Fender 5 string Jazz bass II, probably worth more to me in sentimental value as opposed to resale. I finally decided on this case, and just came back from my first trip with it. Some observations:<br /><br />1. This case is not small. It fits under one of the beds in my house, but just barely. It fit into the back of a small rental car with some struggle.<br />2. This case is not light. With bass, cables,  and other miscellanea it was 35lbs. on the scale at the airport. If you gig a bunch locally it will probably not be your default case if you get tired of lugging gear.<br />3. The exterior is well made, and seems to seal  well when closed. It definitely gives you a feeling that your instrument is protected.<br />4. As another reviewer pointed out: the internals of this case are not 'plush'. Actually there is a plush strip on the lid of the case where the fretboard could potentially make contact. If you think about it this is by design: the purpose of this case is to protect the guitar in an environment where it will be potentially stored upside down, thrown, and have things stacked upon it. If the guitar is moving vertically inside the case this could cause damage.<br />5. As another reviewer said: it will be assumed that you are bringing a hunting rifle through luggage.<br />6. I had some concerns that my 5 string bass would fit in the cavity, this was a complete non-issue. I believe this case could support many jazz or precision style bodied basses up to 6 strings. As a matter of fact, I had to shove two small towels around the bass body horns to keep it locked against the cavity since there is so much room. My concern is that the bass would move around in the cutout cavity and the head stock would bang against the other side of the case in transit. The towel trick seemed to work well.<br />7. I could not tell if the strings were making contact with the 'plush' part of the case lid. I followed a suggestion I read online and loosened the strings prior to transit.<br />8. The wheels definitely help, as do the handles located around the case. The case has good balance overall and can be stood up vertically without having to hold it (at least mine could).<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the purchase. A bass is obviously a larger scale when compared to a guitar, so I felt like I would have to check it into luggage at the airline. This case gave me piece of mind. It was a little hard to pony up the $$$, but after one trip I have several large gashes on the outside of the case. It was also raining when I was getting off the plane - something to consider.<br /><br />I hope this review helps somebody to make a final decision.eemed to work well. 7.
