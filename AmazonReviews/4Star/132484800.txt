Bought about five years ago. Played off and on during that time.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />As advertised, easy to set up, authentic classical guitar feel - though you must get used to how close the body sits to the player. Good sound.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Good sound but not great. The piezo &#34;quack&#34; is very evident. Surprising given the price and the quality of piezo-electric pickups available today<br /><br />Battery life is an issue. There is no &#34;auto-off&#34;. Better not forget to flip the switch. You'd think at this price it could switch itself off.<br /><br />Biggest complaint: no built-in tuner. Again you'd think at this price that would be featured. I have since added an NS micro tuner, but still, you're not really getting the features at this price point you'd expect from a less-expensive &#34;real&#34; classical guitar.
