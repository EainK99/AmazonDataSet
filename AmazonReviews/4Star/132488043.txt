I use this product when playing my Baritone horn while playing for a Peru Church Band, it works great while playing with one hand and holding music on the other it's worth what you pay for it, without it, playing the Baritone Horn would hurt my arms, back and I guess everything else. It's a great strap for holding the Baritone Horn if you play this instrument, purchase this item, it's greeeeeeeeeeeet.
