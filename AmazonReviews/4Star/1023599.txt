I am currently using this stand for my guitalele (Yamaha GL1) which is approximately the size of a baritone ukulele, and it just fits. The upper fork, when extended to its max height, is still a little tight on my guitalele's neck, but it works fine. The build is very study (doesn't feel cheap) and it folds up nicely, which will be handy for when I move overseas in a year. I'm planning to buy another one of these stands for my soprano ukulele.
