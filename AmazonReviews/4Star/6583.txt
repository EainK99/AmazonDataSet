Does exactly what it needs to do.  Nothing fancy but it works.  It is nicely adjustable for the price.  It won't quite fit a standard sized sheet music book when it is opened and both the left and right page are visible, but this hasn't been an issue yet b/c I've been able to clamp one side down and the other stays down.
