I purchased this capo for my teenage son who's learning guitar.  He originally wanted the black color but I showed him the other colors available and he got excited that it came in the silver color.  He loves playing guitar and after getting this capo, he's even more enthusiastic about playing.  It's so easy to use and very well made.  Just squeeze to clip on and off.
