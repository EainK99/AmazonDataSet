This thing will make any room, or any object you place it behind, a LOT more prominent and interesting. The LED behavior manages to be unpredictable yet reactive in a way that makes it feel a bit like a 'toy', in a good way. It's blinding to look right at this thing, and the light is somewhat directional without a reflector to help it out, so you'll want to mount it very carefully and pay attention (whilst standing back) to see how it looks.<br />Great device, lots of fun.
