I play in a Beatles Tribute band - I use these on my Gretsch 6122 to help approximate George Harrison's sound.  I have tried the Pyramid brand and found the Thomastik sounds the same and they cost less (though they are not cheap).  If you invest in these strings I would highly recommend using Fast Fret before and after every performance - in may experience that has extended the life of the strings 3 to 4 times, and keeps them sounding almost like new.
