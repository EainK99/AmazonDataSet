lasts longer than wood reeds. I use if on my hard rubber #5 mouthpiece, not the metal mouthpiece. Legere Signature doesn't bend as it ages like the cheaper Legere's do. I used to be a purist for wood reeds, but not any more. I use this for settings where I need to blend; with the church ensemble. I like a carbon fiber for big band. It's great for settings where you're not playing continuously. Also great for practicing.
