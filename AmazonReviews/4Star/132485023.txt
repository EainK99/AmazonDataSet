I bought this for my 10 year old daughter...she was always asking to play my guitar, but her hands are too small...so I bought this. In context, it's excellent. I mean, it's a $100 guitar...its exactly what I'd expect...arrived sooner than expected, well packaged and intact. The strings buzzed something fierce, particularly the low E and A strings...I bought some new Ernie Ball Standard Slinky's, took the stock ones off and loosened the truss rod...adjusted the bridge a little too...problem solved...the tuning pegs could be a little better...one of them is really stiff and hard for my daughter to tune but remember, it's not a 68' Strat...it's exactly what you get in a $100 guitar.
