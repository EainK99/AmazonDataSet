After a couple of close drops with my regular strap coming loose, I ordered this guitar strap.  The strap has plenty of length.  The lock mechanisms are genius.  They will rotate on to you strap pin to lock into place.  Once locked your guitar is going nowhere.  The only con that I have discovered is how slick the strap is.  It's difficult to just let my guitar hang down from my body, the headstock will slide downward toward the floor if I don't support it with my fretting hand.  I'm going to try to incorporate something to add to the strap to keep it from slipping across my shoulder.
