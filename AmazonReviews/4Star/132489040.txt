my oldest daughter (12) is the oboe player in the family.  she is hard on reeds (she's learning), so she goes through them pretty fast.  she normally uses a medium reed, so i thought we'd give this one a try and see how it compares for sound and durability.  i only gave this 4 stars for the time, because these questions remained unanswered.  as soon as my daughter can give me feedback, i will let you know.
