Light weight, easy to hold, and I love the crisp, breathy sound. My only issue is the holes are a little too small, and the high notes are really hard to get to, but that might just be me.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good ocarina to start with. Definitely better than that TOTMC one.
