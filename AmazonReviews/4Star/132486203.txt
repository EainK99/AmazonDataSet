It isn't the most sturdy thing in the world but it made well. I don't know how well it is for teenagers or younger but works fine for me (29). Holds my books open easily and takes the weight of medium heavy books. Haven't tried a hymn book yet but I think it would be fine holding that open even. Great buy.
