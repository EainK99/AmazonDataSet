I bought this to replace my previous karaoke microphone with the same brand which is broken. The microphone is very nice for Karaoke party but it very easy to break (that may be the case for most of the microphones). This is the fourth microphone I have bought with the same model. Take the price into account, it worth of it. The sound quality is among the best in the three kinds of microphone I have used in the past for my karaoke machine. I bought two this time just in case.
