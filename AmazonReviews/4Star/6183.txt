I want to first state that I almost cried when I got these in the mail because it was the bigger aux (the ones that you would plug into an amp for instance... perfect for a DJ, etc but not for me!) and I really wanted a 3.5mm so I could listen to music on my smartphone... I almost sent them back but then REALIZED THAT YOU CAN SCREW IT OFF AND POOF! IT'S A 3.5MM JACK! I felt so silly... (maybe I should have read the info?) So yes, it converts from studio aux to 3.5mm. (Sorry, I don't know the exact terms.)<br /><br />Pros: Came packaged very nicely and arrived on time. They are definitely high quality, which is rare for the super affordable price... you really get a good deal with these! As previously mentioned, the aux female does convert to 3.5mm by screwing it off. It will fit about any size head because it is easily adjustable. The ear pieces are really nice because they are cushioned very well, which is ideal for someone who has them on for long periods of time. (Which brings me to the only con I have on these so far...)<br /><br />Cons: I wear glasses and after a while it starts to hurt my head because it pushes down on the sides of the glasses and I get a major headache. This would happen with any studio headphones, unfortunately. However, they feel very comfortable without my glasses on, so it shouldn't be a problem for most people!
