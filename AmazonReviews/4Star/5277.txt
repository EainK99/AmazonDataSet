I've been playing guitar for almost 6 years now and have been through my fair share of clip-on tuners. I got this one after doing a decent amount of research, so here's my experience with it over the last couple months:<br /><br />Pros: incredibly out of the way and unobtrusive, good mode options (metronome, flip display, etc.), color spectrum (red&#62;yellow&#62;green) based on how close the note is to being in tune<br /><br />Cons: not as accurate as some of the larger clip-on tuners out there (eg. Planet Waves or Shark tuners), clip feels a bit flimsy<br /><br />So here's my quick take: great little tuner to chuck on your guitar and just leave, but you might wanna have something else around if you need your good ol' six-string a little closer to true as far as the tuning is concerned.
