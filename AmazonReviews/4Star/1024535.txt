This is my first non-pawn-shop bow. I bought it on the advice of a much better fiddler than I (which isn't hard to be) who recommended &#34;one of those Chinese carbon fiber bows you can get for less than $100 online&#34;. Well, this is it.<br /><br />Do I sound like a pro? No, but this bow *is* much better than the bows I was using before.<br /><br />Perhaps someday I'll get good enough to warrant a better bow. For the time being, this is great!
