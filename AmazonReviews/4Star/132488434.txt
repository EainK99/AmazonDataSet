When using my laptop with a portable usb interface (sound devices usb pre 2) and yamaha HS50M monitors, I would get horrible noise related to laptop activity coming out of the monitors. The noise disappeared when I removed my laptop power cord. All the audio connections are balanced. I tried transformer isolation and ground lifts on the audio cables with no luck. Fortunately, this worked perfectly. It is more expensive than some other solutions that were reported to work for my problem (inserted into audio path). But for a portable setup, this is easier as it doesn't require you to carry and plug in 2 additional cables. Since I have to set up and tear down my portable setup at least once a week, that makes it worth the higher cost to me. I removed one star for the price. I'm no electrician, but it seems like it is probably overpriced for what it is. However, I'd buy it again now that I know it works. So I guess it's worth what we'll pay for it.
