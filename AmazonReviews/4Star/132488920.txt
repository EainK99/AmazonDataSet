This case is great quality wise, but the size is completely off.  Other reviews said it should probably fit a 42.  The guitar I bought this for is 41 and I can barley squeeze it in and zip it shut.  Returning it is a hassle through amazon, so I suppose I'll just deal with it.  Maybe it'll stretch a little???
