I will start off by saying the item works well and is a great value.  The one I received had a rattle in it - opened the casing to find a small loose nut that I had to re-secure. The unit is very compact and seems fairly well made and powers all of my pedals well with no feedback, etc.  I was using one of those one stops with daisy chain and it was a nightmare with popping sounds, feedback and shorts.<br /><br />This is real easy to set up and secured to my pedal board with some Velcro - takes very little space.  Only weird thing is that pedals will power up even if I don't turn this unit on.  So I have to still turn off every pedal after turning this off - not sure why that is so.<br /><br />Overall would definitely recommend for the price and functionality.
