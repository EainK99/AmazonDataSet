i'm a longtime Kun user; tried the Wolf just to see what it would do.<br /><br />Pros: Adjustability -- that you can bend the pad into whatever contour you want. And the pad is softer than a hard Kun rest.<br /><br />Cons: Stability. It's tricky to get this one placed and adjusted correctly. (Frankly, with all due respect to Amazon, this is the kind of thing best bought from a local shop where you can get help with the adjustments)<br /><br />Initially I was having the stability problem that other Amazon reviewers have noted. The legs rotated the wrong way and the fiddle would slide away from me until the rest basically fell off.<br /><br />There is a solution for that (no doubt part of the design). Rotate the \\"fixed\\" foot -- the side opposite the one with length adjustment --- all the way around and a little stainless steel locking bracket will float to the opposite side. It's quite clever.<br /><br />This allows you to use the rest either direction and provides decent stability.<br /><br />Conclusion: Not sure whether this is the right rest for me. The Kun still provides a more solid base.<br /><br />However, your mileage may vary. The greater softness and flexibility might help with neck and shoulder tension for those of us who are playing 6-8 hours a day. Maybe it make sense to keep both rests and alternate them, like changing shoes periodically.<br /><br />The Wolf needs to be set up carefully. It's a more complex mechanism than the Kun and takes some time to learn.
