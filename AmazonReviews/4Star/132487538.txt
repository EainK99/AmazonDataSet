For such a small (and inexpensive) unit, the Roland does quite well. The controls are easy to use and the sound quality is more than adequate for the things you would use this for - voices, of course, helping with musical instrument practice, recording your son's recital, and the like. Don't expect great sound quality from such small mics that are spaced so close. Addition of a small speaker would be nice - at present you must listen thru headphones.
