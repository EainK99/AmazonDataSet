A great starter instrument for the \\"musically challenged\\" such as myself.  Functional right out of the box.  Nice enough sound if you're not planning on taking it to Carnegie Hall.  Cheap enough to not feel too guilty if it starts collecting dust in the corner.  A couple of short how-to youtube videos later and my family was even starting to recognize the tunes I was playing!
