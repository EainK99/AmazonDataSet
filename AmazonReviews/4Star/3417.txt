It's an excellent  rack and holds acoustic cases and Les Paul style cases very well.  It's easy to put together and solid as a rock. It also looks terrific.  I took off a star for a few reasons.  First, mine was missing some screws - but not a deal breaker.  I had some screws that were a near perfect match and worked fine.  Second it does not hold Fender hard-shell cases very well - and I have a bunch.  Third, there are conflicting pictures in the instructions.  One diagram shows a piece going one way, and another diagram shows the same piece going the opposite way.  Both diagrams are in the same direction, so it is not an alternate view.  However, assembling the rack with the piece going either way worked - so again, not a deal breaker.  But those three reasons kept me from giving it five stars.  I was thinking about giving it three stars, but that would not be fair.  It's an excellent rack.  Even though I have many Fender cases, I have many acoustic cases and Les Paul style cases - I bought two.
