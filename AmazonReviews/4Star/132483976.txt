I picked up uke about a year ago and now have 4 ukes.  I swallowed the blue pill. I bought all that &#34;Aquila Nylgut is the ONLY ukulele string&#34; patter rampant in Amazon uke reviews, uke chat rooms, etc.  Apparently these people are all a bunch of sheep following each other around and there I was, right in there amongst them.<br /><br />That all changed for me when I recently bought a soprano Makala Dolphin as travel uke which comes with GHS Hawaiian black nylon strings stock.  I find these GHS Hawaiian strings are a very pleasing change of pace and sound totally like a ukulele should.  I left the stock strings on and bought more.<br /><br />So now that I've taken the red pill I know the truth and I am totally open to trying new ukulele strings.  I know what Aquilas do, it was the day in my ukulele journey to discover something else.  What I found with these black nylons was a time machine.<br /><br />You've heard this GHS Hawaiian tone on countless recordings dating back 60 or more years.  I recognized it instantly and my eyes went wide and the corners of my mouth went up.  This tone makes me smile!  It is a happy warm nostalgic serotonin gusher of a tone that puts you in Mellow-City in zero flat.<br /><br />A real bonus is that this one set works for both Soprano (standard) and Concert (Alto) size ukes.  So far as I know that makes it a scarcity but not totally unique as Martin markets a clear fluorocarbon called the M600 set that also works on both scales and there could be others I've not tried.<br /><br />I am so committed to these that I bought 5 sets of these GHS Hawaiians, so that will last me a while.  I have no intention of putting anything on this Dolphin soprano but these GHS black nylons.  This is a totally viable and fun tone and these strings are easy to play and intonate well.  The fact they are cheap is OK too, but I'd pay the same as the Aquila set costs for them if I had to because of the silky feel and old school tone.<br /><br />I've used GHS electric bass strings for decades. GHS is a quality USA company and even these uke strings are USA made.  That matters to me!  It also holds down the cost because when buying Italian made strings the US Dollar to Euro exchange rate is built into the price and is unfavorable to the US Dollar lately.  I think finding a USA made string you like makes good economic sense if you are in the USA, so I've been looking at alternatives to Aquilas and this is one option.<br /><br />These take a while to break in and hold tuning, but so do every other uke string set ever made.  These seem to take a wee bit longer than others to settle in.  To shorten the break in time for about the first week they are on at end of play for the day I tune these black nylons up a bit, to a full step up at the most, and leave it that way till retuning to play again the next day when I'll tune it back to normal. After about 2 weeks these settle in to be more stable and you don't need to stretch them anymore. I also think that once they settle in these strings intonate better on my little soprano than Nylgut, so I'll keep using them on it.  Your mileage may vary there.<br /><br />There is no such thing to me as a 5 star ukulele string because I've not found one string set that does everything well.  The GHS Hawaiian Standard set does the old island type tone well but doesn't do the punchy louder gut sound at all.  I'll keep using Aquila on other ukes and especially my tenor setup in Low-G, I merely wanted to say that these GHS Hawaiians are a perfectly viable choice on soprano or concert (alto) too.  There's a reason black nylons have been used on ukes of all price ranges for over 6 decades.  If they were truly trash they would have gone away long ago, yet here they be.  Listen to some old records and then listen to these strings.  You won't get that old school vintage tone with Nylgut because that old authentic Hawaiian tone only lives in black nylons.  If you have more than one soprano/concert, set one up with these GHS Hawaiians for a refreshing change of pace and see if it doesn't make you smile...just a little bit!it doesn't make you smile...just a little bit!
