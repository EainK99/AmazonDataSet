works great, does exactly as advertised, the only problem is of the 3 i've bought so far, the brightness of the blue LEDs has varied wildly, some are quite dim, and the first one i bought two of them never turned on, all nine plug ins still gave power, but it looks bad when the LEDs dont switch on with it.
