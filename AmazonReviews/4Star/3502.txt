Install was easy - relatively speaking. It's a tight fit in the tremolo cavity. I had to remove one of the four springs for the final fit. It works as advertised. Be warned, though: it does make noise when releasing from a bar dive/dip. The stopper bolt thuds when the term bridge returns to its neutral position. I don't know how to fix this. Perhaps some felt between the bolt and sustain block would help? We'll see but for now I'm not using the tremolo bar at all. That's how annoying it is. In this regard a Tremol-no would be a better option but install on that looks like a real pain and perhaps a job for a tech.<br /><br />Overall impression - it works but it's not as elegant as I had hoped. The fit is good and the low-profile ensured that my back cover went on flush.
