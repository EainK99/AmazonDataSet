I bought this to learn the dulcimer. I'm teaching myself and thought this would be a good one to start with and find out if I want to continue! I have to adjust the tuning often, but I understand this isn't really unusual. The sound isn't as light as some I've heard, but I expect a more expensive instrument might have the true dulcimer sound I'm looking for.
