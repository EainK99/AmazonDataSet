So i got theses headphones because I read review after review about how great they were and long lasting they were and they deff are built well!!! i wear glasses so they do bother my ears at times, since they sit on the ear and not over the ear, but i just have to figure out the right position to let them sit and they feel fine.... they are deff great sounding across all levels highs, mids, and lows. If by any means your looking to strap a subwoofer to your head then you dont want to buy these but for me i like to have just enough bass punch to give my music the flavor i like. they do cancel out noise and come with 2 ear covers, a velvet and a pleather which i didn't like to much personally.... overall though they ear great headphones and I am really glad that if anything breaks i can always rebuild them with spare parts! sold by Sennheiser
