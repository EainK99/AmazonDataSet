The quality on this guitar is real good.  I have a Roland Gr-55, it works good but not perfect with the unit.  When running guitar out from the Roland and all volume down there is still a small amount of volume that escapes the guitar.  I had to run my cable / wireless out of the guitar directly to the amp.
