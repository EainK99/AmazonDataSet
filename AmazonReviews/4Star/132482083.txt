Incredible build and sound quality.  The different diaphragm directional settings are great for different audio situations.  It has a wide Gain range, but honestly it's so sensitive that you don't even need to turn the gain up.<br /><br />On the down side, some sort of external noise filter is a must for this mic, as I have yet to find a foam filter that fits over the top (diaphragm dome is large).  Also, this thing is so heavy that it's hard to find a mic stand that will support its weight.  It's not really portable at all.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars if more accessories fit it.
