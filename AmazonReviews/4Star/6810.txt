Blue microphones come with a super crappy shock mount that breaks at the screw that tightens the hinge and angle of mic... This shock mount wraps around my Blue Baby bottle perfectly and snug fit.. Also the build quality surprisingly seems to be better made than blue's shock mount.. It has no problem holding it's weight and doesn't fall. Note that the black Neewer shock mount did NOT fit my Blue baby bottle. If you have a Blue Baby Bottle (I believe it's a 45mm mic) it will fit
