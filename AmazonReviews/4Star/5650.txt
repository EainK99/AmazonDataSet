This Kawai RX1 piano cover fitted my Kawai GE-30 close enough to not send it back.(both are 5'5&#34;)  It serves that purpose of keeping dust off the piano, but that's about it. The material seems thin for the price.  As a comparison, you can purchase a quilted packing blanket for less than $20, that would cover most baby grand pianos, and have probably 3x the protection.  But I'm sure if you needed a super durable cover, and wanted to sew it yourself, that would probably cost a pretty penny. But it looks attractive enough for my setting, and will keep the dust off, and most little hands. ;-)
