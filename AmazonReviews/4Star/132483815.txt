I used these lights to do some under cabinet lighting and they work great and provide high quality light with lots of control. after about 2 weeks the lights began falling down from the cabinets and I have had to remove them temporarily until i can find a better way to adhere them to the cabinets. the adhesive tape that is used on the product initially is low quality and does not last long. the LED's are great.
