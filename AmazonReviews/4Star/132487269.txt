Guitar lessons, guitar books, tuners, and the guitar itself adds up, so I was looking for a guitar case that protected my daughter's guitar without spending a lot more money. This does it and doesn't stand out on the ugly side like some other soft cases I saw. A little padding and a pocket for materials as well as back-pack style carrying or handles are nice details.
