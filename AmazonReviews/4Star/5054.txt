This is a great set of LEDs. This was my first time installing anything of this sort, so I went into it a bit blind, however I have extensive knowledge with electronics. First impressions were that for the price point, the strip seems well constructed and came well packaged.. great first impression!<br /><br />Installation was very easy.. I installed these under my new bed frame for a bit of ambient lighting. The only negative, hence the 4 stars, would be the 3M Backing. It works great for holding the LEDs, but don't expect it to hold ANY other weight. The white control box was pulling the strip down just a bit, and the backing couldn't hold it at all. Very minor issue, but could be improved. I would also of liked the remote receiver to be a bit longer of a cord.<br /><br />Overall, these are great, and I will be buying more.
