Nice, sturdy case. Fits my son's guitar well and has room to tuck supplies away. Only complaint is that the &#34;lock&#34; doesn't seem to do much, although as I'm thinking about it, maybe the key has to keep spinning after it latches before you can remove it? Not sure as my son took the case to college so I can't fiddle with it.
