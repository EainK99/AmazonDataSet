Overall very good sound quality.  The Bluetooth works well.  My iPhone 6 burns through battery when using Bluetooth, so if I am going to be using it for more than 30-40 minutes, I keep it plugged into the USB port so the batter keeps charged.  The battery on the Tailgater has not fully discharged yet, so I can't judge the actual time from full charge to zero, but based on the meter, I don't think it will be 50 hours as stated in the manual.  Has met all my needs so far.
