I did enjoy my purchase of the launchpad, the first reason I bought it is cuz of the<br />ipad application, it resulted much more fun to use with the controller than in the ipad<br />screen.<br /><br />There were a few things that I feel that are missing:<br />- The ipad app although I like it, still a long way to go, you cannot load your samples and I need to dig weather you<br />  can export or not, as it is not obvious in the menu.  But I hope it does.<br /><br />As far as the controller, it is light, it is portable, the Ipad is able to USB power it, so the energy it uses is very little,<br />but the ipad has this issue where you cannot charge it while using the camera connection kit and I dont really like that, but<br />that is an ipad flaw, I havent tried it with ableton, but I can see definitely that I would be missing a few knobs. seems it is only<br />made for triggering the clips exclusively, but I cannot feel strongly opinionated, I would need to try it first, so this part is very subjective.  For being a plastic controller, only buttons no knobs it is fun to use, but I wish for the price it were wireless,<br />the camera connection kit is not the strongest feature of an ipad and it is pretty anoying to have the cable pulling and in the middle.
