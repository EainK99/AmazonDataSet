Please note, for the two weeks I've had this case, my opinion primarily is this case is excellent in quality, style, instrument protection for a soft case and it's difficult not to love it. I even kept it although it wasn't my first choice but showed up as a present from my dear wife, and exchanging it for the Mono was my first inclination.<br /><br />Storage compartments are high on my feature list and the Mono (not top loader) seems to have that. This RB Continental does have several pockets, including a few very large ones in the front area on the body but unless you're storing paper, the pockets feel too tight. I'm even concerned about my little Snark clip on tuners that the plastic may break. I tried putting my fairly small Dell 4200 laptop in the laptop pocket but feared the pressure on the screen may cause a break.<br /><br />There is also a large neatly tucked away zippered compartment on the back of the case along the neck. This is a cool pocket even though it's also too tight for anything delicate but it does hold all my tools and batteries including a fairly long truss rod wrench. For those who don't like the high ride using the backpack straps which I don't like either, I adjust the straps out to max size. For me the position of the case is now on my back at an acceptable level.<br /><br />To make this case work for me I installed an internal compartment inside under the headstock for the delicate things and I am now totally satisfied with this case.<br /><br />By the way, I think my lanky 10 lbs. Thumb Bass would not fare as well as the 6 lbs Strat that RB threw off the building in their website video, but that's just a guess.
