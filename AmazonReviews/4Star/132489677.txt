easy to use.  Can use as a bluetooth or Aux ... also has a USB plug where you can hitch a plug to for charging the phone.  I bought 2 ... but the iPhone can only connect to one at a time.  Therefore, when using it I have to tell my phone to forget the pairing then connect it to the other one.  That is my only 'complaint'
