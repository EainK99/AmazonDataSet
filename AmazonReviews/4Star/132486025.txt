I hadn't heard of the Rapco Horizon brand but checking out their website while researching what speaker cable to buy made me pretty confident I wanted to buy from them - they have a huge array of products, and they place emphasis on construction and utility rather than trying to make their equipment look slick and jacking up the price like other brands. This cable works great for me and I'll definitely buy more stuff from Rapco Horizon in the future.
