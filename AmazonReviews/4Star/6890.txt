First time with a Melodica, and it's a lot of fun!<br /><br />It's light and the sound isn't as annoying as some of the other reviews say. I actually like the sound a lot, although I'm writing this before the keys apparently go out of tune. so we'll see.<br /><br />My gripes are that even with the tube attachment it's too short to place in your lap, and if you use one hand to hold it, then you have to grip it with your teeth, which can hurt after a while.<br /><br />Overall, it's definitely worth the price, but for me it isn't a five star item.
