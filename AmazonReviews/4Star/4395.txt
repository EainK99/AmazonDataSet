Let me say up front that I just received this, and can only offer my first impressions. This came in a molded plastic case, a plus in my book. The mic is heavy and feels solid.  The cable appears to be of decent quality.  I tried this out with my Behringer acoustic amp and the sound quality is quite good. I haven't done any recording with it yet, but I believe it will be fine. For a musician on a budget a decent quality mic at this price is a real find- the included cable is just icing on the cake. If any problems occur I'll update my review, but as of now I am happy with this purchase.
