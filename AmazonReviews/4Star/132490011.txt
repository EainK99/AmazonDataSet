Love these for blues. Thick, dark, full of tone. I mostly play the neck pickup for blues, and this thing has enough  power and presence to keep these chunky and warm.<br />Only negative - the bridge pickup is not clear enough for a good tele country twang. I'm going to try change the pots to get them brighter.
