Honestly I believe this device is awesome!  I would love to give it 5 stars but honestly the fact that it comes with Pro-Tools and the hell it put me through...  yea not so much fun.<br /><br />I am still playing with it to try to figure out how to get the most out of it but honestly so far it does what it was meant to do.  the speed is there it's just pro-tools that is what sucks.<br /><br />I purchased this to go with Music Creator 6 Touch (Steam purchase) only to find out that MC6T only allows 2 inputs at a time!  I still honestly may contact Steam and the BBB about that as NOWHERE in the documentation on the page to purchase discusses the number of inputs...  oh it says 16 tracks but NOTHING about (at 2 at a time MAX).  Apparently they want you to jump up to more expensive packages.<br /><br />So because of that I went ahead and decided &#34;why not&#34; and installed the Pro-Tools included in the package...  One and a half hours later I was able to plug in and record.  About 10 minutes after that I found out that the Pro-Tools bundled with this doesn't even export to MP3 without purchasing more software.  So be prepared to run through a very convoluted DRM (via USB Dongle and associated websites and software) scheme in order to get the software even running and then after that another 20 minutes or so getting the lame-mp3 encoder installed and working.<br /><br />Now my whole reason for buying this was that I wanted to do a little recording here and there but have the option to also record multiple vocals at the same time (this being a 4x4 input device).  So after getting Pro-Tools installed and recording something I decided to listed to what I recorded...  CAN'T.  Apparently this is because Pro-Tools only will output back to this device as OUTGOING AUDIO.  So even if you have normal PC speakers/headphones good luck.  You cannot even plug in headphone cables to this on the &#34;headphone monitoring&#34; ports.  Pro-Tools will only send to the Monitor OUTs on the back of the unit.<br /><br />So honestly I am off to find some software that will do 4 in as well as just let me listed to the playback in my normal headphones/speakers (I am not looking to setup a professional studio).<br /><br />Lastly the build on this is just great!  Everything is labeled well and it is straight forward to understand.  My only complaint with this unit itself is similar to what others have said...  CABLE PORTS SHOULD BE ON THE BACK OF THE UNIT NOT THE FRONT!  At first I didn't realize how much of a hassle it is but then after rigging everything up... yea real easy to understand how annoying real quick.  If you are getting this for long term usage... build yourself a little stand to run the cords down & under to head out the back...  you will be thankful you did.
