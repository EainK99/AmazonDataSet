I have had the original version of the Chordmaster (the one with the touch screen) for some time, but it recently stopped working.  I was able to find the original one online, but decided to go with the redesigned Chordmaster 2.<br />Now that I have tried the new unit, I can say that I prefer the older model.  The touch screen was more convenient to use.<br /><br />Some of the reviews I read on this product faulted the tuner.  Mine seems to work just fine, but I doubt that I will be using it as I have a tuner in my floor rig.<br /><br />There is another (newer?) version of this unit which I also ordered.  The other one is thinner, cost more, is black in color (rather than silver), does not have the metronome or tuner and uses those coin shaped batteries.  I prefer the silver model as the display is slightly bigger and it uses regular AAA batteries.<br /><br />This is a good quick refence for chords that you can keep right in your case.  I recommend it.
