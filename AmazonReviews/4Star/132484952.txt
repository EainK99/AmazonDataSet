[[ASIN:B00DN2BHWC Cotton Guitar Strap - Classic Black - Strong, Soft, Non-Slip Weave (Not Cheap Nylon) for Acoustic and Electric - Fits All Sizes - 2\\" Wide, Adjusts to 56\\" - Play Standing Up And Improve Performance - Extended Leather Ends - No Logo - 100% Guaranteed!]]I bought this as a gift for my brother. He plays an acoustic and I thought he'd be too cheap to buy a good strap. He likes the sturdy feel of the cotton material and says it doesn't slip or slide when moving.<br /><br />I also decided to buy the guitar button holder for a few more bucks to avoid using the silly little string tie on a nice instrument. Of course, he likes this little gizmo better than the black strap. Go figure.<br /><br />Not a bad combo for the overall price.
