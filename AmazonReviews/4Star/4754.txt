Bought these at wallmart for $3.50.  Since I managed to avoid ripping apart these headphones like some monkey ....  I'll provide a real review of the actual product..  :)<br /><br />They're built fine. I found no way to hurt myself on them.  I haven't broken mine.<br /><br />Sound:  I listen with Spotify in extream (320kbps-ish) with Viper4Android.  I found them surprisingly good once I found the right settings on the EQ.  Good enough to look them up on amazon to see how much they were, Incase I needed to go back to wallmart and buy them all to resell them to monkeys who break theirs the moment it leaves the package.  Almost tempting, but their quite heap here too.  The sound is exactly as the side of the box knobs shows.  Okay bass, okay mids, better highs, and some kind of FX1 which is nonsense to me.  But with the settings right bass is great, mids are decent, highs are still good.<br /><br />Anyway.  Open yours carefully. Hopefully you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was.
