[[ASIN:B00CE0VMEW Electro-Voice ZLX-15 15\\" 2-Way Passive Loudspeaker]]I could not find a review on these passive speakers only on the powered ones. This was an upgrade to my peavey pr15 which I loved, but it was time to move on with a more streamline speakers and power.So based on the people I spoke to from different places and reviewing the specs, I chose this pair and it is loud, worth the money and almost as powerful as my yamaha clubs, in my opinion just need to eq them correctly to enjoy it more.(my mixer is kind of old)<br /> did a wedding with these and it was great.Love the handles and how easy and light to carry.
