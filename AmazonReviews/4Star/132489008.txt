...with a lot of options, tonally-speaking. Lacks the fizzy &#34;edge&#34; that many emulators have. I use this for my cover band's live shows, as we use all direct instruments for a lower level of stage sound, and it's close enough to a mic'd speaker - including &#34;feeling reactive&#34; - to get the job done at a low volume.<br /><br />The downside is that it's for line-level only, something that isn't abundantly clear until you actually read the manual. There's a version coming out (the GCS-3) that will accept power amp inputs, though.
