I wanted to see if i would like playing the ukulele but didn't want to spend a ton of money on it, only to find out i didn't like it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sounds Great<br />-Great Value<br />-Decent Craftsmanship<br /><br />Cons<br />-Doesn't stay tuned requires frequent re-tuning<br /><br />All in all this is a great Ukulele and would highly recommend it to anyone considering starting to play the ukulele.
