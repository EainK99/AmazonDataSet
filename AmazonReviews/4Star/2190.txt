I have relied on the Snark tuners for years because they are reliable and inexpensive enough where I can keep one in each instrument's case. However, the notion of polytuning sparked my curiosity, and I found this device helpful. It has a couple of problems. Sometimes, when I strum all the strings, not all of them appear on the display. It also often happens that after individually tuning each string, I notice that strumming suggests that a couple of strings may be instantly out of tune again. For the most part, however, I have found tuning much easier and quicker with this device than with the Snark tuners. Also, although it is meant for six-string guitars, I found it an accurate tuner for my twelve-string guitar and mandolin, although the polytune function, of course, does not work for those.
