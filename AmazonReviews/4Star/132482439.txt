Really, this pedal is fantastic.  It allows you to manage most of the VYPYR amp's capabilities from your feet, without having to walk over to the amp to change things up.  You can get to all of your presets from the pedal, though there are a few flaws in my opinion:<br /><br />-You can't change between the distortion, heavy distortion, and clean settings within an amp bank.  This means that in order to change between distortion and clean, you have to change between banks, and unfortunately, there is a brief pause while the VYPYR changes over.  This isn't so bad for sitting at home, writing songs, but it is terrible for anything quick and on-the-go.<br /><br />-You can only alter your delay and reverb within a preset if it is already present in the setting.  So, you have to add reverb and delay to a preset if you ever want even the possibility of using it within that preset.<br /><br />-The left-hand pedal (by default) controls the overall volume.  It seems a little finicky at first; other than muting the sound, you'll probably never bring the pedal down more than halfway.  If you ever use the looper pedal, though, you'll HAVE to use the volume pedal, as the looper volume gets set at the same level as what you'll be playing over it.  So, you'll want to keep the pedal at about 3/4 open, record your loop, then open the volume pedal all the way to jam alongside your own recording.<br /><br />-The right-hand pedal (by default) controls the wah.  That's all it does.  You can switch it with the left-hand pedal if you'd like, but otherwise, that's it.<br /><br />I guess what I'd really like out of the Sanpera is the ability to actually set what the pedals and buttons do.  For instance, it would be nice to have a button to control the looper recording, while using the right-hand pedal to control the loop's volume.  Or maybe, to change say, the (bizarrely placed, rather useless) tempo button's function to controlling the amp preset's distortion setting.  But then, I should've known when I bought this amp/pedal combo that I was buying into the idea of a prepackaged effects amp.<br /><br />All in all, if you bought the VYPYR, there is no reason why you shouldn't get this pedal.  I know my list of complaints are longer than the benefits I've given, but functionally, this pedal completes the VYPYR package.known when I bought this amp/pedal combo that I was buying into the idea of a prepackaged effects amp.<br /><br />All in all, if you bought the VYPYR, there is no reason why you shouldn't get this pedal.
