It's a good bag and the padding is adequate for everyday use--probably not the sort of thing you'd want for heavy use or travel.  It's just about the only gig bag we've found that fits an acoustic bass.  Be warned--don't load up the pocket with heavy stuff like ring binders or pedals--we're on the second of these bags now because my husband did just that with the first. Adding a second luggage strap (we cannibalized the one from the broken bag) makes it backpackable and less prone to get stuck in doorways.  Turn the hooks away from your body so they don't get pressed open and cause a strap to come off while you're wearing it.
