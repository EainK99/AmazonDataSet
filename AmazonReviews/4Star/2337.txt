I am just getting back into collecting vinyl and needed a good entry level turntable. I ordered this based on reviews and I have not been disappointed! There aren't any bells and whistles but I just wanted something that sounds decent that wasn't going to break the bank. I ordered a cork pad to replace the felt pad that came with it because the felt does not lay flat. Other than that I have to complaints. If you are a serious audiophile then stay away from this, I'm sure you would be disappointed, but if you are a serious audiophile then I'm sure wouldn't be looking at a $100 turntable.
