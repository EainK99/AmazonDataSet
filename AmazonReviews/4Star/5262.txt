This stand was precisely what I was looking for - an economical way to declutter my home music space - and my stage footprint when I play live. Right now, I have five instruments on it - one acoustic guitar (standard size), two electrics (both Les Paul-ish LTDs, though one is distinctly thicker than the other), one 4-string bass, and one 5-string Thunderbird. This combination packs the stand very tight, and the long-scale T-bird takes a bit of care to situate without the headstock bumping into the wall. All the guitars sit close enough that I wouldn't slide one in haphazardly for fear of dinging it against the others, but I never toss my guitars around like that anyway. The dividers at the bottom are a really nice touch and help keep things organized in place. On stage, I'll only be using it for the 3 guitars, and I think that should work very nicely. The folding feature is easy and useful.<br /><br />Assembly was simple but a bit deceptive. The instructions aren't great. I'm no stranger to assembly-required stuff, but I had to reassemble the bottom of the stand because I realized too late I had the cross bar for the bottom dividers on backwards. Wasn't a big deal to fix, but my first assembly had sat perfectly flat on the floor. After changing that bar around, I couldn't quite get it back to flush. Sitting on my carpet, it's not noticeable, but on hardwood and concrete there will be just a bit of lift from one foot.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite pleased with this stand. I haven't had it long or road-tested it yet, though, so I can't attest to its durability.
