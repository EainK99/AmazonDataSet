As a beginner, this was my first ukulele and I must say I think it is a pretty good value (I now own another soprano and a tenor).  Though I read a few other reviews citing tuning issues, I found this one stays in tune pretty well after the first week or so - you just have to give the strings time to stretch and note that the recommended &#34;gut&#34; strings take even longer (but sound a bit richer).  Plus, the design fits my style.  Given the price, I'd say if you like the style, its worth adding to your collection.  Lastly, its pretty durable and travels well!
