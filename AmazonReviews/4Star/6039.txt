While it doesn't blast your own voice into your ear it's the same as using your hand to cup your ear to your mouth or maybe a tad louder. This is great for singers who can't  use their hands because their occupied playing an instrument. You're not going to get IEM volumes with this though. Good for rehearsal but I wouldn't ever use it live because it just looks plain odd on the stage. The first time I brought it to rehearsal our bassist thought it was some type of spit guard. lol.
