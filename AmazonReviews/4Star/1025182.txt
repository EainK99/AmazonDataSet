I really like this tuner. It's sturdy and well made. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the off and on button. Both me and the other guitarist I play with have big hands and the little off/on button on the side is very small and not as easy to grab as the Snarks so either of us like using them live. The Snarks have a nice big button on the front which we both really like. If you don't mind leaving the tuner on during a performance or have small or nimble hands this is an outstanding tuner.
