I guess maybe I'm not that critical...but several years ago I mounted a pair of these to a cupboard in my kitchen. I connect up an iPhone, iPod, or laptop to them and they sound just fine. I stream Pandora or one of my playlists. No complaints, no issues. Have held up well over time. I think when I bought them people must have felt more positive about them.
