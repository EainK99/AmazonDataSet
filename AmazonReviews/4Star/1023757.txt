This is a nice piece of gear. Its lightweight plastic construction was off-putting at first, but when I heard the clean, clear audio it delivered, that disappointment quickly faded. There's plenty of gain available for even the least sensitive dynamic microphones, and it provides phantom power for condenser mics.<br /><br />The &#34;sensing&#34; circuit that determines whether phantom power is needed apparently works by sensing source impedance, and my only complaint is that it's a little unreliable. Some Røde condensers seem to look like dynamic mics and it won't power them. I wish there were an on/off/auto switch for phantom power.
