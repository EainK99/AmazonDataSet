I do not use this for performances but to connect my guitar to my XBOX360 to play Rocksmith.  The game can pick up the guitar perfectly and I can play with very little issue.  Occasionally it will have a hiccup with note recognition but it is far and few between.  It is affordable and does not job great.  As a side note, my son also uses it to connect to his Mac and like it as well.  We have not though used it in an amplification situation so I cannot comment on that.
