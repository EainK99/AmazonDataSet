This matched the exact size, shape and look of my previous knobs. The problem is that it was newer/shinier than my 20 year old knobs, So it definitely looked different than the others because it was brighter and shinier. I guess this could be expected and I do not subtract points for looking newer than something 20 years old. I literally scratched it up on purpose to make it match the other ones better. That didn't really help. Maybe they should sell &#34;vintage&#34; ones like they sell &#34;vintage&#34; new jeans. I would recommend just paying a few extra bucks and buying a pack of 10-15 and just replacing all your knobs. These look great new .
