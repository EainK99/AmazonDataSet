Ok, i've had the ath-m50 for over a week now and my experience using it so far has been mostly positive.<br /><br />Sound Quality: 4.5/5<br />Mids, highs, and lows are all crystal clear. There is enough bass to satisfy just about anyone, while still maintaining detail. Don't believe people who say that these headphones are lacking bass. Depending on the music, it can feel like your ears are being slammed with bass. The only negative is that mids may seem a little recessed, but that may just be due to personal taste. An amp can help to bring the mids forward. These headphones are also good at isolating sound. Anyone else in the room will not be able to hear anything, unless they literally an inch away from you. It is not noise canceling however.<br /><br />Comfort: 3.5/5<br />The ear pads are soft; but due to the non-breathable material, can make your ears hot and sweaty if worn longer than 30 minutes or so. The top of the headband can cause a pressure point on the top of your head. Due to the bulk of the cable, it works better for stationary, rather than portable use.<br /><br />Overall these headphones produce exceptional sound quality at a very competitive price, held back by a few comfort issues.
