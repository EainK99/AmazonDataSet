Been using these for some time as they are reasonably priced and work well.  They don't maintain their 'fresh out of the box' tone as long as other strings I've used, but they do tend to be a lot more durable.  11s are the smallest gauge I can use without breaking strings, and even then I break occasionally other brands.<br /><br />These are great for bending and do a commendable job staying in tune, even after months and months on a single guitar.  I only change strings on a guitar when I need to do setup work, clean the guitar, or a string breaks so the longevity of these strings is pretty cool.
