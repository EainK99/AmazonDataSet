Bought this to record a radio show that comes on overnight and to record LPs that have never made it to CDs. Hook it to my computers headphone jack with a 1/8\\" male to 1/8\\" male patch cable. Recording is very clean. Lets you pick the MP3 rate to control the file size. Even with batteries when the unit is hooked to the computer with the USB cable it lets you choose how you want to power it on startup. Simple to operate, comes with a 2 GB card that will record for hours depending on your settings. Mine came with earbuds and a lot of people complained about them being mono unless you hold a switch. Mine had no switch, are stereo and sound great.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is I wish you could set a predetermined amount of time to record then have it automatically stop recording. Hopefully somebody at Tascam will see this and have it in the next firmware update.
