This little controller is pretty good! I needed something portable so I could write anywhere. The keys seems a bit stiff but I'm sure they just need to be broken in.  It connected to my MBP 13-inch 2012 model with no issues.  No drivers needed.  Has a sustain pedal input. Feels sturdy.  Definitely great for the price.
