I've always trusted big name brands and have had plenty of success with Amazon and the merchants using Amazon as a sales vehicle.  Well all works well when all is going fine.  The instrument I purchased new was defective.  Middle C note failed immediately and made the keyboard useless.  Many attempts to get this rectified failed due to lack of communication to the merchant and Amazon.  The true customer confidence is based upon getting a resolution when things go wrong.  Amazon failed and so did the merchant using the Amazon sales avenue.  Eventually they engaged personally via a telephone call and the problem was satisfactorily resolved.  The confusion existed with multiple replies from sources that weren't communicating with each other and coordinating their replies.<br /><br />Amazon customer service basically told me to go pound sand and contact Yamaha warranty department as if their responsibility ended with their receiving my money for a defective product.  They were totally irresponsible and insulting in their responses to my request for assistance.  The merchant aSavings solved the problem once I was able to contact them directly and reached an individual, Anthony who engaged in solving my problem.  He ended up advising me to return the item and trusting them to send a new keyboard.  Thank goodness I had saved the box and packaging.  I received a new keyboard which works fine.  I found aSavings to be reputable and responsive once I was able to engage with an individual representative from the company.<br /><br />Advice: Don't expect any support from Amazon unless you have a back-up protection via a credit card company.  NEVER use Pay Pal!  Save the original box and packaging.  Get merchant contact information prior to purchase.
