Fantastic little synth!<br />The first synth I ever owned the was the Korg Monotribe. I quickly purchased the Volca line( excluding the sampler).<br />So far, I favor the Volca Keys, the Volca Bass being the least favorite ( still, all synths a great).<br /><br />I wont really review the sounds of the synth, as I am not a professional. I will say the snare is a bit weak, with the bass drum being the best part.<br /><br />The build quality is pretty ok, its made out of  plastic, but seems strong.. Without the batteries, the unit feels light, and cheap. The keys are responsive and sensitive ( not velocity)as the lightest touch seems to enable them.
