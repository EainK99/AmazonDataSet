Disclaimer: I'm not a sound specialist or a professional, so I can only give you my lay opinion on this mic.<br /><br />I bought this mic primarily to do voice-overs for my online Thai language courses (learnthaionline). Despite sound-proofing one of the rooms in my house, I was still picking up the noises of dogs barking, birds chirping, cocks crowing, frogs croaking and motorbikes revving outside. So I looked for a cardioid mic and this seemed to be the most versatile one. I considered a larger mic that rests on a stand (and which may be better quality, I don't know) but at least I can use this mic for interviews or other outdoors work. Still, I was a bit concerned that the smallness of the device might not give me as good a sound as a proper \\"voice\\" microphone.<br /><br />Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how very clear the pick-up was - and how well it eliminated the sounds from outside - so long as I pointed the mic inwards, with the back of the mic facing the outside wall. It does still pick up sound from the sides, it has a kind of 180-degree pick-up pattern (maybe tapering off slightly at the extreme circumference), so one has to be careful to point the mic correctly. I'm not sure it would work so well as a lavalier mic because of this: it'll pick up the vocal signal very clearly, but because the head of the mic is facing upwards, underneath the talent's chin, it will also pick up sounds from all around, i.e. the talent's chest (which isn't usually a problem) and any sounds coming from his/her front. I ended up attaching the mic to a thin rod to make a kind of inverted L, so that it faced the talent's face directly, pointing to his/her chin. I used the windshield which came with the kit and I didn't pick up any wind noise from the speaker at all.<br /><br />Now, there is something you need to be aware of and I lopped off one star because of this, perhaps unfairly because this problem may only apply when recording to a non-professional (non-balanced) device. I use an [[ASIN:B000OSDLEK Olympus DS-50 Digital Voice Recorder]], which has a mini-jack input. So I had to get an adapter for the XLR output of the microphone. I bought two different ones, because I couldn't figure out how to do this effectively.<br /><br />These gadgets are more important than they at first appear. I thought any old adapter would do, but how you connect up your mic to the recorder changes the character of the sound significantly! Ametron supplied me with the Sennheiser CM1, which normally retails for $60 - but he sold it to me for $40 (the \\"street\\" price). I also bought the [[ASIN:B00EHTIHA0 Kopul LMT100 - Low to High Impedance Matching Transformer (1.5')]] for $25 from B&H Video. I thought to use the Sennheiser for my wireless transmitter and perhaps the Kopul for my \\"consumer\\" DVR device.<br /><br />The sound recording seems quite exceptional and there was virtually no pick-up of the outside noises at all. The sound is very pure. However, there's quite a loud - or at least very noticeable - inherent noise being recorded and I'm not sure where it's coming from.<br /><br />With the Kopul XLR-mini-jack adapter, I get a low white noise similar to the sound of a soft breeze blowing continuously on the mic. The voice sound recorded from the microphone seems to be fairly mellow and with a nice intimate sound, as if the bass has been boosted and the volume increased slightly. Maybe the \\"electronics\\" inside the adapter (resistors and capacitors, perhaps?) generate this underlying noise and alter the timbre of the voice signal.<br /><br />When I use the Sennheiser adapter, however, the \\"floor\\" noise seems to be a lot lower (or the frequency of the noise is higher, it's hard to tell) but there is sometimes an intermittent electrical crackling sound.<br /><br />The sound character is also remarkably different - not so mellow, a sharper, cleaner sound as though the low bass frequencies have been cut out completely. And the volume is slightly softer. (Thismay explain why the background noise seems different or lower.)<br /><br />However, as these noises are usually very consistent (except for the crackling sounds, and I'm not sure whether they occur every time I record something), I can use audacity to capture the noise profile of a \\"silent\\" part of the recording and then remove the noise. It does so very cleanly and I don't think the recording signal (of the voice) is seriously affected. I usually have to play a bit with equalization to add (or remove) the mellowness to the quality of the voice to make it sound a bit more (or less) intimate.<br /><br />So as a voice-recording mic, this is probably the best out of the range of very good entry-level \\"pro\\" mics. My [[ASIN:B004UNQ4US Sennheiser ME2]] lavalier mic costs only around $140 and is pretty good also, so long as there is NO ambient noise, and you fiddle about with the noise filtering and equalization settings quite aggressively.<br /><br />This (Sony ECM-66B) mic is three times the price (when you factor in the adapter) but I'm glad I have it. For my purposes, I can get a beautiful, clean and intimate sound - just like being in the same room as the speaker). I'd have to spend thousands of dollars to get anything better; and I suspect the main difference between this mic and a studio-quality radio broadcast mic might be the noise handling. Very likely, my next step would be to get a balanced recording device, which may then eliminate any \\"floor\\" noise completely. If anyone can advise on this then please add your comment below.<br /><br />Ametron's price is remarkably low for this mic and his customer service was excellent. I would buy from him again in the future.
