My expectations of this kit were pretty low.  I was looking for an inexpensive kit to use for practice.  So I figured I would take a shot on this one.  I am glad I did!!  Just understand that this is not an expensive kit and you won't be disappointed.  The hardware is not very high quality but is gets the job done.  The lugs stay in tune.  The heads that come with the kit are absolute garbage.  don't waste your time putting them on the kit.  go ahead and order you a good set of quality heads when you order this kit.  These heads work ok for bottom heads but thats it.  The Snare drum actually sounds very good!!  I was very surprised by that.  I did play a few live shows wit this kit and it did wonderful but I wouldn't recommend giging with this on a regular basis.  It just wont hold up to that kind of abuse I don't think.  This kit is best kept at the practice spot and not moved around a lot.  It would be a great starter kit for the new drummer!!
