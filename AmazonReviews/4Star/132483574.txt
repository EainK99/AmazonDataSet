My Carvin bass enables me to pull a knob and feed the output of the pickups directly to the output (bypassing the guitar's internal preamp).  This is the way I am using the Hartke Pedal.<br /><br />I was able to find settings that gave my bass more character.  The difference is enough that I feel it is worth the $99.  The pedal adds a small amount of noise (hiss) especially when some of the knobs are turned up.<br /><br />I subtracted 1.5 stars for the following reasons:<br />(1) It contains no power supply.<br />(2) There is no volume knob that allows a person to equalize volume for pedal buttons.  This is a significant design flaw in my opinion.<br />(3) Hartke support did not reply to my email.
