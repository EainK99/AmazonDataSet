Great starter projector light. Only reason I did not give five stars is the lack of options and directions that did not arrive with the light. And while it looks great, I don't  necessarily want them or spell out 'Welcome' every time I use it. If anyone has instructions, feel free to correct me or send a link.<br /><br />We also want to note the primary mount is quite flimsy, so be careful when handling.
