At first we were disappointed with the microphone.  It produced a lot of loud static when using the mic to Skype.  After changing the setting on the side of the mic, the static disappeared and now it works great!  The middle setting on the side button is where we found success.  The directions could be more clear.  Overall, a great little mic!
