My daughter (6) wanted a guitar for her birthday, and this was the perfect size and price point.  It's not a professional grade guitar, but will do the trick for a year or two until she grows into a guitar she won't destroy ;-)  Its lightweight enough for her to carry and &#34;rock-out&#34; to, and sturdy enough to withstand being dropped.  Tuning is a bit of a pain, we bought extra strings, just in case.
