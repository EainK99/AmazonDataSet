It does feel cheap, I'm used to a 3-5pound direct box not a 0.5-1.5pound direct box. It does its job well, no hissing or humming nouse the lift switch works like a charm. Even took the time to see the construction inside and it looks good inside, maybe its just me. Again im used to a 3-5pounder not a 0.5-1.5pounder. But other than that its great!!
