I am delighted with the large screen which lights up completely red or green.  I am legally blind, and I can easily see it ; with the Korg I was using, I had to bring the tuner close to my eyes to make out the tiny lights.  I did replace the pickup cord with one which has an alligator clip which I can fasten on a tuning pin instead of on the soundboard of my harp.  I find that gives my a more accurate reading.
