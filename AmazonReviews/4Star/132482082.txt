As others have said, it's a decent little stand as long as your mic<br />stand or whatever you're mounting it to is exactly the right size.<br />For a standard mic stand, it's spot on.  but anything else and it<br />either won't fit or won't tighten up.  In my case, it goes on a lighting<br />stand to hold some accessories - it works, but has to go on a higher<br />extension on the stand than I wanted.  I can live with it.<br /><br />But outside of it's very rigid idea of what size pole it can go on, it's<br />an otherwise fine stand at a good price.
