I found a review of this pack on YouTube and when I saw the massive savings on Amazon, didn't hesitate to make the purchase. A few extra things to help you make up your mind:<br />Metal construction... these lights look and feel expensive.<br />The cables have additional screw type fasteners to keep them in place.<br />The master units packaging is marked. I like that...<br />They look soooo good with fog!<br />I give them four stars for two reasons:<br />1. A little light escapes through the seams in the housing (nothing some sneaky tape can't handle)<br />2. If you're a crazy person and like to take care of your stuff, the styrofoam packing could be better suited for that.
