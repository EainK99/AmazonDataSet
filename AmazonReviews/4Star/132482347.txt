My husband needed a gig bag for his Nord keyboard and asked me to order this for him.  He was concerned that this wasn't an authentic Nord bag since the logo wasn't pictured.  It arrived earlier than stated and he was thrilled to find a Nord logo on the bag.  He is happy with the purchase but mentioned that the fit was very snug and hopes that it'll stretch out in time.
