Although the shipping took much longer than the two day prime (try a week), the instrument itself is great! I bought it for my son who is in his second school year playing the cello and it is perfect for him. We had to take it to our local music shop to have the bridge and strings put into place, but it only took 10 or so minutes and they didn't charge us. The strings are a little lose at the top, son's teacher says it will take awhile for them to stiffen up and that it was pretty standard for a new cello - she deemed it a great value overall.
