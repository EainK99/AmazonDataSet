I love this stand, and I only wish it came in a bigger size for larger laptops. It still holds my 17.3&#34; laptop well, but I'd love to see a three-legged version that could carry a big desktop replacement laptop without any part of the laptop sticking over the edge.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this stand can squeak very loudly when you are unfolding or folding it up; replacing the metal-on-metal contacts with some ball-bearing hinges might go a long way to fixing this.
