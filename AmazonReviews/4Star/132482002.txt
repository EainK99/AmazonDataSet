First off, I bought mine because I have never had a violin and I thought itd be great, and(i got it at a pawn shop for $86) and it was basically in BRAND NEW condition and the wood on it has no scratches on it and it plays so beautifully, I'll probably be playing this one til i get the money to be ripped off with a $10,000.00 one but the quality of the instrument is great for the price and it plays great:)
