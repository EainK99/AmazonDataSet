We are using these at our church. small room. Sits about 175 people. Still figuring out how to stop the feed back and out of the 4 we purchased One unit keeps intermittently dropping the signal causing some interference. The body of the microphone is very sensitive too. When you handle them you hear it coming through the system. Over all. I believe this to be a quality product. I can walk around the whole building and use the microphone. I think most of our issues are still learning our new sound system. For the price. I'd buy more.
