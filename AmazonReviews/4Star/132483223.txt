The form factor of this thing is just amazing: Super light but it doesn't feel super cheap.<br />Very small, it's a joy to look at and use. I like the sound quality very much. I guess my only complain would be that one of the pots got noisy after very little use.<br /><br />Under certain switch configuration/setup you will saturate the mixer to the point it shuts itself down with an unpleasant fart-like sound. I wish they considered protection for such scenario and prevent the shutdown which is pretty annoying because it forces you to cycle power. This happens only when you flip the wrong switch at the wrong time: read the manual so you know what the switches are for.<br /><br />These design mistakes can be improved, but overall I love it and I would definitely recommend it.
