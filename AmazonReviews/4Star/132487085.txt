The sound activation is driven by bass, so it probably won't work with a small radio, but anything with a subwoofer will work.  To get the full effect, you should use it with a haze machine or fog machine otherwise it is just spinning color dots.  Only compliant: the motor is a bit noisy when the unit is used in a smaller room (bedroom size) but is easily masked when in a larger setting.
