At first I felt a bit customer driven ripped off to spend a few bucks on a cut out piece of metal.<br />These cant cost more than pennies to make.<br /><br />However if you are looking to isolate your frets on your guitar to hit it with some polishing material, this does the job<br />so that you fret board doesnt get hit as well.<br /><br />I used it to polish my frets with 0000 steel wool, came out very nice with no micro scratches to the rosewood.
