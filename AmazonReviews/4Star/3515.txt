Phase out you old clamps. These are the best! I really prefer these. Too bad I need so many of them. The only issue I have is that they do not stay on the pipe just by gravity. You have to get that screw in place. It is not hard, but it takes two hands. The best part is that this will not crush a hanging pipe.
