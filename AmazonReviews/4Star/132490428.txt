It looks great.  I got this for my grandson's fifth birthday and he loved it.  It is a real guitar and playable could be much better with a little work on the bridge etc.  The strings were not good at all almost impossible to tune. I took the strings off and replaced them with as set of old nylon strings I had lying around. The electronic tuner is wonderful.  The most precious thing is how reverently my little guy handles the guitar. He thinks it cost me a million dollars.
