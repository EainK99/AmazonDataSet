Doesn't really seem to improve tuning stability for me. Perhaps I'm restringing my guitar wrongly. But they sure make it A LOT easier and faster to replace the strings since you don't have to do a lot of winding.<br /><br />However ensure your guitar is able to fit these before purchase. I had to drill 2 holes per tuning head on my MIJ standard Strat. Not a big deal, but I thought I should point it out to any potential buyer.
