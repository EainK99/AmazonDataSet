Our daughter plays the sax.  She is currently playing a cheap horn that came with a beat up case that fell apart.  I didn't want to spend more on a case than the sax is worth, so I bought this one.  It works, it's much lighter than her old case, but it's no hard side case.  She is careful with the horn, but I can't say that's true of her fellow band members.  Last spring a kid threw his horn right on top of her sax in this case and now it's busted beyond repair.  This case is great for short term carrying but it's not terribly protective.
