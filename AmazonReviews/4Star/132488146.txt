Basically a deadcat for lav mics. They are a perfect fit for my Sennheiser ME-2 lavs. They seem to be sized with this particular mic in mind. However, they are not too big, and not too small. So will fit most lav mics.<br /><br />Also, the most important part. They cut down on wind noise significantly compared to a bare mic, but don't expect complete elimination. Just enough for quality sound with some background.
