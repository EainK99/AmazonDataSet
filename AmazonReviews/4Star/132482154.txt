Ok plugged my Tele with bigsby in and it sounds amazing. Theres a switch that goes normal, bright and warm. Warm is perfect for those who might use it as a rhythm crunch tone. The normal is a good place to start to learn how the controls interact. Its a got a good even response. The bright is the best part. Its such a boost to the upper frequencies that a low gain and high volume setting (tone just above or below half way depending on taste) that it's the ideal clean boost in this setting. I highly recommend this and I'm a huge gear and pedal guy.<br /><br />May I use this moment to list a few I have just to establish credentials? 2 Ross Orange Phasers (78 and 79) 1989 Boss BF2 Flanger (Japanese version) and 1991 USA BF2 as Maxon OD808 ProCo Rat II and others. I've spent hundreds on pedals and pennies on cheap ones I thought might be cool. I have the Biyang Baby Boom compressor pedal and I love it.<br /><br />Try one, they sound great. I gave it 4 stars because I have yet to feel out how long the battery lasts and I doubt it lasts more than maybe 6-8 hours.
