I took a chance and ordered this for my J-Bass. For anyone considering that I can confirm it's a good fit. Not an expensive item but seems adequate for occasional use and so far appears to be a pretty good deal. I got it from another site and with accrued bonus points my cost was $13 delivered.<br /><br />Mfg Part#: 940-XBGIG
