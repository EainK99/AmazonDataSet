The only complaint I have about this case, which isn't a big deal to me, is that if you use the case vary often, you will rip the padding out of the bottom of the case because it fits so snug. I mean that complaint is like saying... &#34;It does it job too well&#34; I would still pick this case up if I used it often and just find a way to alleviate the pressure off of that point.
