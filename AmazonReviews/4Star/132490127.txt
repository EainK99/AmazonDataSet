Had been researching the larger version of this product since seeing at my local Costco.  I was shopping at Kohls this weekend and saw the Road Rocker HEAVILY discounted.  It was marked at ~$52 but when I got to the register it rang up at $25...  They had two in stock so I went back and got the other.  I figured if I got them home and they didn't pan out I could return them.  After testing at home I was pleased with the product and this will be a great speaker to take to beach or tennis court.  For $25 is a steal so check your local Kohls...  :)
