The product itself is fair for the price.  We bought it several months ago and it worked for about 3 months then totally quit.  I wrote a one star review about the product and was very surprised to hear from the company offering to replace it!  I thought the guarentee was for only 30 days but they said they wanted their customers to be happy.  So, we received a replacement and the jury is still out on how well the product will perform but as far as the company - I would give them five stars!
