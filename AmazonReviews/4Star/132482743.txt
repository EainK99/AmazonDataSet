I bought this product roughly 3 years ago from Bestbuy and it came with Pro Tools SE (aka starter's edition) which is a non-expiring demo version of the real Pro Tools. Please do not base your opinion/review of the software since it is barely capable of doing what the real Pro Tools does. The hardware on the other hand is pretty good. I've been using it for a few years now and it hasn't given me any problems, however, it all depends on your computer. If you have a weak/old computer with a small ram and hardware capacity, you will have a rough time. Pro Tool and the interface require a powerful computer to work, if not you may hear static!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Portable and great for on the go<br />Can hook up XLR Mic with Phantom Power<br />Easily hook up a guitar, keyboard, or any other external instrument<br />Audio Output on the back to hook with Speakers and Receiver<br />XLR Headphones can be hooked up in front for high quality sound<br />Built well/good quality<br />Good Price<br /><br />Cons:<br />Demo version of PT, still good for starters<br />Can't hook up two mics at the same time<br />If you plug in XLR Headphones, sound to the receiver goes away<br />Not HD Sound Quality.
