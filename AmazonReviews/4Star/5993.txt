I have an OCD in my large pedalboard that I use for gigs. It's next in line after the switcher, wireless, volume pedal and tuner, and goes before nine other pedals. In that setup, I primarly use it as a clean boost, sometimes dialing up a little attitude. I purchased the Joyo for half the price of a second OCD because I heard it was a clone and I needed one for my small rig that goes to jams and rehearsals. It is a clone, and in side by side comparisons, it's hard to tell the difference. I would say the OCD is smoother and does a better job as a clean boost, while the Joyo gets into the dirt a little quicker and is more agressive. Both are great for running into a second overdrive pedal. On the gig board, that's OCD to Soul Food. On my little jamming and pracitce board, it's Joyo to a Bad Monkey (another great low-cost pedal). So, while the OCD provides a better, more neutral clean boost and gentle overdrive, the Joyo is great choice to save money. And if I were to take one pedal to a blues jam, I'd probably take the Joyo, because I like it's distortion personality a little more than the OCD.
