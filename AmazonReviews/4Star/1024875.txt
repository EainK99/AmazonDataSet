Plastic is nice but the hardware was either missing or mismatched (i bought new screws that fit/matched). the fit around the pickups was too tight requiring sanding (epi dot studio) honestly i doubt i'll install it on this guitar and if i did it again i would take it to a luthier and pay $60 to do it right. bottom line a waist of time, not completely the vendors fault. UPDATE: with a little sanding around the pickup rings i got it to fit nicely. If you look at the picture the specs are different for each PU ring no sure why. I raised it from 3 to 4 stars. Guard looks good but i had to replace all the hardware it was either missing or the wrong size.
