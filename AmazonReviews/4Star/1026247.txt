I bought this for my squire strat. It's clearly made with some used parts- the pickups show signs of wear and tear. Can't complain given the price, but the description does say 100% brand new. Not all the screw holes lined up (only a couple did). I put 4 stars because, despite the obviously refurbished condition, it's still better than the original squire parts and sounds better too.
