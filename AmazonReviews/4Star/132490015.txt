Got this Guitar for the game Rocksmith on the PS3.<br />It came packaged great there was no damage to the boxes or the product, upon inspecting the guitar it was in perfect working order and looked exactly like the picture.<br />All items were in the box as stated.<br />It plays well with the game only problem so far is getting it to register note bending, but that is probaly just me being a novice guitar player.<br />I do recommend this product for the price, wont get a fender or epiphone for this price. Or if you just love Marvel themed items because it looks awesome hanging on the wall as well.
