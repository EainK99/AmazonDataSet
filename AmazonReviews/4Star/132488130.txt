The bow arrived in a cardboard tube. Inside the bow was wrapped in thick a thick plastic sleeve. Very well protected.  The bow was straight and exactly as advertised.  I selected the medium priced bow and was pleased with the ivory inlay.  The student I gave it to tried it and was very pleased with the bow's weight and balance.  tone was great.
