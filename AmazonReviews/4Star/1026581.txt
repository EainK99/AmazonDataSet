Being a fan of the history of Fender and of the myriad of guitars developed by Leo Fender, I wanted to add a G&L ASAT Classic to my collection. The G&L line is the, post-Fender, culmination of Leo's endless efforts to create the &#34;perfect&#34; players guitar. Whether this guitar is the result of his lifelong endeavor is up to the individual guitarist. I have played countless brands and models of guitars, including many Fender Teles and Strats. So I can say I have a pretty good idea of what a nice quality guitar should sound and feel like. I am no expert but I am knowledgeable.<br /><br />I found my ASAT Classic locally from a private seller at a terrific price. It is a 2014 set-up exactly as this listing in the clear orange with rosewood fretboard and classic C satin finish maple neck.<br /><br />Initial Impressions: It has a nice balanced weight with a solid feel... similar to a Fender American Standard Tele. There are no belly or neck cutouts so it feels more like an American Standard Tele vs. a newer Deluxe Tele.<br /><br />Body: The body is a nice medium weight Swamp Ash, with a smooth glossy finish. I would give the Swamp Ash body a 10 out of 10. I really like the transparent orange color which is subtle yet unique, letting the natural wood grain show through. It is definitely not a bold, bright, or obnoxious orange, more of a mellow color.<br /><br />Neck: The Classic C - #1 neck is on the larger side with a 12&#34; radius and feels larger and flatter as you move up the neck towards the body. This might make it challenging for smaller hands when soloing or bending high on the neck. I have average sized hands and although the neck feels chunkier and larger than my Teles it is definitely playable for me. My neck finish is the &#34;satin light tint&#34; which is not as smooth as my American Fender guitars. It feels slightly more raw than finished so if you like the natural wood feel, like on an acoustic guitar, you might prefer this neck. I would have to ratethe smoothness an 8 out of 10. It is not my favorite but it is still nice.<br /><br />Pick-ups: The MFD classic single-coil pick-ups are smooth and rich sounding with plenty of midrange and depth. There is noticeably less &#34;twang&#34; vs. a Tele but other than that most of your sound is based on your amp, pedals, and other acoustics and sound settings with pick-ups playing only a marginal part in the final sound. I will need more time to dial in the sound I am looking for but the broad range of these pick-ups should work just fine.<br /><br />Customization/Parts: I have not found a plethora of parts and/or upgrades available for G&L guitars online. This makes me a bit nervous if I need to replace or repair any part on the guitar in the future. Fender guitar parts are not necessarily interchangeable with G&L so keep that in mind if choosing a G&L. The only thing I changed so far was the &#34;top hat&#34; selector cover. I had an extra smaller round one from my Fender Deluxe Tele that fit perfectly. I will also look for G&L locking tuners soon but that is about all I plan to change at this time.<br /><br />Case: The hard-sided black Tolex case is nice and solid. It holds the guitar firmly in place and keeps it nice and safe during storage and transit. The case is secured with 3 quality latches on one side and hinges on the other. The only issue I have with it is the black fabric lining leaves small fabric particles on the guitar. They can be wiped off with a microfiber cloth but it is a bit annoying.  I would rate the case a 8 out of 10.<br /><br />Overall: I am very happy with my purchase. It is a beautiful, well-crafted guitar. I don't plan to play this guitar excessively as I bought it more for the history and nostalgia surrounding Leo Fender and his guitars. If you are looking for something a little different than the run-of-the-mill Fender Teles then give this one a look.<br /><br />Thank you for reading
