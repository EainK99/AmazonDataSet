The bow was not packaged securely,or protected. It arrived in a 5inch square tubed box. The bow in a flimsy plastic sleeve was the only item in the box. No bubble wrap. crinkled paper...nothing, so it was rattling around in this very large tube.<br />I wondered if this caused it to look scratched and worn a bit or if they sent a used bow. Needless to say, it doesn't look new. There are many hairs that have been snipped off, but also the hair doesn't look as thick and full as my older bow.<br /><br />All that aside, it does seem to be a nice bow. It's light and is weighted/ balanced well. The hair is a bit thin, not what you'd expect from a new bow, but it plays well and grabs the strings nicely.
