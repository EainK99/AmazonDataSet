This microphone is a great steal at just 20 bucks. I am currently working as a intern covering local HS and College sports and I was afraid for the money that this mic would have trouble with the high level of noise at stadiums. However, this mic does the job and does it in style, after 2 weeks of usage I couldn't be happier for 20 bucks. It cancels almost all background noise and captures your subject voice proficiently. I definitely recommend this mic to anyone needing a workhorse mic.
