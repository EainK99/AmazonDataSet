It isn't real clear that you need to buy or own an additional part for this to work: namely Pearl IS1216N/C for 12 to 16-inch toms. That costs another $25 or so, if you don't have one.<br />Secondly, that I.S.S. mount part needs to clamp onto a Pearl triple flanged super-hoop. No other rims will work.<br />Thirdly, the spurs should be pointed, or made to adjust with points that can be hidden by the rubber feet. It doesn't necessarily creep, as it's designed, but it would be more rugged if it had this typical spur feature.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a decent adaptor to get your floor tom in use as a small kick drum.
