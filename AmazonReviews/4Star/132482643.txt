I am adult amateur musician and use these bells in our wind orchestra during the holiday season. This is the 2nd time I have purchased this same set of jingle bells. I purchased the previous set about 8 years ago and it finally broke this year. Lesser quality bells break even faster. The only kind that doesn't break is the expensive ones on a stick but they are more difficult to play than this type. The description is a little off because the band that holds the bells is not metal but a heavy plastic. When playing these it is important to do any hitting against the handle not the plastic section. Other people play my bells besides me so sometimes they get abused and thus after a few years, poof... time for a new set. Fortunately they are not real expensive.
