I bought two of these to use with a matched pair of Rode NT4's.  They are perfect for use in the studio.  I mainly use them for drum overheads and occasionally for mic'ing acoustic guitar.  They hold the mics very firmly and I have no worries about the mics slipping out.  While they are well built, I do think they are overpriced though, so I took away a star for that.
