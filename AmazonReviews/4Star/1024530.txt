very good quality hardware, one issue you may face is if you are cymbal/drum/percussion etc. is mounted very high up in the boom arm, far away from the clamp itself. you will get a bit of shaking/rocking. this hasn't caused any damage, or practical issues thus far. but is still unsettling. For this kind of long distance application, I would recommend using the 'super mulitclamp' this had a larger surface area and will reduce this effect.
