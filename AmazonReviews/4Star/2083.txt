I'm a little disappointed with the battery life on these. Even if I don't use them, they seem to lose charge when they are off so I always need to charge before I'm going to use them.  Aside from that, they have performed really well. I LOVE the sound from them, the bass booms and highs are rich. If they didn't sound so good, I might have stopped using them, but it's a fair trade off to have to charge them.
