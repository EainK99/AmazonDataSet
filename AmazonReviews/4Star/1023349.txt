Buy stick-on sandpaper, and make your own nonslip pick: BEATS EVERY NONSLIP PICK I'VE TRIED!!! Since the previous words here, I have given this product a fair try. While it's a good product and does what it says, it's expensive for the number of grips you get, and my home made ones are still the best non-slips I've ever tried.
