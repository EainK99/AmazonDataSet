I often try other reeds, but keep coming back to the Hemke brand.    I rarely get a new reed from the box that is not playable.   They seem to weaken a little faster than some other brands, but keeping several playable reeds on hand and rotating them often appears to prolong the life.     I am a private music teacher and play in several ensembles and as a soloist.
