It works pretty good considering I've had it for only a month. It protects very well, but it's larger than my old case and is heavier. I don't mind though because it really does do a good job to protect my Viola. Also, my Viola is 15 inches and it's very snug, so if your Viola is bigger, I recommend getting a bigger case.
