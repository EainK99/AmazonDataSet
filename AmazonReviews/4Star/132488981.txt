I bought this mixer to use on a podcast and while it works great, there is a slight hum when I plug my computer's headphone jack into the  RCA input on the board using an adapter.  It's actually not in the recording, but I hear it in my headset. I'm still testing different configurations so there may be a way to change the input to another channel and get rid of the hum, otherwise it works fine.  I'm not a fan of the plug as others have noted, and there's no off/on switch but for the money, I think it's going to work fine for me.
