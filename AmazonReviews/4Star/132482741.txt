Very sturdy, we have one set for the sound man and the drummer uses one, too.<br /><br />When recording my band's practice sessions, the sound guys couldn't always discriminate between the room sound and what they were hearing through the board.  These helped, but the bass was still overpowering.  We solved the problem by building a small enclosure to cut the volume for them while they mixed.  Best isolation I've found for the money.  Maybe more $$'s would get better results, but I'm too cheap to experiment with my money.  I like these.
