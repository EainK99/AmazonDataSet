This is a pretty nice pedal; the ramping feature is a cool addition, and it's easy to dial in. No tone suck at all, which was a major concern of mine. One major complaint though: even with the overdrive set all the way down, it seemed to distort my tone a bit when engaged. I had planned to use this pedal for more clean applications, but found I was getting closer to the sound I wanted by using my chorus or phaser pedals. I've never had the opportunity to plug into an actual leslie, so it may just be that the emulation is TOO accurate for my taste.
