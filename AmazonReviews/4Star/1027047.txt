For a pretty cheap boom pole I am satisfied with this.The rigidity to weigh ratio is very satisfactory. The length is good for portable use. The only problem that I have is you have to really twist hard to get the sections tight enough so that they don't collapse on you while working. Tell you what, I like showing up to a paying job with a real boompole and not a painter's pole. Makes you look like you care about your craft. Even had a dude on set ask me if I was using a Rode pole.
