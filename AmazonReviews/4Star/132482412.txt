I have both the yellow and red cymbal springs. I got it for my Wuhan china with it's deep bell that would hit the wing nut on a regular stand. While it works well for this, it does have some catches to it. Tightening the screw does flatten the threads on your stand so choose a stand/arm to dedicate this spring to. The plus side to this tightening system is you can also attach it to hi-hat rods. The red spring works great for splashes and small chinas while the yellow is good for rides and large chinas. When using them for crashes the red wobbled like an out of control see-saw. The yellow is too tight which will lead to broken cymbals.<br /><br />PROS: Felts and nut all in one to simplify setup; Attaches to 6 & 8mm stands and hi-hat rods; Holds cymbals with odd shaped bells<br /><br />CONS: Damages threads; Not good for crashes
