I LOVE this tuner for the purpose it has, to tune. I have been using a snark tuner for the last 3 or 4 years now, and it does work better than the intellitouch tuners, which I've also had the privilege to use in the past as well, like others have said. Its functions are easy to use; you just hook it on your instrument, push the button, and tune away. The cents are accurate also. More so than intellitouch, in my opinion and in my experience.<br />HOWEVER, with that being said, I would like to address how it is NOT very reliable in the long term concerning its ability to keep a decent battery life or stay alive in terms of how it's made. My sister, father and I all own our very own ones. My sister and I are in separate praise teams that travel around quite frequently, while our father uses his at home whenever he has time.<br />(Notice at the top, I said I have been using \\"a\\" snark tuner. Not the same one.)<br />I don't expect a tuner to work for eternity, but I would like it to work, and not fall apart before a year is out.<br />My sister's snark's head got snapped off, and the socket part of the ball-and-socket joint joining the two pieces broke. We had to duct tape the pieces together, and to our surprise, it actually worked!!!... for a little while. I mean, it looked pretty ghetto and you had to clip it on in s certain place to see the display, but it worked. It eventually got to the point where it didn't, so that was the end of that one.<br />The one I have now, my either second or third(I can't remember), the pad that goes on the clip to hold it on to the instrument comes off everyday. I can slip it back on, but it is a delicate process. And an annoying one at that. And turning it on, currently in the middle of its normal battery life, I have to flick it to actually get me a reading. People laugh when I do that, because it looks stupid when you have to hit it in the reading face for it to work, if it does.<br />Over all, the greatness of this tuner outweighs theabove rant(s) even though it doesn't look like it does. I will definitely be telling people to get the snark, but I will suggest to get multiple, so when one breaks or dies, you have another one on hand.<br />I don't think I am rough with these tuners, but maybe my sister and I need industrial strength and military quality snark tuners.<br />Like I said I LOVE this thing, and I will continue to buy these suckers. :D
