This is a good guitar strap and only problem is that you need some mechanism to attach the upper end with the guitar neck.  I am yet to devise something to attach the strap with guitar.  They should have provided a button or some attaching devise so that the customer need not look for something else separately.<br />The price was ok and packing was good.<br />Incidentally I ordered the same strap twice by mistake. The second one I got delivered today.  Initially I thought of returning but then thought of gifting it for my son who would love to have it.
