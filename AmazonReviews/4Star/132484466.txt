I object to the reviewer who described this as being made of cheap plastic, and being nothing but a toy. I had to look twice to be sure it was not a genuine kudu horn. The only thing missing is the texture and color to better simulate a real animal horn. For that, it loses one star. This is the first time I have tried to play a shofar, and I am close to getting a sustained tone from it, so I am quite happy.<br /><br />I was quite surprised to see that the instrument came with a brightly colored cloth bag. There was nothing in the page advertising it which promised a carrying bag. For that, I should return 1/2 of a point.
