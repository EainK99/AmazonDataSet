The Good:<br /><br />If you know what you're getting, this package is a KILLER deal.<br /><br />The guitar is made from quality materials.  It has gravitas.  It appears to be made in China, and my guess would be that it's made by AXL.  Nice solid woods -- maple and rosewood neck, and probably ash for the body.<br /><br />The USB cable works.  It's made by Alesis.  There is latency when using this cable, but it's probably a function of software and computer speed.  So depending on your application, the cable may work fine (e.g., for recording), or it may induce too much latency (e.g., for live playing).<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The guitar's intonation is WAY off, the action is too high, and the fret ends are sharp.  All fixable issues if you know how to setup a guitar.  In my case, the bass E and A intonation were the worst offenders, and I needed to remove the springs and bring the saddles all the way back.<br /><br />There were also some minor fit and finish issues with the guitar.  E.g., the screws holding the bridge on weren't all the way in, and it looks like the neck screw holes were drilled off center.  Not deal killers.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />This was marketed as a learning tool for beginners.  It's terrible for that.  The software is awkward (Guitar Rig 4 -- look for separate reviews on that product).  And the guitar setup is terrible.  Both will frustrate anybody who wants to learn to play the guitar.<br /><br />Get it if you're looking for a high-quality beater and an essentially free 1/4\\" to USB cable thrown in.  Set up the guitar.  Modify it if you want to.  Get something else to learn on.<br /><br />Just an update on the software included with this package: Guitar Rig 4.  It's actually not bad as a virtual amp once it's setup.  I find that I use it pretty frequently, and it adds a lot of value to this package.  Still not good for learning how to play, but it is good for playing the guitar using your computer as the amp.
