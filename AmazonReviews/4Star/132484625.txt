Though that was not the best quality, but it is good enough for my son to use  for the school year. I had a yamaha brand for my older son which you could dismantle for easy cleaning, but this very one is just the way you see it in the picture, you can pieces it to clean because it is a one-whole-piece, but it is good especially for the price.
