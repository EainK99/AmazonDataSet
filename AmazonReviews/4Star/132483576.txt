I am well familiar with the VOCOPRO products since the majority of my fellow Karaoke DJs also use them. I decided to upgrade to the VOCOPRO wireless mics because I know the sound quality was awesome. The day I got the product, I charged the batteries and was preparing to use them that night. At the show I did the sound check and microphone one worked perfect. went to microphone 2 and it did not work. I checked the battery and made sure everything was connected correctly swapped the batteries and still nothing. Contacted Amazon to see about replacement, sad to say, no more were in stock. So had to put in for a refund.<br />Although the product did not work this time, I would still purchase another set because VOCOPRO is an excellant product to use for karaoke. Hope once my refund is returned, Stock is refilled and I can proceed to purchase another set.
