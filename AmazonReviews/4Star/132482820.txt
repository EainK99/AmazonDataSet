This was my first electric guitar, but have had an acoustic for many years, just never got really good at it. I thought this would be a fun way to enhance and encourage some additional learning. I had tested several Sessions and bought this one because the pickups seemed a little more pronounced than the others. I was really wanting a LP type guitar, with crunchy humbuckers, but after playing this Session, stopped right there and bought it. I wanted to stay under $700 and got this for $500, and for that price it is hard to beat. It sounds great clean, and is a very bluesy (sensu Stevie Ray Vaughn-eske) and strat like sounding guitar, but at the same time offers some differences.  For the most part I have been very happy, the thing sounds great and very diverse, and with the amp modeling can produce decent heavy rock and metal sounds. I have just been using a small Roland Cube 20 watt and the sounds are endless. The only really dislike is that the neck is a tad narrower than my acoustic, so have had to get use to that, and there's been a little bit of fret buzz at times (there wasn't at all at the store), but that can be worked out and kept to a minimum with more controlled and lighter picking but if this persists there are solutions for that. Overall I would say a fantastic entry-level guitar, with lots of room to grown on, that is extremely well made by Canadian and American employees.
