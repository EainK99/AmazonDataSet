These headphones certainly pump up the volume!  To be clear - I am listening mostly to my iPhone so I am not writing this review about the deep resonant bass or the clear highs that you might be after for serious listening.  This is just about sound, clarity and being able to hear distinct parts of the music at higher volumes.  Ear buds always seems to make loud music sound like a bunch of cats fighting.  These deliver clear music at higher volumes so I can actually make out the parts as intended.<br /><br />As a slightly odd example:  I used to wear ear buds under noise reducing &#34;ear muffs&#34; when I mowed the lawn.  I was trying to catch up on podcasts while I meandered around the yard for 2 hours.  Even under the ear muffs I could barely make out the spoken word (or any music I might be listening to).  Enter these CAD headphones.  I popped them on and listened to GOLF of all things and could hear the whispering announcers as if the lawn mower wasn't on.  And music sounded great too.  And without being at a volume loud enough to make my ears bleed.<br /><br />The stretchy coiled cord brings back memories of plugging into my old hi-fi back in the day and listening to Doors albums.  Now, it's a slightly updated iPhone, but mowing the lawn to &#34;Break on Through&#34; works just fine.
