Great beginner dj controller. I got this when to start djing in high school. Its a good solid controller. The only issue i have with it is the lack of the ability to grow and develop some of my skills. After about 6 or so months I found myself needing to upgrade to a higher end controller like the Numark NV, the Numark NS7III, the Pioneer DDJ-SX/SX2 or the Pioneer DDJ-SZ. All in all this is a great controller to practice on but don't expect to play to many gigs with it since it lacks a booth output and XLR outputs.
