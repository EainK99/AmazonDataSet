I finally bought these lights.  I looked everywhere and found many videos on them, but how flexible they are (or aren't) was never mentioned anywhere.  And I really needed them to be flexible.  The good news is that they are VERY flexible.  The light strip can easily wrap around a finger.  Almost around a pencil actually, but not quite.
