This case is a great value.  It is built solidly, it protects the horn well, and it accommodates my big bell horn easily (6 ½\\").  The optional [[ASIN:B0002KX5E6 Protec Padded Backpack Strap]] works well too, which will be important to some buyers.<br /><br />OTOH I do not find the upper and lower outside pockets very convenient, and I wish there were a larger, single internal storage compartment - even if it meant adding some weight and cost, as in the much more expensive [[ASIN:B000Y0252W Bam Tenor Sax Trekking Cases Black]].  Put too much stuff in the Protec case lower pocket and the case won't lay flat; too much in the upper pocket, and the open case will tilt when the horn is removed - spilling the contents if you haven't zipped the pocket closed.  The small, separate inside compartments for a mouthpiece and the neck may work well for you, but I keep my neck inside the bell, and I'd rather have more inside space for reeds, neck strap, a pencil, glasses, etc. ...<br /><br />But all-in-all, this is a fine, functional case, and it beat any similarly priced case I saw.
