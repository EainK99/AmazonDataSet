I got this on a deal and they were $20. So far they work well. I think I need to switch out the ear plugs to smaller ones, because after about 1.5 hours they start to bother my ears. I also realized that the volume from the head set is separate than whatever device you're using. I realized this because I thought they had a low volume capacity, but pressed the button on the head set to raise the volume and it went up. My phone was already at max volume though. This is made me feel better because I like listening to my music pretty loud and before this I wasn't too satisfied with the volume aspect.
