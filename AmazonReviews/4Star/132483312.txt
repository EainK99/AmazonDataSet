Took 5 minutes to put it together... Im not a huge record collector but having a record player like this has been a great way for me to hear some very obscure and much older music that I would of never thought to pick up in a million years otherwise.<br /><br />Don't let any vinyl snobs tell you that this record player doesn't cut the mustard.... Amazing bang for the buck!.<br /><br />Only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is due to it being almost too basic but I certainly have no ground for complaining.
