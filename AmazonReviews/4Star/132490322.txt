I have no idea who this guy Hal Leonard is, but I bought this book expecting it would perform as advertised and my daughter would play viola just like him. Well, after I bought this book, when she played, the dog ran away and the fish floated to the surface of the aquarium. Unless Hal is an animal killer, the book is defective because even after I bought it she still can't play. If Hal is a lousy Viola player, he shouldn't encourage people to play like him. If he's a rockstar, then he should fix his book.
