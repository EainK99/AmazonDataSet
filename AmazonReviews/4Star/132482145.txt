I got this product to use in college while my 16-input Tascam US-1600 stays at home. It does the job nicely, at least for what I need. I mainly use it for the audio drivers, because my laptop can't handle much DAW work on its own. It's also nice to have audio hardware driving my studio monitors instead of a laptop's line out. Since my primary use of this product is mixing and listening to music, I can't speak too much for, nor am I bothered by the less-than-perfect recording experience. I have only used a condenser mic with it so far, and there is a clearly audible high-pitched whine present in the audio at all times (probably due to phantom power). It's covered up by playing usually, but I'd imagine it could be audible in certain recordings under certain situations (quiet source, high gain). While this doesn't bother me since I won't be doing too much serious recording in my dorm, I'm sure this would be quite an inconvenience for some. Some people might complain about the outputs and the headphone jack being tied to the same volume knob, but this doesn't bother me at all. The overall build quality is decent; I can't complain about it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Made by Tascam; good hardware in general<br />-Small and portable; powered by USB<br />-Great for on-the-go recording/mixing<br /><br />Cons<br />-Subpar preamps; constant noise heard through mics<br />-USB power can be finnicky sometimes; one time it wouldn't stay on until I rebooted my laptop<br />-Some switches are on the back of the unit
