I've had this for nearly a year now and I can tell you from direct experience that I've taken it on and off nearly ever day from my Yamaha p-105. It's held up well. I'm just deducting a start because it has these stringy things hanging off the seams in the inside. Doesn't affect the appearance or functionality at all.
