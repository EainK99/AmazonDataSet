Yesterday I gave this product one star but now i think i have been too harsh about it. I was angry because the cord was too short but I found out that you can buy an extension cord for 5 bucks to fix it. This will still take away the 1 star because it's extra money and it still is a big mistake for me. Plus I don't even know if extrension cord will mess the sound up yet.  Btw, I really like the effect option. It puts a sweet overdrive tone and it made me really happy since my amp doesn't haven overdrive circuit. Without the effect the sound is good as well. When you listen to an mp3 it smoothly enhances the bass. You can hear the bass lines much easier.  The guide is a little bad the battery beds are inside the red cover on the right. Don't ever mess with the soft pads its extremely hard to put them back on.
