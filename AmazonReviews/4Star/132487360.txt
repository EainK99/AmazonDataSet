I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish they were cheaper.<br /><br />My background: I've been playing for 10 years. I'm a songwriter/rhythm guitarist and play everything from indie to blues, alternative, hard rock, garage rock, punk and some post rock.<br /><br />I've never liked thin strings, and my playing style incorporates a lot of slides and whatnot. I put these on my Fender Jaguar (.12s feel amazing on short-scale guitars like the Jaguar) and they've become my favorite strings! They do feel and sound different than roundwound strings, but as far as I'm concerned, they're better. They're great for chords and soloing too.<br /><br />These strings are not for everyone, and I was reluctant of purchasing them because flatwounds are used for jazz for the most part. Glad I went with my gut and bought them, they feel more natural than any other set of strings I've tried, and I used to be an Ernie Ball Regular Slinkes kind of guy.<br /><br />Getting used to flatwounds does take some time, don't let that hold you back from buying these.
