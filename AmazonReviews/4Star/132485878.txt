I have a Korg chromatic tuner that I use when I play my trumpet.  And, the Korg works fine for tuning the banjo, too.  However, with the handy clip-on tuner, it is easier to tune the banjo.  The instrument picks up vibrations from the neck, and I don't have to worry about other noises.  It is VERY directional, so you have to turn it facing you.  I was using it today, and trying to show it to someone else. They were not able to see it from the side.  But, directly...head-on...it's fine.  I'm glad that I purchased this tuner.
