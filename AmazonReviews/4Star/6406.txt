I have had this guy for 5 years now.  First guitar so no expert opinion here.  But I have beat the crap out of it and it still sounds good.  After changing strings it is not bad about staying in tune.  It projects sound really well.  Read that from other reviews and completely agree.  I am shopping for its replacement because I need a left handed guitar but this has worked fine for me as a beginner flipping it over and restringing it upside down.  Doing that I am sure I have messed up its intonation but for a hundred bucks this has done we well.  Ill probably keep it in my car and use it at the beach.
