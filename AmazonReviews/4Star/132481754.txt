I bought this beautiful keyboard gig bag.  It is light, beautiful and padded.  The zippers seem a little flimsy.  However I would have been happy to keep it but it was too small in length and width for my Roland VR-09 61 key.  Sadly, I returned it and it's hard to find something this cool looking, padded and light.  Need interior measurements added to the item description.
