For the price you can't expect it to be some perfect professional microphone. But if you are on a budget and you don't need anything fancy this could work great for you. Depending on what you are hooking it up to it may be extremely quiet. I mean Extremely Quiet! Almost to the point that you can't hear anything. But fear not. If this is the case you use a laptop as an amplifier. The sound setting in windows allows you to do this. You may need to google how exactly to do this because its a bit different depending on the version of windows you have. But you plug the mic in the mic port, the speakers (or speaker system) in their port, adjust the settings correctly and you are ready to roll. The downside with using the laptop as an amplifier is that there is a short delay between when the speaker speaks and when you hear it over the speakers. This delay is unavoidable because of it having to convert the sound from analog to digital. It is only a few milliseconds but it is a little weird when you first start talking into the mic. I used this mic to DJ at my brothers wedding reception. I had it connected to sound system with 11 speakers and 2 sub-woofers. If I were a professional DJ I'd have sprung for something more fancy. But since it was a one time thing I didn't want to break the bank and this worked just fine.
