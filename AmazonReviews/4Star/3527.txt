Purchased this head for a 1978 Ludwig Vistalite kit.  Delivery was quick, as promised.  This was just what this kit needed.  Nice boom and great attack.  I don't use double pedal much with this kit, but when I do, this head is very articulate.  Liked it so much I bought Remo CS Black dots for the toms.  Excellent!  Only downside is the dot is discoloring the beater felt.  Oh well.
