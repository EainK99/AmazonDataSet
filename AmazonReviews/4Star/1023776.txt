Comfortable, really great sound quality not even considering price.  But if you compare it to the price of other over the ear headphones it makes me like the quality even more.  Does a good job of noise isolation, the only thing that would make me give this 5 stars is if it blocked out more noise. I would give it 4.5 stars if there was an option  But overall extremely happy with the headphones, some of the best I've ever bought.  I bought these to mainly listen to jazz, blues and classical music because of the reviews I read, and they do not disappoint.
