I love the streamlined efficiency of the case. It's light yet very protective for most gigs that don't require plane travel. The zippers are heavy duty and very easy to use. The handle is perfect. Others are intrigued and want to carry it just to feel the luxury of the handle which is luxurious. Kudos all around for these features. A perfect 5 rating.<br />  But guys, what happened to the storage pockets when you thought out the design of this case ?<br />  They're very tight and small. I can fit some small supplies like batteries, pencils and my set-up kit which is jewel screwdriver kit size but very little else. They could have been a bit larger. they could have been able to expand just a bit more.<br />  I need to store the guitar cable and strap and any music i may need to bring to the gig inside the case with the bass. The pockets are that stingy.
