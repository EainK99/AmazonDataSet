Overall I like this controller, but there is one thing that drives me absolutely nuts. There's no on/off switch. It doesn't automatically power on when it's connected via USB either. You have to:<br /><br />1. Disconnect the USB cable<br />2. Hold down two random buttons simultaneously<br />3. Re-connect the USB cable<br /><br />EVERY SINGLE TIME you want to turn this thing on.<br />I cannot fathom why Roland would make this so unuser-friendly. Major design flaw!<br /><br />Aside from that the keys feel good and that's what I care about most. The 2 control knobs are so small and awkward they're pretty much unusable too.<br /><br />If you want a compact controller with good key-action this might be for you, if you're willing to overlook the weird on/off thing.
