It's a very good budget keyboard everything is great the knobs pads everything. The only reason I didn't give it 5 star is because the keys are very flimsy not just because there not semi weighted. Even when you look at them you see one key is lower then the other so they feel flimsy and the velocity is unpredictable. But I guess it's fine if you don't care about changing the velocity then this is the keyboard for you it's overall a great one for beginners and semi pros.
