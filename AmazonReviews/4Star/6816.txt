The leather is soft, extremly tought i´ve pull it very hard to test it and see if it can hold the pulling from an accidentally entrapment i´ve suffered before while walking across a narrow door or a bunch of stuffs and it is pretty solid. The lenght adjustment mechanism is quite messy, but it feels really really solid. The Strap is feels very nice over my shoulder, even when you are not wearing sleeves. The width of the strap is not too big to make it bothersome and not too narrow to hurt you, its very soft leather, feels really nice.
