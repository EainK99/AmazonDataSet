Works well with my strat. Instructions are vague. You press the power to start it and also to change modes. Once you get the hang of it, it works well. I use ear buds and can easily practice in loud environments or at home while others are sleeping. Haven't used the iPad input yet. So far, just for private practice in public places or early mornings at home. A real convenience.
