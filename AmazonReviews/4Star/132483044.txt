I really like this product; it makes a really nice rain sound and when you shake it, the beads make another noise. It is like having two toys in one, a rain maker and a maraca.  This toy is easy to grasp and hold onto, and it is really light so it makes it easy for my little one to keep her hands on. She loves hearing the sound and makes different noises when she bangs this toy with something else. It is very durable. I read some reviews where they said that it was too short, but I think that if it was any longer it would have been too hard for her to keep a hold of. This is the perfect size for a small child who is learning to hold onto things and that things make sounds and noise. Highly recommend this product!
