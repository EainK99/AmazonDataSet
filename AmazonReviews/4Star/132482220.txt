I purchased this mini mixer for use in my car. I have my smartphone, my ham radio, a scanner, and my iPad set up to play through this mixer into the auxiliary jack for my car stereo. Using a mixer, I'm able to monitor/listen to all four devices at the same time. For example, I can be listening to an audiobook on my smartphone, and still monitor the local ham repeaters for activity on the same speakers!<br /><br />Because this mixer is completely passive, it uses simple analog mixing techniques, but that results in a small but noticeable decrease in signal strength. This is true regardless of the amplifier/speaker combination you use. All this means is that you'll have to turn up the volume of your amp to get the same audio output as if you had plugged your device directly into the aux jack.<br /><br />The major advantage of this mixer is that it requires no external power supply. Otherwise, this is a very well constructed (metal case, heavy duty knobs, solid input jacks) and extremely quiet mixer. These are all the features I would expect in a passive mixer like this. I can highly recommend.<br /><br />BTW, I seldom give 5 stars... it's really got to be innovative and perform far above and beyond expectations for that kind of rating.
