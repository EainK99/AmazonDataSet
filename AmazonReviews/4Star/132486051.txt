If you are using speech to text software, this is a good choice.<br />The head strap is elastic and fits by expanding the materials to your head.<br /><br />I found wearing the unit to never blend in and I always knew I was wearing it.<br />The performance was very good, my software was configurable to the mic and I had no problems when using it for speech to text.
