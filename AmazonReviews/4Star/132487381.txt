I'll keep this short and sweet, but I will preface this by saying the following.  If you're looking to be a mobile DJ, and you don't need motorized platters, you're better off with an NS6 that costs 300 dollars less, or a DDJ SX for the same price, with touch pads.  This is a HEAVY unit, and is very difficult to move around.  I never got around to buying a coffin for it, because I returned it, and will be purchasing a DDJ SX instead.<br /><br />However, if you have your kit in one place, there's a few benefits to the NS7.  Namely, learning how to operate with motorized platters.<br /><br />Other Pros:<br />-Channel slider has the ability to select how much room you have before a channel is fully selected - very good for scratching.<br />-VERY heavy, so damaging the metal itself is difficult.<br />-Plenty of support now and to come in the future<br /><br />Other Cons:<br />-There are better options for mobile DJs.<br />-DO NOT BUY USED (unless you can see it before hand).  There's too many parts and pieces that can be broken in shipment/are detachable.  i.e. the vinyl, platters, motors, knobs, witches.<br />-Serato ONLY, unless you want to map to Traktor, VDJ, etc.  Serato works seemlessly though.  You need to make sure you get the drivers though.<br /><br />Overall, good home/club unit, but not for mobile.  Even for a stay-put unit, unless you have to have the motors, there's just better/more inclusive options.  Unless you want to drop the major cash for 1200's, amps, mixers, record collections, etc, for the best vinyl-like feel, the NS7 is where you're at.
