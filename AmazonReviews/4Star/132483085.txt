This is a 2009 model. There are some surface scratches above strings and on guard. There's grime and oxidation on metal parts, but no evidence of being played very much. The case latches are even more oxidized. The strings obviously need to be changed. These could be the ones that came from the factory. It was totally out of tune (like a child was fooling with the tuners), but it intonates OK, and I'll get right on changing the strings and tightening the tuners. Pick ups seem OK.  It was $1500 for a guitar that retails over $4000 and sells for $2800-3000. Thus, it's okay. (A few days later) Changed strings and cleaned her up, she turned into a beast for rock and roll and blues. It's all good.
