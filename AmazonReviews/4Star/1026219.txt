Good quality guitar. I took one star away because the action is a tad higher than I like, but I am getting used to it  I bought this used (non Amazon), Back in the 80's I had an Ovation Balladeer that I really liked and this Applause brings back fond memories The acoustic sound is good, but plugged in this guitar really shines. It only has two controls &#34;Tone&#34; and &#34;Gain&#34; but that is really all you need to get a great sound out of this guitar. All in all, I would recommend this AE28 to anyone looking for a good quality acoustic- electric guitar that won't break the bank.
