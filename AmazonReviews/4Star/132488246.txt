I have real Shure SM57s.  I also have another companies 'knockoff' version (twice the cost of this product).<br /><br />As far as sound goes: It's as good as the other knockoff and 90% as good as the Shure mic which is, literally, 10 times the cost of this mic.<br /><br />It's metal, not plastic (those saying it's plastic haven't taken it apart).  There are some plastic parts, but few.  This isn't a toy, it's a real mic.<br /><br />How well it stands up, we'll see, but in my first sessions with it, I was very impressed with the sound quality and the overall feel of the product.<br /><br />Good job Pyle.
