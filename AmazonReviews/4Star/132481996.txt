I like this stand because it is sturdy and will hold my notebook and all of my music without falling over or collapsing.  It is a bit heavy, but it's ok because of the carrying case.  I've only put it together and taken it apart a couple of times, so I still have a few problems with it.  But, I'm sure once I've done it a few more times, it will be easier.
