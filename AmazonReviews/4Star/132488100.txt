I use with in conjunction with a sponge in a travel sponge dish in my case.  Where I live it is very dry so this is a great help.  It does dry about for me in about 3-4 days but I play all the time I can so this is not an issue.  The water is well contained in the sponge and have had no issues with drips.  Have been using it for some time and some people were leery of wedging this in between the string but I have not see any additional stretching or wear as a result.
