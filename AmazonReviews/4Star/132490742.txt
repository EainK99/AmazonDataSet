This pedal was cheap and has a nice fuzzy distortion to it. Definitely adds punch to your bass lines. My only complaints would be that it's so small it can't run on 9V batteries,  but that was easily solved with a Dan Electrode daisy chain. As far as tone goes, there's not a whole lot you you can accomplish, and if you adjust the squeeze too much, you cut out some frequencies.
