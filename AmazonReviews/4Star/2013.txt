I do genuinely like the strings, they are very &#34;focused&#34; and loud as sh**... However they bring out a LOT of high end. They have mellowed a bit, but I've had them on a MIM precision played through an Ampeg SVT II and an Ampeg 6x10, and had to roll my tone knob down quite a bit to compensate for the overwhelming highs. They feel great and seem to still have a lot of life in them. I'd ecommend them for more modern bass playing, but for gitty rock n roll, I will probably go elsewhere next time.
