Despite the drawbars, the CTK7000 shouldn't be confused with an elite Hammond-style clonewheel costing 10 times as much. The CTK7000 is a competent and affordable keyboard that manages to come close, but doesn't quite get there. It does, however, get you a whole lot of bang for the buck. Its MIDI interface is intuitive, seamless and reliable. Its resident organ and piano tones likely won't cut it in a solo setting, but they're fine as part of combo keyboard rig when a little something extra is needed.<br /><br />As a straight-up B3 emulator, which was Casio's apparent goal with the CTK series, the 7000 puts you in the neighborhood. But even a non-critical ear can sense the effort comes off a tad too shrill - especially when you feed in the notched upper drawbars. Unlike the real deal - and this was apparently corrected in later models - the drawbars on the 7000 are incremental. The transition from one tone to another is ragged rather than smooth. Not a problem if you can set it and forget it, and you aren't making changes on the fly. Otherwise, not so great.<br /><br />But the 7000 shines when paired with something as simple as an iPad or even an iPhone running an inexpensive B3 app. In MIDI mode, turn local control off and let the app carry the load. Leave it on and combine the 7000's native voices with what the app's producing. The resulting layered effect - the 7000's piano plus the app's organ, for instance - is startlingly good. Another plus comes in the form of the array of clearly labeled inputs and outputs mounted on the back of the 7000's chassis that effectively transform the keyboard into a mini-mult box.<br /><br />The mandatory symphonic and percussion voices are mostly toyish sounding, an ailment that can be remedied by using the keyboard in MIDI mode. But there's nothing toyish about the 7000's construction. It's hefty, surprisingly solid and seemingly immune to road rash. As a keyboard designed to compete with the upscale clonewheels, Casio could have left the cheap bells and whistles and ratty-tat stuff at home.<br /><br />If you're looking for something functional to pair with a clonewheel or a tonewheel, a five octave MIDI unit or a good spare bedroom keyboard to get you started, the 7000 is hard to beat for the price. Steal a deal while you still can.
