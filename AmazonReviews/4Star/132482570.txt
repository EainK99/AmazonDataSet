Great solid item.<br />In a world where too often stuff turns out to be too cheaply made, this was a surprise.  The weight and thickness of the metals are probably a little overbuilt.  If in fact most people use this to hold up lightweight books or sheet music, I'm surprised they used such heavy materials.  The post I believe is solid bar.  The sheet metal is very thick, not easily deformed like a turkey pan, and the adjustable collar is a heavy cast metal piece.  Includes two thumb turn set screws for friction set adjustments.<br /><br />I use mine to hold a 13&#34; macbook air laptop.  But, I turn it around.  I am a stand-up guitarist, so I look DOWN at this tray.  Therefore, I have the laptop setting into the crease.  As you are looking at this image online, you would be in the audience, and I would be BEHIND the microphone stand facing you.  My macbook air would be tilted down, laying on this tray.  The keyboard portion lay on the large pan, and the monitor portion rests against the narrow pay.  From your viewing position in the audience, you would see the back of my monitor as you looked at this image.... I then hold the laptop down with a little velcro-bungee cord.<br /><br />Rock and Roll People !!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />:)
