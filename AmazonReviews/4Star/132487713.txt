The ligths are mighty bright, indeed - when they work. But due to poor quality, the switch will not last long, and the light will only function on low (which is not sufficient). Amazon also rejects any return/refund after three months of use.<br /><br />Update December 2013: I complained about the malfunction directly to Mighty Bright in August and finally got a response last month. They sent me a new one, no questions asked, and that one has been working flawlessly. My assessment stands: \\"Good when it works.\\"
