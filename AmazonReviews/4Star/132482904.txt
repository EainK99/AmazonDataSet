Orange (if they're truly the manufacturer, after all) appears to have a great cable here - the connector is quality, the strain relief is of the best I've seen, and the added velcro tie included makes it easy to keep this cable coiled up nicely for storage & travel. Nice touch.<br /><br />The colored outer jacket is not a fabric 'carpet cable' wrap like lots of retro-looking cables, but is a mesh material similar to these 'bundling' conduits you might buy to organize many cords into a single 'snake' to clean up a spaghetti mess of wires. The jacketing is great quality and unique from other instrument cables in appearance, feel, and probably durability, too.<br /><br />I suspect this mesh jacketing will help prevent kinks and tangles a bit. But the 'mesh' nature of it will subtract a star for my needs. I have pets and cat/dog hair may find its way - along with other debris, perhaps - into the mesh surface. It hasn't posed a problem yet, but if you don't keep your gear clean and expect this cable to travel a lot, it may get 'gunky' faster than a standard instrument cable with rubber-type jacketing. Then again, since it's not a fabric 'carpet cable' jacket, you could easily wipe or even wash this thing off. Over all, it should work really well and certainly looks hawt. The orange color is not 'bright' but more of a spicy orange which suits my Ibanez bass better, anyway.
