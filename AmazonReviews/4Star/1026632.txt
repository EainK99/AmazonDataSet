Single input and three band equalization, 3.5mm input and quarter inch phones jack output.<br /><br />The 15 watts through an 8 inch speaker will Rumble your living room anyway.<br /><br />This can be used for electronic drums or keyboard also, besides bass guitar and of course 6 string with a multi effects pedal too. It won't quite keep up to live drums though.<br /><br />It's a solid little transistor amp that's 16 lbs and 15 x 15 x 8 inches deep.<br /><br />A good warranty and a low price makes this pretty cool.
