This cajon is awesome! I've been playing beats on everything around the house for years and now I have something to play with. It sounds great and is pretty solid so I don't see any problems that could happen in the future. It adjusts pretty easily. You just have to turn two screws on the bottom of the cojon with the allen wrench that it came with. Overall, it's amazing! I can't wait to use it more!
