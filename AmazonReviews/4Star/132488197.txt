I really love the sound quality and all the fantastic features this product offers for a really affordable price. I have used it for a few weeks and started to really appreciate this little recorder. Unfortunately today the display suddenly started to show strange vertical lines all over the LCD screen. No matter what i tried i couldnt get rid of that. I have treated this product with the outmost care so i was really surprised that the screen suddenly started to malfunction for no reason. All other features still work fine but if the display screen fails it becomes pretty hard and frustrating to operate this device. I really wanted to keep and enjoy this recorder longer than it lasted and finish the songs i was working on, but thank god i still have a day left to return it for a refund. I will probably order it again if i find it for the same price or cheaper. I just hope the next one i get will last much longer than the one i'm returning now.<br /><br />Edit: I ordered the R8 for the second time after i returned my malfunctioning one, and I will adjust my rating up or down in the next couple of weeks depending on how reliable this next model turns out to be. Time will tell...
