Bought this for my daughters' weddings. One down and it worked great. In fact our niece borrowed it for her wedding the next weekend. The one problem we ran into was the cord that connects it to the amp was defective. Luckily I was able to get another one in time. One thing to look out for is you have to make sure the mike is turned off, not just muted, when you're done.
