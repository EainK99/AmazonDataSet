I bought this mic because I thought the price was a Steal at the time and you couldn't find it anywhere cheaper!<br />It had a very good weight to it and was solid, but I could never get it to quite stand up on it's own stand (I had a desktop one and use it for this mic) and the shock mount was always loose but overall its a nice mic and had a decent quality to it. Even though this item is not longer available I'd recommend other Legacy products!
