I've used these a few times, and have never had any trouble.  Quality seems average, which I expected given the manufacturer/brand.  I'm taking off one star because the price is higher than many standard XLR cables of the same length, and XLR cables work just fine for DMX 99% of the time, based on my experience using several DMX lights and controllers using standard XLR cables.  I've never had a single problem with XLR cables and any of my DMX equipment, though I'm told that there's a small chance of flickering issues and such using XLR cables.  But, for the mid-quality products I've used, I've never had trouble using XLR cables.  If money is an issue, I'd suggest just using XLR cables as there's such a tiny chance of having any problems that a DMX cable would solve.
