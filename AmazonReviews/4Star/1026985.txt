OK, I was a dope  and I have revised my review.  I thought this would work on the NTG3 which apparently is a couple of mm smaller in diameter than the NTG1 & NTG2. In my defense, you have to read the fine print on the Amazon product page to see that it is recommended for the NTG1 & NTG 2 but it does not say that it is not for the NTG3. When handling these microphones all 3 seem to be the same diameter but there is a tiny difference. Upon investigating the Rode website I discovered that there is a version specifically for the HTG3. It is called the WS7 windscreen. I have since purchased the WS7 and it fits much better. But I still deduct one star for Amazon not making this obvious on the website and not suggesting that there is also a model WS7.
