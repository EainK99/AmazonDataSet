I bought this for my grandson with Downs Syndrome. I wish It was metal instead of wood due to the difference in sound. the good thing about this one is that the top is flush so my grandson has no problem hitting the bars. We have a metal one but the way it is made it has studs that stick up higher than the bars and my grandson has trouble hitting the bars instead of the studs.
