I had reservations about this, but it has been pleasantly surprising .  I have used this successfully with a nexus 7 and iPhone over Bluetooth. This thing is loud enough that we used it by the pool for music. And my sister asked me to turn it down it was so loud. We were out there rocking it for 3 hours and the speaker showed no signs of stopping.
