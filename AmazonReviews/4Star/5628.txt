I am not really a brush player, but I am recording some music that would go well with brushes.  I got these because I wanted the ability to mix in little rim shots, and I knew I would appreciate the slightly thicker and longer wood handles.  The brushes themselves seem very soft and musical.  I got a great sound with such simple patterns, which is the sign of a good instrument.  Love the ability to rim shot, most of all, and I was pleasantly surprised to see they come with a plastic tubular case.  So glad I got these instead of using the fan-out ones with the rubber handles and those round hooks protruding at the ends.  Great purchase ... recommend !
