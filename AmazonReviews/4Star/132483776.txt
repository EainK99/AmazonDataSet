Great product; effective placement of lots of information. I will be using this to enhance learning for my two grandchildren (6 and 8 years old) and myself. I am sure this product will provide us with plenty of learning information that will be referred to for quite a while. Other reviews mentioned poor packaging when it arrived in a tube. Mine arrived in a narrow and shallow box and the result was a slightly curved product that has already flattened itself out after a 20-minute breather from the packaging. Nice touch!
