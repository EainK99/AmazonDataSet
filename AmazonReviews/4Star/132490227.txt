Easy to carry in its bag, go tall (standing) or short (sometimes I sit when leading sing-a-longs at Assisted Cares), sturdy - holds the heavy books. The hinges seem to be the weak point, yet even after a couple broke off, I still used the stand for almost a year.  Will order again when I need another stand.  Make sure the nut at the top is loosened before you move the table.
