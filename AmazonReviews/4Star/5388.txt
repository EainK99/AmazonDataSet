For a beginner this is an excellent harp. It is quite comfortable to play. The tone is good. The comb is not rough on the tongue when tongue blocking. Not meaning to be gross, but even tapping the spit out of this harmonica is easier than with some other models.<br /><br />This is a good model of harmonica, in fact, it is one of my two favorites, the other being the Fender Blues DeVille. Unfortunately, the Special 20 in C that I received was not airtight like the one I bought in the key of A. That one I gave a five star rating, but this one gets 4 stars.<br /><br />This one is a bit more of a challenge to play. Not terribly leaky, like the Blues Harps I've tried, but still not as airtight as I would like. Also, unlike any other harps I've played, I have trouble with the #8 draw note. Usually, if I have trouble with any notes, it is the draw notes on the #2 and #3 holes. Luckily, I have no problem with those notes on this harmonica.<br /><br />There are two harmonicas which are similar to this one that I shall compare and contrast..<br /><br />Lee Oskar Major Diatonic: Looks practically the same, but it isn't. Narrower than this one, uncomfortably so, in my opinion. Since it is narrower, the tone is more compressed, and I think, not as good. On the plus side, it is quite easy to find replacement reed plates for Lee Oskar harps (cheapest price I found recently was $18.99 and free shipping).<br /><br />I checked the Hohner site, and found a spot where I could select replacement reed plates. They are, including shipping, almost identical in price to the harmonica. The point of buying replacement reed plates instead of a whole new harp is to save money. And, on the Hohner site, no reed plates were available in any key. Odd.<br /><br />One last thing about the Lee Oskar.. the cover plates have deep engravings, especially the top cover plate. This makes the cover plates less smooth than the SP20 cover plates, and therefore, less comfortable.<br /><br />Bushman Delta Frost: This one also looks almost identical to the Special 20. The DF is a good harmonica. Phosphor bronze reeds instead of the brass Hohner reeds. Phosphor bronze tends to last longer than brass, supposedly. The tone of the DF is different from the SP20, but I'd say it is as good.<br /><br />It is possible to get replacement reed plates for the DF. The reed plates are shipped attached to a new comb. I don't know why. So, if you are swapping out reed plates on your DF, you'll be changing the comb too. Reed plates and comb can be found for $24.99 and free shipping.<br /><br />Two things I don't like about the DF:<br /><br />1. The plastic comb sticks out kinda far in the back..much more so than on the Special 20. I end up resting the middle finger of my left hand on the edge of the comb. This feels uncomfortable.<br /><br />2. The DF does not come with a case, like most harps, or a leather sleeve, like the Seydel harmonicas. So, if you want to carry it in something, you'll need to save the box, and save the wrapping paper too. Wrap the harmonica in the paper, then stuff it in the box. The paper keeps the harmonica from rattling around.<br /><br />If you don't think you'll mind the comb sticking out in the back of the harp, and also won't mind not having a case, then I'd say you might find the Delta Frost to be as good as the Special 20. If you don't mind a narrower harp with inferior comfort and tone, buy a Lee Oskar.ood harmonica. Phosphor bronze reeds instead of the brass Hohner reeds.
