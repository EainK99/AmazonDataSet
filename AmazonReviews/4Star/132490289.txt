Aurum Cables manufacture guitar cables in a wide variety of lengths, from 18 inches, up to 100 feet.  I was sent a 25' cord for evaluation, and believe that for the price, it's a pretty good value, although with a cord that is a little thinner than some, it may not be the most rugged around.<br /><br />In my experience, most guitar cables eventually do fail, and when it happens, it is usually at the connector.  This cord has standard ¼\\" straight pin connectors at each end.  The connectors are sealed, so the wiring is inaccessible.  They seem to be designed to provide some strain relief, but the cord seems to be rather flexible, which may contribute to it eventually failing.<br /><br />I prefer a cord with an L type jack at one end, like [[ASIN:B005XOE7OI Fender's 099-0820-006 Performance Series cable]], because the L jack usually allows for some strain relief, and more freedom of movement.  Aurum also makes a [[ASIN:B00CAZK16Q similar cord]], but unfortunately they did not send me one to review.<br /><br />While not what I would call heavy duty, the various cord lengths are economically priced, and are a good value buy.  If you need a medium duty guitar cord, you might want to give Aurum some consideration.
