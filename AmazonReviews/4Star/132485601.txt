I needed to get my Fender Pro 185 amp protected from the dust of my practice area (a garage) this was priced right and readily available so i purchased it. I am pleased with it. I don't move the amp a lot so i can not state how it would hold up gigging. But for this application it is excellent. The material is not real heavy but seems rugged enough to last me.
