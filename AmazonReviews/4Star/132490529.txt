For the competitive price on this little guitar, it wouldn't matter if this guitar was built in the US, Japan or elsewhere. This guitar is a sample of the Fender electric series that double for mellow strumming or maxed out AMP nearly taking out the windows of the house!! Worth a quick look and trial at this price!
