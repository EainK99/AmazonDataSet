A sturdy aluminum and smooth pedal that does the work perfectly. It has a double function for me (not simultaneously). I use as a volume pedal with my i Rig Stomp/Iphone-Amplitube config. sometimes, and as an expression pedal, with my Stealth Pedal and amplitube-MacBook pro configuration. Don't have any complain so far, the only issue that bothers my mind is the cord and spring mechanism, but haven't heard of any bad comment about it neither. Still is worth the money, because it surely does the job.<br />I recommend it!
