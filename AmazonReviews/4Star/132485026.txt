Its a nice little guitar for young girls who want to learn how to start playing music. I didnt notice or feel anything bad about the quality... feels sturdy and the design in front is very cute and colorful. I had no strings break while tuning. The package included a red pick, 6 chord cards, and 6 string post stickers with the string letter on it; though they dont stick too well. No straps included, so thats something extra you have to get.
