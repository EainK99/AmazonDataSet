I wanted to pick up a small tuner to go with a Washburn Rover. The Snark fit the bill, and is quicker and nearly as accurate as my Korg chromatic tuner that cost much more.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of a perceived weakness with the articulating ball and socket. It doesn't feel as robust as I'd hoped, and looks like a point of failure down the road.)
