I've been searching for the ideal no-frills MIDI controller that can fit into checked luggage for piano practice on the road.  I believe I may have finally found it.<br /><br />At just a tad under 28.5&#34; wide, this fits perfectly into a larger suitcase.  I have not traveled with it yet and will update this review after some time on the road.  My previous travel solutions have included an Alesis Q25 in a smaller suitcase, and a Novation Inpulse 49 in it's own Pelican case.<br /><br />The keys on the Q25 managed to fail within a few months under the stress of travel, and hauling that Novation around in a flight case is a total nightmare because of the weight, the extra piece of luggage, the cumbersome nature of the thing, and also because every single security person, desk agent and customer service representative who sees me with it stops me and I have to explain that no, it's not a damn rifle.<br /><br />Anyway, back on topic.  This keyboard is very solidly built... especially for the price.  Compared to the 4 other MIDI controllers I own and play, this definitely has the best action.  Doesn't feel anywhere even close to a real piano, nor did I expect it to.  Nose to nose against my Impulse 49, I actually give the edge to this.  It still feels a bit synthy and plasticy but overall it's quite nice.<br /><br />There isn't a great deal of information online about this model, which is a shame because it fits a very specific niche that would make a subset of folks who want to practice piano but are stuck on business travel very happy.  Apparently, ICON manufactures their own keybed for this.  This keybed to my feel is superior to the Fatar on my Novation Remote SL37.  It feels a little better weighted, has less synth style spring rebound, and more importantly feels a lot tighter and more solid across the board.<br /><br />The case is metal!  This does not feel or look like a sub $200 keyboard.<br /><br />The minimal controls are exactly what I want for my purposes.  If you want a lot of knobs and sliders, look elsewhere.  The touch expression controls worked very well in my testing, but won't really use them, so I don't care.<br /><br />This is advertised as bundled with a Cubase LE license.  Mine did not come with that and came with Samplitude 11 Silver.  I have not installed or demoed this software and probably won't unless I'm sitting around completely bored.  Surely anyone buying this already owns multiple MIDI controllers and already has a DAW loaded up with whatever is to their preference.  I personally like Cantable Solo + Pianoteq supplemented by a few other commercial and free VST's I've collected over the years.<br /><br />From the minute I took it out of the box to the several hours I've spent playing it, I've been nothing but happy.  I really love this little keyboard.
