Great box, well built and worked perfectly. We were having trouble with the PA and after testing each cable we located a faulty one and fixed the problem. Gear on the road always gets damaged and usually the fault is not visible. The only problem I can see with the unit is directions are vague and confusing, That problem was solved by plugging in a known good cable of different types and watching the light patterns and writing them down in the PA manual. It is a time saver when you have a faulty cable and cannot locate it..EVERY band needs one. Geno N
