This is a studio monitor, which means it is intended to provide extremely accurate sound reproduction, close to the actual source. This particular monitor is well-suited for an average-sized space, due to its power output. It seems to meet my requirements for a decent studio monitor, while also doubling as a reference monitor to listen to other music extremely close to the original source -- in other words, as intended.<br /><br />This monitor is heavy. Don't confuse this with a simple stereo speaker or bookshelf speaker. The cabinet is well designed, with an extremely tight seal, and exhibits zero vibration when in use. The weight is probably a result of two things: the 100-watt self-contained amplifier and associated components, and the internal bracing the manufacturer claims results in zero vibrations.<br /><br />The woofer is exposed -- there's no cover for this. Keep this in mind if you will be using this around children or other clumsy people. The tweeter is behind a grill, but the woofer is not. The woofer is extremely rigid, but the surround can be damaged if not handled properly. The center is concave, as opposed to convex centers on many speakers. There is a thin but extremely long bass port at the bottom. The only other markings on the front are two labels (&#34;Samson&#34; and &#34;ResolvSE&#34;), and a single white LED that lights when powered-on.<br /><br />The bottom has two foam &#34;feet&#34; which are anti-skid and prevent the speaker from vibrating against a hard surface, if placed on a hard floor, desk, counter, or other workstation.<br /><br />On the back, there are three inputs: Balanced XLR, a single RCA, and a 1/4-inch. There is a &#34;HF Level&#34; control which allows you to control the level in 2-dB increments from -2dB to +4dB. There is a volume knob that goes from 0 to 10. There's a single rocker power switch, and below it a switch for 120VAC or 240VAC. The power cable is detachable and is standard 3-prong, grounded.<br /><br />It uses 175 W, probably dependent upon volume setting.<br /><br />It is labeled &#34;Made in China&#34;, while designed and engineering in the USA.<br /><br />I think this sounds incredibly accurate. Connected to my laptop, it produces strings and orchestra sounds extremely well. If you add rhythm tracks to instrument sounds, everything remains extremely distinct and clean. Only at extremely high volume settings does the bass tend to distort other sounds.<br /><br />The internal 100-watt amplifier drives this monitor quite well with little distortion. It's been a while since I've heard a 100-watt amplifier -- this monitor is LOUD. There's no reason why this can't be used as a small performance amplifier-speaker combination.<br /><br />Being a monitor, however, creates restrictions. I find that bass is very directional with this monitor. In order to hear the best bass, you want to have the woofer facing direction at you. At any angle off-center, low frequencies are diminished. It actually gets worse the more off-center you move to either side or around it. While you can expect this, it's actually quite dramatic. It could be a result of this only having an 8-inch woofer. However, the bass output is good -- as long as you remain on-axis.<br /><br />You may also want to raise this to ear-level, either on a stand, shelf, or some other surface.<br /><br />Would I recommend this for a studio? Probably, especially for electronic music production.175 W, probably dependent upon volume setting.<br /><br />It is labeled &#34;Made in China&#34;, while designed and engineering in the USA.<br /><br />I think this sounds incredibly accurate.
