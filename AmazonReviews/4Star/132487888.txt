It is a good price and the package has every thing in it.<br />However, the snake skin gives me problem.<br />The snake  scales stick out to snag  the bow hair.<br />Should the manufacturer smooth out the scale during production?<br />At the present rate the horse hair will all be broken !!<br />  I think this erhu manufacturer is an old company.<br />I think they should have better quality control.
