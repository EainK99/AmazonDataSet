This case was purchased for my son's 1/2 size fiddle. The case that came with his outfit, was really cheap, and only lasted about a year before it started to fall apart. This case has been great. We've had it over a year now, and it still looks brand new. It is very sturdy, and padded well. The zippers are good quality and don't jam. the lining is plush, and the tops of the bow holders is still in place. I have had three cases that all have come unglued at the top of the bow holders. There is ample room for storing accessories and music. He can get his fiddle and shoulder rest in the interior compartment as well as two bows, rosin, extra bride, tuner and mute. He uses the exterior compartment for his music book, cleaning cloth, extra strings, and some learning accessories that he doesn't really use anymore. ( a Bow right, and a Kinder Chin pad) I am really pleased with this purchase, and will probably order myself a full size case for my fiddle as well. The only complaint I can think of is, one of the straps on the back when set up like a back pack, won't stay fastened. This drives my son crazy, but it's not that big of  a deal. I'm going to see if I can figure out a way to fix it.
