Not sure that our 10 month old grandson appreciates the quality of the tone or, how well made this toy is but he does seem to enjoy placing the &#34;hammer&#34; in his mouth to chew on!  His 9 year old cousin likes making music on it and poking out tones.  I find that kind of fun myself.  So, I am thinking this is a toy that he will grow into.
