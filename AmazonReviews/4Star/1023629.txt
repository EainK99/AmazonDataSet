This Music Stand Light is small and compact.  What I like the most is I can clamp it anywhere on the lip of my worktable.  I am using it to have light closer to the jewelry I create.  I would like the light to be brighter, even with the two levels of light.  The neck does adapt once I got accustomed to how it likes to be turned.<br />IT is great for reading music however.  If I had a keyboard or piano, it would be perfect.
