Hello:<br /><br />the original Kluson company made this type of tuning keys back in the day, the reissues are a lot better and don't have play in them.<br /><br />The Tonepros version is a lot better in my opinion, the casing on the tonepros is more solid where the klusons have a stamped metal casing.<br /><br />If you have a vintage guitar and you want a tuning key similar to the one that was on it, klusons are the way to go, put the original tuning keys away, and use the klusons, this way you don't ruin your investment.<br /><br />Gotoh has a set which fender uses, they are more or less almost identical to the klusons, some of the older gotohs have a nylon bushing that goes bad and causes play in the tuning key.<br /><br />all in all the kluson 6 in line is a direct fit for most fender guitars, and in my opinion it should add to the value and the appearance of the guitar because the original fenders back in the day used Klusons.
