I wasn't expecting much considering it was $30 but I needed something cheap and fast. I wasn't pleasantly surprised that it did not feel cheap. The shock mount is a little bit small at 45mm would have been nice to know before hand but it works on my Audio Technica ATR2500 which is 50mm. luckily the clips for the microphone holder come off easily so I was able to muscle the microphone in there. If you also have an ATR2500 or an AT2020, try turning the shock mount upside down to get the microphone in there. Thats what I did and the shock mount works perfectly! Overall the product is very good!
