I recently switched from the Aguilar octave to this tank. I play a passive schecter and noticed it was a bit glitchy after Ab on the E string and didnt seem to track at all after that (it kind of guesses what note your playing and jumps around). So i started my research...Youll want this pedal as close to your original signal as possible and preferably right after a compressor (such as the MXR M87) and it has less problems. As with all basses you have a Dead Zone so between the 5th and 7th-9th frets youll have some complications that again are corrected with a compressor. This is not isolated to this pedal, I have played many octave pedals and they all have the same problem...I repeat this is not a complication of the pedal merely the effect.<br /><br />Many bass players i know have the Boss Octave...That thing cant track anything lower than the 9th fret...I tried 6weeks on different configurations and order and could get a TRUE octave...Playing it through a computer shows that the pedal was, at more than half the notes, jumping half steps from your dry signal...now as i jumped to 12th fret it was tracking perfectly...but so would any pedal...<br /><br />I am not %100 satisfied with the pedal...for the price i would like better tracking...but its a solid build, hasnt failed me yet and the Mid boost is amazing almost creating a Third voice...almost. The mid boost can be altered by removing the back of the pedal to matching your playing styles (BTW the mid boost dosent help the pedal track any better).<br /><br />Love the pedal...but chain order is vital to an octave pedal for a true track.
