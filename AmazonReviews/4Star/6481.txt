I like this banjolele, it is very sturdy. The first thing I noticed though was how inexpensive the strings were. So I went out and bought some replacements. They DO have zither pins as tuning pegs, therefore you have to put the string through the hole, then precede to twist the pin with the tool provided, making sure the rest of the strings gets wrapped under the other side of the string that is looping around the pin. It is tricky to figure out, I broke a whole pack of strings trying to figure it out, so that was another $12 I put into this thing. But overall I like the sound. If you're not used to this type of stringing, take it to someone who can do it for you. It's labeled as a toy, but I'm an adult and I enjoy playing it.
