One of the many issues Multiple Sclerosis causes is muscle  control, for me specifically my ability grip in my right hand. Traditional pics spin in between my fingers as I cannot grip the pic tight enough to keep it from spinning, even the ones with grip pads. On a hot day I tend to drop 3 or 4 pics in a set. Not only is this frustrating but I get emotionally upset as this reminds me every time I play I have this !@#$ disease. Gravity pics truly let me play without thinking about such a simple thing as not being able to hold a pic. I can also easily flip it around for finger picking and bring it right back for strumming. Only thing is it tends to wear down and the plastic dust gets all over the fret board. I'm OK with this as the benefits for me far out weigh this very minor issue
