When I first got this product I thought that it seemed pretty flimsy. I just wasn't sure that I would feel safe putting my laptop on it. After I assembled it and set it to about the second tallest setting (I like how it is adjustable), I put my laptop on the nice foam cushioning (another plus, that's nice) and took a step back, thinking it might collapse at any moment.<br /><br />But it didn't.<br /><br />So I wiggled it back and forth and pushed it to and fro. And it was solid!<br /><br />I now trust this with my laptop, even around my stupid cats.
