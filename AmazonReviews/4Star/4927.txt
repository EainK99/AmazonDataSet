I have never been a fan of Pearl drums, having been offered an endorsement back in the 80s only to turn them down and buy my own Yamahas. Moreover, I have become a staunch Keller addict, using as my primary kit a 1996 DW Keller shell pack.  However, I recently took a job mandating use of a Pearl Vision birch package that shipped nearly completely unassembled, forcing me to put the entirety together--crappy Pearl heads and all.  In the process, I noted several splintered spots in the internal shell walls, in particular within the floor tom, but also could not miss the impeccably perfect and solid bearing edges on all.  When completely assembled, I was amazed by the beautiful tones produced--even with the questionable heads.  Surprisingly, the steel Sensitone snare was easy to bring to a more than acceptable tuning with a near perfect response. I suggest a tightly cranked rez head with a moderatly tightened and tuned batter. The toms and kick were a breeze to bring to a uniform and sweet tonality similar to Mapex Saturn IIs, a much more expensive package. As for the hardware, I would ask Pearl why they bother shipping that junk!  The snare stand is a joke and the cymbal/HH stands could not compete with 1940's single brace Leedy riveted floor stands.  All said, however, in spite of the shell flaws (a condition potentially calling into question their roadability), the finish is really pretty, the drums play well and sound beautiful, and I would recommend the Pearl Vision Birch Fusion package (keep the hardware) for any situation where the kit is to remain stasis for long periods.
