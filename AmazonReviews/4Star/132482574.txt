I purchased this as a gift for a 5yr old who is musically inclined. The price is definitely right and the ukulele arrived exactly as described. No, it is not top of the line but it is an exceptional value in my book. My grandson was thrilled with the gift and it gives his dad a chance to show him how to tune and use a stringed instrument.
