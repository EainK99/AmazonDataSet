Although the remote is a bit quirky, these lights are pretty solid.  They light up brightly, you can crate your own custom colors and they also have a strobe light setting (if you're into that sorta thing).  They even come with 3M tape so you can easy affix them to any surface.  I actually bought a second set... they're that cool.
