I purchased two of these re-issue PL80 mics and use them live.  The mic is as good as anything else in this price range.  I particularly like the coating on the classic finish; it is slightly textured and feels great in your hand.  I get good gain-before-feedback and the handling noise is very low, due in part to the mass and weight of the body, which is substantial.  Like all cardioid/hypercardioid mics, there is some proximity effect, but not as much as others I've used.  The tone of the mic is clean and clear, without being \\"brittle\\" up top, rounded out by good bottom end that never really gets too boomy, even when used up close.<br /><br />The only negative I have experienced with this mic is that it is way more prone to plosive pops than, say, the Shure SM58.  I have used the PL80 side by side with the SM58 and it pops far more easily with P's.  I have learned to compensate for this, but if you're used the forgiving nature of the SM58 with plosives, you will have to adjust your mic technique when using this mic.
