I'm a new player.  Everything sounds scratchy and terrible until I actually get comfortable with the song.  Directly into headphones or speakers, I miss the sound that reverberates out of the body of the acoustic violin. But this is an electric violin, so when it is plugged into electric guitar amps and accessories, it can make music unlike anything that can be made with an acoustic violin alone.<br /><br />It takes a lot of getting used to because the sound is so different and it comes from different directions.<br /><br />I initially ordered it so I can practice at 4 am when I get up.  However, it is still way too loud to do that with the family asleep in a nearby room.<br /><br />That being said, during the day, when there are other noises about, I can practice in the next room and not disturb those watching TV or listening to music.  Sometimes I can practice and after putting it up get reminded to do my practice.<br /><br />The headphones that come with it suck.  I got some good ones that cover the ears and keep out noise so my practice is not disturbed by surrounding sounds.<br /><br />I love it.  But it took some getting used to.  I find it is better not to learn new songs on it, but to practice songs I already know. The sound is different than the acoustic violin, but much better when combined with the right amp and accessories.
