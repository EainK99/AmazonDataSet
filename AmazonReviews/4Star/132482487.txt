First of all let me just say this, for recording, do not use a MAC. M Audio makes great keyboard's as ive had the top of the line 61 key before and it was great! The company gave me great support although I only needed it once, everything is pretty self explanatory, seems everyone on here is having issues with a MAC, for obvious reasons IOS/MAC does not support alot of things, try it on a PC before you start judging M Audio for your own faulty problems. this keyboard works great with REASON, especially on the latest 6.5, I have pro tools but im not a fan of using pro tools I prefer Reason, the hardware device support is great. great buy for the money!!
