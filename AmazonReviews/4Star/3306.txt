The TSSS Super Par is a cheap fixture, made in China. It's cheap for a reason. It's made of very thin plastic. Even the clear front plate over the LEDs is thin plastic. The hanging yoke is a scissor type, which allows for use as an up light. However, the yoke is very thin metal. I ordered 6 of these, and they all worked. They look impressive from out in the house, behind a band. I highly recommend a good storage case for these. Don't count on these fixtures holding up more than about a year of light gigging use before they either stop working, or crack under the constant riggers of gigging on the road.<br /><br />For the price, these fixtures will certainly suffice for beginning bands, or performers on a tight budget until better quality fixtures can be had.<br /><br />The power cord on this model is not removable. However, if you do end up with a damaged cord over time, it can be removed. The cord is connected internally by a jumper, which can be unplugged. You can get a replacement cord, and strip it's ends, and solder them to the jumper, and use the threaded nut on the back of the fixture to secure the cord with. Just be careful not to get the wiring wrong.<br /><br />If you want to use these fixtures as up lights, you'll need to get right angle DMX cables, or right angle adaptors (male, and female) for your existing cables. The DMX ports are on the back, and point outward, so regular cables will prevent the fixture being pointed vertically.<br /><br />The control panel is fairly easy to use, but I don't much care for the tiny buttons, which feel like they could break easily. The digital display on the back is quite exposed, and could also be easily damaged if pressed on accidentally, while packing, or unpacking the fixtures. I feel this display should've been better protected with a more durable cover plate, like in the better quality fixtures by other manufacturers.<br /><br />This model does not have an internal cooling fan, and does not get hot during use. You can barely feel a little warmth on the back, where the circuit board for the power supply, and controller are located. However, the ventilation grid is in the form of wide holes, which I fear might crack if pressed accidentally while packing, or unpacking. Also, the holes are large enough for bugs to enter during use. I recommend a bit of screen mesh, held in place with small screws, or gaffer's tape.<br /><br />Still, for what I need these for, and on a tight budget, these will do for a little while. I've still got to order a couple more to complete the set on each stand. By the way, stands are where these work best.
