This is not a great instrument. This isn't an indestructible toy. It is a kids guitar.<br /><br />This is an ok first guitar for a quickly growing kid. It has worked fine for us. It does have to be retuned pretty often. In my experience, you have to do that all the time when a kid is using the instrument anyway. The strings are awful. They won't last so buy a better set when you order this. They will hold a tune better as well. I loved the post covers. What a great idea. This works fine for my lefty. It will work fine until he needs a larger one.
