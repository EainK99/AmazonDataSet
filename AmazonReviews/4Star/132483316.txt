I love the lightweight, yet protective nature of this case. As other reviewers have stated, there is a compartment on the inside that holds my tuner and the polishing cloth I got with my uke, with room to spare. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the picture does not accurately depict the item I received. My item is gray plush on the inside, and there is no strap to hold down the uke when in the case. Again, as other reviewers have remarked, there is a bit of room around my uke (Luna Floral Concert) so I will be putting a soft cloth in the case to make sure the uke doesn't bump around. In all, the case is good for the price, and the fact that it's so light but more protective than the gig bag that my uke came with is what prompted me to buy this item. I won't be returning it, and if you can live with the fact that you're probably not going to get the exact item pictured, then go ahead and buy it. I'm not disappointed.
