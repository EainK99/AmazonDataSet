I am trying these out on my Gibson SJ- they seem stable ,tuning wise and have a nice &#34; conventional &#34; tone esp. on the bass side. Not slippery like Elixirs.<br /><br />I only use coated strings due to durability - some players say it negatively affects tone , but I have not experienced that with these.
