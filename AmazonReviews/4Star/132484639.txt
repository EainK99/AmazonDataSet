This drum set is just the right size for my 4 year old. I wasn't sure of the quality but ordered by reading other reviews, and I am glad I bought it. Only missing piece in my package was instructions to assemble the drum set. I had to figure it out by watching similar drum set assembly on YouTube. Not sure if it was missing in our set or not included at all. But for first time drum set buyer like me instructions are very important. That's the reason for 4 stars or else the drum set is fab.
