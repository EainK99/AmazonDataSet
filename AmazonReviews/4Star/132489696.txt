As a portable amplifier the sound is exceptional but the piece that clips on the belt broke after having  squatted several times.I need to know how can I replace the broken part or if you can send to me the part.The button that makes contact to FM does not work well, pressing multiple times sank.Anyways I think that it is very helpful for teachers in very big classrooms or Physical Education teachers in open areas.It is helping me now.Please help me fix it.
