Bought this as a low cost pickup. Works well - has a warm sound and amplifies the resonance you want from an acoustic guitar. Sounds more natural than an undersaddle pickup. One draw back is it picks up a lot of noise from your finger movement and your arm against the guitar body. It takes about ten minutes to get used to.<br /><br />I installed this on a hundred dollar Alvarez dreadnought and play it for church worship.
