Nice sounding guitar.plenty og volume with the stock strings. Changed  to lighter strings and replaced plastic bridge for bone.lost some volume but sounds great now. Guitar had one hi fret and I  made some truss adjustments There were a few blemishes but who want a perfect blemish free guitar that sound like s***.  I  love the look of the maghogany red transparent finish  . There is not another guitar in this price range out there like this one
