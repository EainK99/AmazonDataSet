Seriously a solid microphone.<br /><br />I do a lot of amateur recording, and am slowly but surely mastering the art and I picked this up because I needed a solid Acoustic Guitar and Vocal mic (I have a slew of random mics, a snowball, an SM57, some lame Samson mics etc...) and I must say this mic (for the money) slays.<br /><br />The tone is noticeably warm, with a pronounced low end and a natural high end with the low end having a slight emphasis around 2-500khz. Which is nice, and helps to give vibrancy to quieter vocalists BUT it sometimes needs some EQ'ing to cut out some over emphasized frequencies. These over emphasized frequencies however, do roll off when you're about 1-2 feet away from the mic and CAN be useful even when you're right up in front of it, it just depends on the application. I have used the mic to record acoustic songs as well as some heavier music (Metal and Hardcore, primarily) and to my surprise, it handles &#34;harsher&#34; vocals pretty well (Not RIGHT in front of it obviously)<br /><br />All in all, I'm totally pleased with this mic. I honestly think that between this and the AudioTechnica AT2020 (another budget condenser) I'd chose the MXL V67G every time.<br /><br />WORD TO THE WISE: Buy a shock mount, the included &#34;stand&#34; is garbage.
