Purchased this kit off of Amazon and finished it two or three months ago...made a really nice guitar.  It plays and sound great.  I finished mine in a semi-transparent root beer with wipe-on poly.  I used Tru-Oil on the neck.  I've got about six or seven scratch builds under my belt so building the kit wasn't much of an issue.  I don't think a beginner would have any problems as long as you took your time and asked questions if you're unsure.  If you are a beginner, you are most likely to run into problems doing the finish...take your time there!<br /><br />About the only real problem I had was that the neck needed a shim to get the action down.  The neck is bolt on so the floor of the neck pocket is flat.  Guitars with wraparound (this one) or tune-o-matic bridges typically need the neck to have an angle greater than zero.  Shimming the back of the pocket with a folded business card did the trick.<br /><br />Hardware is a little on cheesy side, but it works just fine and you can replace it all later.  The P-90 pickup is just fine and there's no need to replace that.  No issues with the neck at all and once the frets were leveled and crowned, the guitar played like butter.<br /><br />Got a lease one person that wants to buy the guitar from me...not too bad!  I rated it a 4 because of the cheesy hardware.  Body and neck are a 5.
