I fully admit that I am lost when it comes to writing about many audio products. I am an audio consumer who is content with a great many things that seems to bother others. I just want to listen to my music and my audiobooks comfortably. These headphones manage both of those simple requirements. Since I seem to burn through ear/headphones at a rapid rate, either through loss or rough handling, another requirement is definitely a good price.<br /><br />I have really come to hate earbuds. I really don't like sticking them in my ear and have found them to become increasingly uncomfortable, so I have switched to headphones for several years now whenever I am going to listen to the I-Pod for more than 15 minutes. The last set of headphones I purchased cost more than twice what this pair costs and in a blind \\"taste test,\\" I honestly can't tell the difference between the two. My music sounds clear and great in both. I rarely use the equalizer function of the I-Pod because it burns up battery life, so what comes out is what I get and everything sounds pretty good to me in these Tascams. I would probably be blown away by how much better a set of headphones sound which cost several hundred dollars but I can say with reasonable certainty that I will never own a pair of those, so these are just the ticket.<br /><br />I have also found these headphones to be comfortable because they fit well on my big 7 3/4 size head. I have fallen asleep with these on and have slept for hours without any discomfort.<br /><br />Although I am not tuned in to the intricacies of audio listening, I can say with great confidence that these headphones are pretty good for the price and should make anybody who is looking for a reasonably priced alternative to earbuds pretty happy.
