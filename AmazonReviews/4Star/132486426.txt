The Xenyx Control1USB is quite a good piece of equipment that offers a reasonably priced alternative to the Mackie Big Knob, the industry 'standard' monitor controller for the home or project studio.  It offers all that the Mackie does (several inputs, several outputs, inter-room communication, etc.)  and then some (e.g. USB connectivity).  The housing is well constructed and noise levels are minimal.  My only gripe is that the 'big knob' is slightly scratchy when moved to and from the lowest level of volume.  Only time will tell whether Behringer quality control is sound or not. . . .
