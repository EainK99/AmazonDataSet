I'm 6'3\\", and this strap has plenty of adjustment.  Feels very secure on my guitar.  I liked it well enough I ordered a second (leather) one for another guitar. It's a nice alternative to strap locks, which often require modification of your guitar.  Works on all 5 of my guitars (ESP EC-1000, Hagstrom Super Swede, Wasburn Acoustic, Epiphone Masterbilt Acoustic, Ibanez S920), so outside some weird strap buttons, it will probably work with yours.
