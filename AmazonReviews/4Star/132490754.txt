Not much lacking and so far seems solid enough that it will last continued use. (not abuse) The padding is sufficient for my HD-500 and the outside pocket holds most of the support cables. Maybe nice to have an extra compartment for the power supply, but so far I can't really complain. And very happy to have the shoulder strap when lugging around 2 guitars!
