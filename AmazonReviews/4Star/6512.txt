I purchased these strings for a guitar that I keep strictly in Drop C and D standard. They definitely did the job and exceeded what I was expecting. This was the first time I've ordered from D'Addario, and I would definitely recommend them to guitar players. They hold up really well and they sound great. I know there are probably better strings for lower tunings out there, but for the price I think these work just fine.
