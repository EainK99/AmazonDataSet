Score! The headphones that I've been looking for for years.<br /><br />I fly a lot.  So much that I'm at the top tier (1K) of United's program.  I've never flown without some headphonese and I've gone through a good bit of them.  I'm always looking for noise cancelling due to spending so much time in the air.  In the past, I've always gone for active noise cancelling (the 535's are passive) with fair success.  In the past I've owned 3 different set's of sony's, the MDRNC13(Crap), Sony MDR-NC40 (great NC for the price), and their top-of-the-line MDR-1RNC (Overpriced and Overrated) and a set of the Sennheiser CXC 700's (decent).<br /><br />All of the above are Active Noise Cancelling which means they need a power source to activate the NC electronics.  A big drawback of the actives is that they require a battery and usually have a big bulky switch and battery compartment hanging somewhere on the cord (exception being the Sony 1RNC).<br /><br />The 535's, being passive, do not need the battery and thus are less bulky.  I've found that the passives also seem to cause less fatigue on my ears, except for the expandable foam in your ear canal that blocks out the external noise.  I want to try the custom fitted earpieces, maybe that will take care of that issue.  If fitted correctly, these 535's give me nearly the same level of noise blockage (technicaly Noise Isolation) from any other set I've ever used.  I haven't tried any of the other earpieces that came with this set - they may provide an even greater level of noise blockage.  However the reduction in noise level is good enough for me as shipped from the factory.<br /><br />Sound quality:  These phones bring my music to another level.  I hear things in music that I've never heard before.  Just listening to oldies that I've heard a thousand times like Hey Nineteen or FM by Steely Dan, to my hawaiian music like Iz Kamakawiwo`ole, is almost like re-introducing me to these songs.  Absolutely beautiful sound.  I can't say that about any other headphones I've owned which also includes non-NC types like Grado's and Bower's and Wilkins.<br /><br />I'm far from having the ears of an audiophile.  When I read some of the self-proclaimed experts and their descrips, I'm thinking \\"what?\\"  I really can't relate.  Good for them for having those ears, I don't have them.  But these are the first phones I've had that I can say \\"I've never heard anything like them.\\"  Last year I reviewed the New Sony active NC cans.  I paid about the same that I did for the 535's, and I was sorely disappointed (and wrote an Amazone review saying as much).  I'm so glad I came accross these phones, Hopefully these will be the last because I've spent a small fortune on headphones, maybe I'm finally done!<br /><br />Another positive thing to note is the carrying case that comes with these 535's.  The case is a nice looking hard case with a zipper.  Having a hard case is the best, especially for these very expensive small things.  You don't want them getting crushed or damaged like they could be from a bag or soft case.  A soft case came with my Bowers & Wilkins C5 in-ear headphones and it is so poorly exectuted (from engineering to manufacturing) that I can't even use it.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Made in China.<br /><br />Not the coolest looking things, almost looks like a medical device (I've got the clear, I think the Bronze or Red would look better).  However they look a lot better than that stupid looking \\"b\\" :-)<br /><br />They are a bit light on the bass, but that's not a biggie for me.<br /><br />Great job overall Shure!!!!
