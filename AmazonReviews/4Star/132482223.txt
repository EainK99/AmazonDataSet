i guess im a noob to the whole microphone recording process, but i definitely heard a difference in sound quality with this pop filter. Its nothing major like making your voice sound like pure gold or whatever, but its does make everything you say sound a good bit smoother. the clamp is pretty small so if you dont have a mic stand; i just fix it on the edge of my desk becuase i usually record on a computer. beware though, it did get on my nerves finding that sweet spot where it will tighten just right, its worked out. overall its a great product.
