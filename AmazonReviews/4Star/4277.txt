Great sound when dialed in properly. I do a lot of video for live musicians and it works very well but  it is extremely dependent on your position within a venue as how the sound is and the level of clipping required to get the most powerful, cleanest sound. Do not record at too low a level (LED's need to go into the red often) to get the best bass pickup in my experience. I haven't used the field recorder portion of the free iPhone app so I'll not comment on that other than to say in testing the sound was rather thin (lacking Bass) but that could have been the venue. Seems sturdy enough but if you have a hard case on your iPhone I doubt it will attach properly, purchase a flexible case if you intend to use it often. Mine's silicone and slips off the end pretty easily. Recommended.
