I like this a lot.  The bass is a little bit too loud and sometimes a bit distorted, but comparing this to the HD 201, which I ordered at the same time, this one is better.  Don't worry about the reviews saying it is not adjustable.  It is adjustable; you do it by pushing the earpieces up or down.  I recommend it.  However, I haven't owned it long enough to vouch for its longevity, and this is typically the problem I encounter with products ordered on-line.
