The sound is great, but there are two things that I wish were different:<br />1. I wish there was more cushion underneath the headband. After wearing them for a while the top of my head begins to get a bit sensitive. That might sound trivial, but I find myself shifting the headset slightly to relieve the pressure on the top of my head.<br />2. I thought that being an over the ear type unit it would insulate me from hearing distractions more than they actually do. I've tested noise-cancelling headsets and wasn't overly impressed with them either though.
