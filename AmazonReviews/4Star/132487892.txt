I drive a 2007 Miata convertible.  One of the very few problems with the car is that every once and a while the convertible roof drain clogs and causes water to back up into the passenger compartment.  This brush is the perfect fit for snaking into the drain and clearing the clog.  Repair at the dealership is PROHIBITIVELY expensive and after searching the internet and trying many different approaches this works wonderfully.
