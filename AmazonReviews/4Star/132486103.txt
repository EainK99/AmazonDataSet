Probably the best digital piano for the price. Very natural sounds, great keys.<br />The only con is that the audio out when plugged into a home av receiver ( a pretty powerful one) does not amplify the sound any. It seems like the voltage of the audio out is set for pa mixers and not home av equipment.
