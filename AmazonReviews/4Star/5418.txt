If you're a casual to intermediate musician and you're looking to do some decent drum recording for an affordable price, look no further. This kit has you covered on all the mics you'll need to successfully mic up your kit. I'll go over some things I like and don't like about it:<br />PROS<br />+ SEVEN mics for such a low price?? That's the main selling point right there.<br />+ For the most part, all mics sound very good for the price. And don't take that as in they're not that great cause it's a cheap set, because I was surprised with how well they sounded.<br />+ The carrying case that they come in is very small, compact, and convenient.<br />+ The clips that come with the mics can hook onto the rims of the drums, and it's a pretty sturdy hold. Our drummer played with his usual aggressiveness to test them out, and they didn't budge.<br />+ If you have some stands, I believe the two overheads and the kick mics can be screwed onto them. I just hung the overheads from the ceiling rafters though and used an old cymbal stand to angle the kick into the kick drum. Worked fine.<br />CONS<br />- The biggest complaint is the kick mic, and for good reason. It's hard to take that flappy cardboard sound out of it. You need to do some rigging up to get more attack or a beefy, fat sound. Not impossible, just hard. This is for more of a metal or rock sound though I guess, if you're doing lighter drumming it might not be as big of a concern for you.<br />- This is a small jab, but it'd be better if they came with cables. Especially because there are no value cable packs (that I'm aware of) that sell exactly 7 cables. That's not really fair to take away from my opinion of them though because it doesn't advertise as coming with them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great value that will help get you started into recording drums and you won't feel broke if you end up only using them casually or give up on music entirely. They're a great starting place. I mean you can buy single drum mics for double the price of this whole kit, but why do that if you're just testing the waters? Go on and jump in, the waters great.ics for double the price of this whole kit, but why do that if you're just testing the waters? Go on and jump in, the waters great.
