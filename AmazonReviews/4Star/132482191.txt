I just bought 3 pairs of these strings while they were on sale. The first pack I opened must have been sitting on the shelf for a while because they looked tarnished already. The strings didn't quite have that new string sound because of the tarnish, but they still sounded much brighter and clearer sounding than most of the strings I tried. The strings have been on my guitar for about 3 weeks now and they still sound the same. I usually have to change my strings every 1-2 weeks because my hands sweat a lot and are very oily. Overall I am still impressed by the strings even though it seems I received an old pack and will definitely buy them again. I will come back and review them again when I have to change the strings again hopefully my next set isn't tarnished also.
