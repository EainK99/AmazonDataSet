I purchased this item as an inexpensive backup in case I left my other one packed with another of my drum sets.<br />Well made & provides very good stick/mallet/brush protection. Be advised that the soft lining, while great for smooth finished  brushes, sticks & mallets, restricts easy removal of rubber coated ones.
