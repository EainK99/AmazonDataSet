Had these since August 2015. This is great for my Allen & Heath 10FX mixer, and my 2 mics, and some cables. I wish there was a little more space in it, so I could put my laptop in there too, but for carrying your cables and mixer and maybe a couple mics, this is a well made nice looking case. There are ZERO problems with this case. Its just like it was brand new and its been used frequently. You cannot go wrong with Gator cases period.
