I heard a lot about technical microphones and this doesn’t disappoint.  It arrived in a timely manner and it works really, really well.  Pros: the sound are crisp, the price is affordable, it comes with a built-in jack for earphones.  What I really like about this product is even though a brought a pop filter, I don’t need it. So yes It cost a little more than a cheaper version but the sound quality is amazing. Con: the only reason I haven’t gave this 5 stars it because you have to be really close and it’s not made for two people. I tried to record a youtbe video with someone else and after a test I notice the other person wasn’t picking up as much unless they came a little closer. Other than that it a great product.
