I'm giving this a tentative 4 star rating. Testing shows it's better than nothing but sound quality is not all that good. Of course it's dirt cheap, but for home videos, etc. It'll do. Not for any professional or even serious amateur use. You will likely have to adjust your cameras input settings. Try different ones, auto did not work very well for me.
