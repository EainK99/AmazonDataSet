I like this pretty well but it needs more quality control. I had to drill bigger holes in the frame so I could get the upright part to stand up all the way, The holes were off center in the upright part but it was easier to enlarge the holes in the frame base. It wouldn't even stand up by itself without a guitar in it holding it open by leaning the headstock on it.  Other than that I like it.
