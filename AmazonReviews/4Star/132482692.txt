If this had some clips to hold music books open, it would have been a five start item to me.  Even without the clips, it works great.  Much nicer than I expected for the price, so I ordered a second one.  Now we have 2.  One by the drum set, one for the saxophones.  I may wind up ordering a 3rd since I see nothing available that's better at this price.
