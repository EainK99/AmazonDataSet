I have kind of an odd perspective on this guitar because I bought mine broken from a thrift store. Someone had broken the neck off and dumped it off at a thrift store. (I handed over $4 for the carcass).<br />The attachment of the neck is not the same as most guitars. This one uses a couple of wooden dowels instead of an interlocking dovetail type joint. That joint had failed on mine. I used some Gorilla Glue and a large carpenters clamp to get it back together.<br />Looking over the whole guitar the shortcuts in finishing are pretty obvious. More expensive guitars are so flawless. This one shows several nicks and even saw marks that were not eliminated prior to painting. From 6 feet away though, it looks fine. Up close - not so nice. I wouldn't say ugly. Just a lot of character.<br />The rest of the guitar is a bit lightly built (less internal bracing on the top and back). I think this was done to save cost of course but I think it gives this guitar much of its nice resonance. It does have a very pleasant sound. The wood for the top, back and sides appears to be some grade of pine or boxwood. Light gauge strings are a must for this guitar. A heavy set of strings would require higher string tension that would crush this guitar.<br />Some of the frets are a bit uneven. And the paint on them is pretty gross (there really shouldn't be any paint on a guitars frets). I don't mind cleaning stuff and making adjustments with a metal file on the frets. Not a big deal.<br />Action (distance between strings and the top of the frets/fret board) is pretty high. Some tinkering on the action to suit your own personal taste happens with just about any guitar though.<br />This guitar has some limitations and lacks the finish of more expensive guitars but I believe it does deliver a solid value for the asking price.
