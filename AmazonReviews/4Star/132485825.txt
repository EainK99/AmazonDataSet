I got these to light up an Burning Man art installation at night, I got them because it was DC current and so I could attach them to a battery. I ended up hooking it up to a battery pack over a deep cell for cost reasons, using a pack and some wiring help from my local EL-wire distributer. worked great for my need! sticky backing wasnt necessarily what i needed, used some zip-ties to secure it in the desert.  I gave it 4 stars because i ordered 'weatherproof' and it didn't come to me as the weatherproof version, but it still worked fine for the week in the desert.
