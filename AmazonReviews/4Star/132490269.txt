If you are a parent looking to buy a stand for your young musician, this is a great deal ! I bought a more expensive model but my son &#34;can't find it&#34; ( you know how that goes?  probably left it in the band room!) so I wasn't in the mood to put out much money for another one. This one is sturdy, good looking, and gets the job done at a great price.  It came as promised w/ bag and is not flimsy like some other inexpensive models I've seen. I only gave it 4 stars bec if you are looking for a fancy, super heavy duty stand this is not it.  But if I had to do it over again, I would have gotten this one the first time and skipped the high-end stand.
