this review is contributed to the world of iphone5s owners who want to make good quality videos with the 5s with good quality sound.<br />i absolutely hate poor audio quality in home made videos.<br />this review is my attempt at making a dent in the world of good sound+video quality home videos with the iphone 5s.<br /><br />i was hesitant that only one channel would work, but the audio comes out of both Left and Right speakers, it's just not stereo.<br /><br />TESTING UPDATE: so for recordings with the mic on my 5s, the volume is very, very low.  the quality is very good, but if you turn up the volume on the player all the way, and turn up the volume on your computer all the way, the volume is still very low.  if you play the video on the 5s with the onboard speaker, then the volume is acceptable.  again, not super loud.  it will definitely never get too loud.  seems like there should be more amplification or gain in the mic.  technically speaking, i don't really know the difference between adjusting those two settings via the mix of electronics and battery power available.  i just know that the playback volume needs to be higher.  i will have to make some more videos to see where i truly stand with this mic.  BUT after all, it is only a $20 mic :)<br /><br />i originally wrote this review elsewhere.  i copied and pasted it:<br /><br />i'm pretty darn happy with my purchase!  i just got the iphone 5s adapter and i tested it with the new lavaliere mic i got from amazon.com.<br /><br />the mic i got was the Audio-Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone for ~$20. (available on prime).<br /><br />the adapter i got was the KM-IPHONE-MIC.<br />$29 including s&h.<br /><br />i bought the adapter online with no problems from kvconnection.com and it got here very quickly.  which is awesome because i am in seattle.  and this little adapter shipped out of Kitty Hawk, NC... the state where i grew up!<br /><br />i miss being being to drive down for a daytrip to the beach at Wrightsville Beach.  real beaches in the summer with hot and humid weather and warm sand.<br />back to the real story...<br /><br />so far so good!  i figure that with the $20 lav mic from amazon, and this $29 adapter (it looks to be home made as far as i can tell, so i will use it gently so that it doesn't pre-maturely break) i can make semi-professional quality digital videos.<br /><br />one of my absolute biggest annoyances with homemade videos that are decently made VISUALLY, is the HORRIBLE AUDIO that usually goes along with it.<br /><br />now with my $49 in a mic+adapter invested, i should have pretty darn good quality videos!<br /><br />now all i need the $3k dream machine i have been passionately pining over for the last year: a 15\\" retina macbook pro!!!
