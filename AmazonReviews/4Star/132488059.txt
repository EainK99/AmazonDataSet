Effective on the airplane.  I also like the sound quality of these SE215-CL, but after I wear them for a long time my ears begin to hurt.  Additionally the way the ergonomics work on these headphones the wire has to wrap around your ear.  I find that it never really stays fully in place, especially if your the type that has an active lifestyle. I find myself constantly fidgeting around with the wire to get it in the right place.
