changing the battery out is a bit of a pain, but it works very well, fits in the pick & string box in my guitar case, & is fairley noisless thru my old Crate CA60 acoustic amp.  on the minus side it is heavy & made out of plastic.  im not a 'stomper' so so far no troubles.<br />for the price i paid, it does the job well & thats all i asked of it.<br />if i had the money i wouldve bought a fishman or some such that would be smaller & lighter but i live off what goes into the jar where i play (& a little disability) so i think its a very good deal
