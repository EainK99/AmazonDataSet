This guitar came in pretty quick. Now first off the neck and body and the pickups are beautiful. Sounds better than my MIM Stratocaster. I put new strings on it right away so can't tell you much about the ones it came with. It has a fake bigsby tremolo system with actually performs almost just as well as the real thing. I'm satisfed. Now the only issue I had with it is that on the 3 way switch. It seems someone at the factory forgot to put a nut on the switch so I had to salvage one at a local music ship but other than that this is an amazing buy!. The shipping price kinda sucks though
