I have never owned an electric guitar.  I have a 40 year old acoustic piece of wood that thinks it's a guitar, but haven't played it much.  I got this kit for a learning experience and didn't want to spend a bushel on an electric guitar.  This unit certainly fills the bill!<br /><br />This kit is perfect for a beginner or someone like me who has played previously and needs a refresher.  The guitar is a very good copy of the Fender Stratocaster and sounds like one to boot!  Fit and finish is very good and the wood parts were not warped or discolored.  My copy came completely out of adjustment but a few Youtubes later and a screwdriver, all was right with the world.  The amp is a very small unit suitable for practice only with no bells or whistles.  The accessories are of lesser quality than the guitar but will serve the purpose till you can get better ones.<br /><br />If this kit came with some kind of guitar tuner, I would have given it an extra star.<br /><br />IMHO, you cannot go too wrong with this kit but you may need to have the guitar set up by a music shop (+-$40) or just do it yourself.  It's not that hard to do.  Most new guitars need to be properly set up anyway regardless of cost.  The supplied pickups are single coil but seem to be pretty good.<br /><br />Recommendations:  Change the factory strings to a higher quality (I got the Ernie Ball Super Slinky).  Change the two string hold down clamps (string trees) at the tuning board to \\"roller trees\\". (both sell for cheap on Amazon)  Then you will have as close to a Stratocaster as you can get minus about 800 bucks!<br /><br />Rock on!!!
