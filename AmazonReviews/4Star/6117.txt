I am new to these. I wasn't really sure what I was going to get, or how it would sound.<br /><br />Initially it sounded too twangy with the strings making a horrible noise. After watching a few YouTube videos, and applying some masking tape to the &#34;bad&#34; string, it sounds much better. I then unscrewed a little the top corners to get a good snap sound on the corners. So, snap, snare and base sounds all there. I am happy.<br /><br />So, now all I need to do is learn to play. That alas will be a much longer journey.
