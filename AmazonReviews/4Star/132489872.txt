I purchased this slide to use on my pinky with a National &#34;O&#34; resonator. The gauge of brass was to thin to be effective, could not get enough tone. However, to be fair to &#34;Rock Slide&#34;, only been using light gauge strings. Medium gauge is better for slide. .<br />In the past, I always played slide on my ring finger like &#34;Duane&#34;; Trying to transition to my pinky to have other fingers more available for chords.<br />It is a nicely designed product...
