A crisp sounding, well balanced set. They have a decent life, and maintain a consistent sound throughout. Depending on how much you play, you should change your strings every month, and these will stay bright that whole time. They will become a little duller sounding after that month, but will maintain their tuning and durability for much longer than that, if you're not trying to impress anybody.<br />These are definitely my go-to strings for practice and personal use, but when I'm performing, it's Hannabach all the way.
