I bought this gig bag for traveling with my Alesis Midi Q49 on vacations. I've got to keep up with my piano practice..:)<br />It's a well built bag and like someone said it has no shoulder strap. The bag and carrying handles are very well padded and the bag itself is &#34;very&#34; roomy. Its way too roomy for my Q49. That was disappointing. The only way to take up the space is to put the keyboard in it's original box then put it in the bag. Oh, well. The good part is if I do a bag check the keyboard will be well protected and also as I grow to use more sophisticated Midi keyboards with more bells and whistles I probably wont have to buy another bag. So I think its a good deal.
