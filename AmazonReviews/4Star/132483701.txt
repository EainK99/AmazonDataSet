The quality was acceptable for the price.  The bass guitar looks good.  The bass is fretless, but it has fake plastic fret lines, which I do not like.<br /><br />If you are an electric fretless bass player, you may be disappointed by the low volume and sound quality of this guitar when used without an amp.  The volume is somewhat less than a conventional acoustic guitar -- just to set expectations.  Of course, strong bass requires a much larger box (like a standup bass).  That said, I found it to be adequate, if marginal, when playing with several other people (guitar, mandolin, banjo).  If you are playing with other acoustic folks who hate electric instruments, this is a viable choice; but probably not adequate for a stage performance when un-amplified.<br /><br />The built-in electronic tuner works and is probably accurate enough, but I do not think it is as accurate as other tuners I have used.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it did not fully meet my expectations, yet the price was attractive.
