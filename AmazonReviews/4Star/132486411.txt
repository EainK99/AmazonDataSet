Luna ukuleles are well worth the money invested. This is the second one that I've bought and I've not been disappointed. ( I gave the first one away to a young niece who is just learning to love the uke.) Luna, while unfortunately choosing to produce their laminate ukuleles in China, puts a lot of thought into their designs. They add lovely little touches to enhance the appearance of their instruments. I particularly love the &#34;lunar phases&#34; on the fretboard. The sound, once the strings break in, is sharp and clear. The ukulele is well assembled and a delight to play. Of course, it can't compete with solid wood ukes, but it does very well for a fraction of the price. If you are looking for a first uke, or just something to drag along to the beach, go ahead and order your favorite Luna design. You can't go wrong.
