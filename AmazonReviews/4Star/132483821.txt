Nice strings. Great sound.<br />But rust easy.<br /><br />I had issues with the packaging. I used only 1 string and the rest rusted in the paper jackets.<br />You have to use all of the strings once opened.<br /><br />The cheapo Musician's friend strings don't have these issues - they are individually wrapped in plastic jackets and I don't have to use all of them at one go.
