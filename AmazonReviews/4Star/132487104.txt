I'm not able to give a full review since I only ordered these to replace my neck pickup. Anyways, They came bubble wrapped from china in a small box. First thing I found when I opened it were 2 pickups already attached to their frames. They weren't individually wrapped which explains why there's some deep scratches on one of them. Not exactly happy but I only needed one of them anyway. These pickups do not come labeled bridge or neck so I guess both work either way. Easy to install, standard 2 wire stuff. The pickup is really really warm. Lots and lots of bass on clean. Its muddy when distorted, I got a grunge sort of sound from it when palm muting and such. Anyway, worth my money even though I'm only using one of them.
