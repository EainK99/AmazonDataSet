These straps are very well made, heavy duty, and the splashed-paint design is very original and looks great. I only use cotton straps because they let you position the guitar how you want and it stays put. The only complaint with this particular one is that the ends are square, not rounded. I'm nit-picking because the ends are very heavy-duty, but personally I would rather they have been rounded off rather than square. It didn't stop me from buying it, and it's the second LM Scraps strap I've bought. Highly recommended.
