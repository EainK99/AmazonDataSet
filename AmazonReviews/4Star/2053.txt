The one I got was well in tune (within 1/100 cent), and still is, over a year later. Compare its sound to a 440hz sine wave and you'll hear very VERY little intermodulation between the two. I've used it to tune guitars and such, where it did well. Its sound lasts long enough to sample a good sustained tone for musical applications.
