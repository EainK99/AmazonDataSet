First the tuner part... I tuned my guitar using this. I then compared it to my real tuner -- the guitar was off a little. However, the Tcapo is adjustable so I can adjust the setting each time I use it (Chrono mode) I suggest you tune your guitar using a known reliable tuner and then adjust the tuner to the guitar so you know how to compensate the Tcapo each time. Hard to explain. The Tcapo was set at 432, but it was off. If I set it to 439, that is perfect and it matches my other tuners. The part I like about the tuner is that it picks up vibration, not sound. You have to have it clamped to the guitar or it won't work, but that way, it don't pick up other instruments.<br /><br />The capo part was perfect, not to hard or soft... seems to be built solidly. Should last a long time.
