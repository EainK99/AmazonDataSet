Easy to use, just plug in to your USB port and go. It is quite a bit bigger than I had expected -- I think Softball size. I bought this mic for a voice over job and was complemented on how clear and free of pops my resulting audio was -- and this was not with any expensive software, just the free Audacity. A must have for voice recording.
