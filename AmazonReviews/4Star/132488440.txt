I would give it 5 stars but I feel like you should get a really decent sound for almost 300 bucks. I'm used to hearing a nice Yamaha digital piano make real piano sounds. It sounds decent with other tones. I recommend this to someone who needs speakers on a keyboard but then again I would rather just plug a midi keyboard into a laptop into speakers. You can get way more sounds on a computer and its easier to find the sound your looking for. This keyboard seem like old technology to me. I rate it a 4 star considering this is what your really looking for
