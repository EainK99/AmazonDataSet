I purchased these sticks because I wanted to use them during a youth group retreat. When I first got them, they were pretty cool because they are touch sensitive and only light up when I striked it. I used them onstage and let me say...they were crowd &#34;wowers&#34; and I received lots of praise from people about how cool they looked. However, just like many reviews about them already, they don't feel like wooden Vic Firth sticks. The feel of the sticks are quite rigid and flexy.  I'd say wooden sticks are still louder on the snare and the three toms, but for cymbals, both sticks dynamics are about the same. Also, as I was crashing on the Zildjian 18' K Crash Cymbal, my firestix became dented from playing the crash moderately hard (Look below at picture). In conclusion, these sticks are not made for heavy playing and onstage performances over a long period of time.
