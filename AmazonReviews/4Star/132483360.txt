This came with a gig bag, power supply, head phones and instruction booklet.<br /><br />What I love is the full size fret board and classical realistic sound / action.  It is versatile and handy to practice without disturbing others.  And it looks cool!  Sounds best to my mind on reverb 1.<br /><br />Only two gripes would be the headphones - so have replaced with my own.  The body is a bit slim and also cannot use A-frame rest, so have to use foot rest which strains my back.<br /><br />Has it been a good purchase. Yes! It is by far ahead of other silent guitars I've tried. Buy it.
