Bought this to replace a stiff, plastic jacketed cable. I wanted something with an angle connector and with a flexible hand and tough cover. This item fits the bill at a good price. Works, looks, feels, sounds perfectly fine. Only little niggle is with straight 1/4 phone plug. It must be on the small side of the tolerance as it is loose in whatever I plug it into, amp, box, guitar.
