I had initially ordered another product - [[ASIN:B007X968RA B007X968RA]] This other product has the same picture posted on their sales page with a different brand logo on it. So i thought that the other product is the same china made stuff from a different seller. Why not pay less from them then pay the higher prices for this one. So I boght it and it was horrible. I was not working from out of the box. I returned the other product and purchased this and the quality is much better<br />The only I did not like in this product is that if you want to attach more lights, they do not provide connectors on the other end. the other end is open wires and you have to spend the extra money to buy connectors for it.
