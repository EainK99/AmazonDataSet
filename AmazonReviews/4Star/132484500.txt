I've used all sorts of capos, from a pencil and rubber bands to an assortment of clamp-on, screw-on, strap-on, commercial capos. This one has to be the neatest and most convenient of any I've used. A flick of the lever, and it's on or off.<br /><br />I did encounter a problem on one of my guitars. It's a 1930s vintage Bruno with a V neck shape. This capo doesn't fit well on the V neck and tends to unlatch itself spontaneously. I was able to improve it considerably by a little judicious bending of the capo but it's still a bit dicey. I may try further improvement.
