Has a airy/breathy quality that most whistles don't have.  I think most people will love it or hate it because of that.  Volume in the upper octave is surprisingly quiet.  Has a bit of a wooden sound (it uses a wood block) which I like.  I find the lower notes in the upper octave a little hard to get the breath pressure right.<br /><br />Overall a nice sound and different from your typical (generation/feadog) sound, but it won't be replacing my Sweetone anytime soon.
