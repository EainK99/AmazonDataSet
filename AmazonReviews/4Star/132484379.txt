I have had several pop filters over the years.  This one is dual layer, with about 1/2&#34; between them, and each layer is very thin.  It does not completely stop pops if you are closer than 4&#34; or so and singing directly into the capsule.  However, if you back up a bit or sing a little off axis, it does stop pops, protects your capsule from spit, and is quite transparent.  I am very impressed with the transparency, hence the 4 stars.  The arm is weak and it does not hold, but I have never had one that held very well.  This would be a great filter if they invested a little more in a good arm.
