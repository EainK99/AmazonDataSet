When hooked up to a sound system (with someone controlling a board) this pickup performs as well, if not better, than the traditional bridge-style pickup, with the added benefit of not gouging your bridge. Durability may be an issue due to the cable being built into the pickup and the thinness of the cable, but for the price it's easy to order a few backups.<br /><br />I use this pickup on a full-sized viola and am able to get a great range of tone, but in the low-mid range the sound is phenomenal. I have tried it on my violin with fair results, but the low range of the violin sounds a bit muddy with this pickup.<br /><br />I have not tried this plugging in directly to an amp as other reviewers have tried, so I can't comment on the sound quality in a non-optimized environment.
