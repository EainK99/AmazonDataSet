I purchased this kit as it seemed to have everything I needed and the shipping was as quick as was needed.  I am a beginner to the bagpipes but wanted to get a quality practice chanter as I am serious about learning.  After using for a few weeks I can say the chanter is of excellent quality for a poly.  The reed included is a Lee plastic reed.  The reed was not impressive and takes a lot of effort.  I replaced right away with a quality reed and it made a huge difference.  The book is nice and is an updated version of the book I was told to get by my instructor.  The case is a nice thought but not really that awesome.  Seems kind of tacky and flimsy.  I would recommend the chanter but would more strongly recommending ordering directly for just the chanter.  Not really that great of a deal.
