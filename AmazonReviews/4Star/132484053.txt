I recently refurbished an early 70's Ovation Country Artist and needed a new case.  I don't travel a lot with the guitar, so the main function of a case for me is to store the guitar, be able to easily move it from room to room, and keep it reasonably safe.  This case does that very well.  I don't think it would offer the same protection as a hard case, though it is well cushioned and properly contoured inside for the Ovation bowl, and firmer than any other soft cases I've seen.  It is surprisingly light weight - a nice surprise.  The zippers work well, though one has to take care to make sure the lid strap folds in properly and doesn't get caught in the zipper.  Storage pockets are more than adequate for some papers, music, etc, and extra strings, picks, a small tuner.  I don't plan on using the back straps, so can't fairly comment on those.  This was a bit more costly than a gig bag, but this is much more of a case than a gig bag.  Unless you are traveling on a plane, or like to throw your guitar around, this case should offer reasonable protection for any Ovation with a deep or mid depth bowl.
