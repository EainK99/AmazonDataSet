These are not only great for floral arrangements but also great as note holders like shown in my picture.  It super easy to use.  My only complaint is that the plastic is a little thin.  I tried placing a note card in one and accidentally broke it.  But that could've just been me being heavy handed.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
