Good:<br />Broad range of patches available<br />Audio file player built in, so you can play (and sing) with accompaniment tracks<br />3.5mm input so you can merge MP3 player tracks with your live performance. Saves you a channel on the mixer, or if you're going wireless, one wireless system<br />Battery powered<br />Small size<br />Full size velocity sensitive keys<br />Built-in Vocal Scat patch<br /><br />Bad:<br />Difficult to quickly change audio track playback volume<br />Patches are only slightly modifiable<br />You can only store 12 commonly used patches for quick access.  All the others are available, but time consuming to recall.  Not something you'd want to do on a gig<br />Display is limited to 3 quasi-alphanumeric digits. Could make it difficult if you're scrolling through long lists of audio files.<br /><br />How I use it:<br />* Single entertainer, playing it through a wireless, along with bg tracks while singing and strolling through small to medium sized restaurant for customers.<br />* Horn player, using AX09 as second instrument in band, w/kbd on X stand. Much lighter and smaller than full sized synth<br /><br />Very bad:<br />In daylight, the mod bar will false trigger. I contacted Roland, who knows about this issue. Their only solution is to shade the kbd.  This is specifically not an overheating problem: you can momentarily shade the mod bar, and the problem will go away (until you take your hand away.). Important to note that any stage lighting will NOT trigger this problem: only bright daylight.<br /><br />This kbd is not for everyone: if you need its features it's a godsend.
