This is a good microphone, and I really like the heft of it and the sound that it produces.<br /><br />The stand is well constructed and easy to use.  It will tip over its own stand if you don't put one leg directly underneath the microphone.<br /><br />I got the microphone mostly for voiceovers on videos and for clarity in the webinars that I host.  I wanted a &#34;stand mic&#34; for my desk.  And it does a good job at that.  But there is not a convenient way to attach it to my older mic stands for when I am standing.  I haven't figure that one out yet.<br /><br />I was able to use it with my iMac and Garage band immediately, there were no compatibility issues of any kind.<br /><br />This little mic is perfect for my needs.
