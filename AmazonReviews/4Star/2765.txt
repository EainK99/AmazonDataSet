These heart picks are very nice and I really like their idea, now you can put a lovely note clearly and in a stylish way inside any flower pocket or even fruits pocket, as it is tall (about 2 times the length of a pen) and it can be inserted easily with its pointed end into foam or cabbage. They have a nice shape and being clear is good not to cover any part of the inserted card. They work great as they hold cards very well. Their plastic material is good, they came attached together and the sites of attachments have some defects but these sites will not appear in the pocket. I received this product discounted in exchange of my honest unbiased review.
