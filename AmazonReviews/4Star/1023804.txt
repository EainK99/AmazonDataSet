All in all this violin is a good purchase, the case is magnificent and the bow is decent quality. My only qualm is the fact that the pegs do slip occasionally and you have to retune the violin, then again that is also just the nature of peg tuning instruments. I would definitely recommend this violin for beginners or people who are looking for a decent practice violin.
