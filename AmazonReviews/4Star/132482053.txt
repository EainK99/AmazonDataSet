One thing about this controller, is that to properly map ALL the controls in ALL 4 banks, you need to use 2 midi channels.  Other than that, it is easy to program and is a good controller.  The faders are a bit loose feeling and don't give you any resistance.  But the thing is ridiculously cheap, so it is expected that the controls be a little less solid feeling than some other controllers.  Very good product.
