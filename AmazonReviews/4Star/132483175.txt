We already knew this was a great brand of music stand (strong, stable, easy to adjust on the fly), but the color options are new.  I was wondering, so I will tell you: the color coating is shiny, not matte.  The red is great, and having a color makes it look better sitting out in the living room like it always will.  I have hardwood floors and had to place a second order for the soft vinyl feet covers so maybe order yours at the same time (they not only protect the floors when your kid tries to drag the music stand toward her, but also the walls when someone carries the stand to another room).  Our package came without any assembly instructions, but Manhasset has easy to find written and video instructions on their website.  Assembly was just a handful of steps but it does require a 11/16 wrench and flat head screwdriver.
