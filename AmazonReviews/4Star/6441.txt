Room for small accessories, but if you put something like a DI box on it, there's no room for a drink (which is probably not a good idea to put on this anyhow), and maybe picks and capo.  Not to sure how useful the mic attachment will be, it's at an awkward angle and not adjustable, but still a nice touch. I can add a gooseneck if needed.<br />Attaches to thick or thinner part of my mic stand, which is a plus, looks like it will fit most stands.<br />The tray itself is very sturdy, but I'm not sure how long the clamp will hold up. There's only about 1/2&#34; of clamp area that attaches the the stand, wish they'd make the clamp part wider to spread out the pressure more, I have to tighten it a lot to fit securely. If it is to stay fixed on a stand it should be fine, but for travel it's better to take it off, which takes longer than needed. It seems a quick release spring loaded arrangement would make it a lot quicker to get on and off.<br />The plastic washer on the clamp fell out right off the bat, I had to glue it back in, wasn't too impressed by that, and it seems like it will break pretty easily if over tightened. The clamp should still work, but it will then scratch your mic stand.
