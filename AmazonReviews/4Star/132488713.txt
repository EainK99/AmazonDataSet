This fuzz must be used with power chors and soloing .... It has a senstive octave up so with the correct settings you can have Jimi Hendrix Winterland sound. In his playing you will notice (Purple Haze) the same sound when playing full chords.<br />I give it 4 stars because you cant adjust the fuzz with your guitar volume so its complicated to play a song that has full chords, light solos combined with heavy fuzzy solos.<br />For the $$$ its ok.
