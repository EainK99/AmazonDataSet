Well, overall this is a good product, but it does have the feel of the \\"fake\\" material that it is. Still for the price I would recommend this slipover for anyone who was on a budget. My daughter did raise angora rabbits so I did have an advantage in using some of that harvested fur for a cover, but not everyone has a daughter that will comb her rabbits hair to harvest the wonderful fur. I would say this slipover does the job for which it is intended.
