This is an impressively bright LED light. It’s easily visible in a lit room, and shines (literally!) in a dark room. It’s simple to use: just plug it into a wall outlet. There are no moving parts, and it’s totally silent when operating. Energy use is minimal, with the light consuming only 10 watts.<br /><br />The build quality is OK for the price. It’s an all-plastic housing, and is made of somewhat cheap feeling plastic. There’s a cord channel in the base, but it’s cut too shallow and is only moderately  effective at keeping the cord managed. There are keyhole slots on the back if you wanted to mount this permanently (or semi-permanently). Screws are not provided.<br /><br />It runs on a random pattern that puts out a nice light show with no noticeable pattern repeats unless you pay really close attention. However, while this is billed as having “voice response” it does not sync or mirror music – I didn’t notice any difference in the patterns when using it in a quiet room, a room with a lot of conversation, or a room with music playing. So, if it actually does have “voice response” it’s very subtle.<br /><br />The cord is short – only about 3 feet. A little longer cord would have been better, and would make this easier to position without having to resort to an extension cord.<br /><br />The negatives brings my rating to 4 stars but this remains a fun light, especially for kids, with very bright output and a low energy draw.<br />[Sample provided for review]
