Can't complain.  The last tuner I had I gave away to a young guy that was just learning guitar.  When my own son decided to learn I needed a another tuner.  This one works great.  I always used the old analogs before but this one duplicates the functions digitally fairly well.  The ONLY gripe is the LCD display is difficult to read unless you can position it just so.  But this is the nature of LCDs.
