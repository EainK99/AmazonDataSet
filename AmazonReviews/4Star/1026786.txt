The Sonic Stomp Phase correction box worked very well for me, With small low wattage amps having a am radio mid tone sound the Stomp set with dials back gave the amp a Hi Fi sound, The bass boost signal seems to be independent or split from the treble boost, Very fat muddy distorted chords can be set along with notes/Riffs and still get a unified articulate sound. this also extends the amps and effects range of sounds, Now for a large 4-10 amp/cab I was not able to get much of a change in sound The Sonic Stomp acted more like a Bass/Treble booster, I had to move around the dials quite a bit to get some clarity. over all The sonic Stomp does what the ads say. Like any effect its not good for all applications, But it will get a clean bright sound when you need it.<br />For me I like to use it most of the time with the smaller amps.... and it came with the wall adapter.
