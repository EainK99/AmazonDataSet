We purchased this for my daughter for her eighth birthday party with some girl friends of hers.  To say they had fun is an understatement.  It has been used a lot.  We have only one CDG disc but the kids will put other CDs in and sing along on the mic, or play music on the media player while singing along.  The sound through the speaker was surprisingly good, and certainly room filling.  The CRT screen is old-school, circa early 2000s.  You can adjust its picture using a knob on the back.  Honestly, most people won't use it; the target audience know the lyrics already.  It hooked up easily to our video-switching amp for a test run but every since it has been used standalone.  It seems solid and has two recesses for carrying about.  Its not perfect, and took a bit of time to figure out all the knobs, but does what it promises.  It has already provided its money's worth in fun for the family.  It was well worth the money and is recommended by our family.  Update 1/28/2017- Over three years later and this system still works great.  The sponge/mesh covering of the microphone has been the only part that doesn't look as good as the day it showed up.  The kids have liked to pull it off, so no fault of the product.  This really was a great value.  It has been used more as a &#34;boom box&#34; than for karaoke and the sound quality has been good.
