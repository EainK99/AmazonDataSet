Like the other reviewer, I find this is overall an excellent product, BUT.  The sleeve is a fat, mushy plastic that just doesn't accommodate certain cymbals.  Sabian no problem.  But Paiste, Zildjian, Bosphorus?  Es problemo.  NOT the kind of nonsense you want to deal with post-gig.  I finally just had to toss it -- trying to pack up after just the second gig.  What might work is: (HUMES & BERG ARE YOU LISTENING?) a cymbal sleeve made of harder plastic and TAPERED AT THE TOP to allow for easy insertion.  Of the cymbals, of course.  It's like they made this without field-testing it.
