This guitar stand does the job for holding my guitars. Although it says it can hold 7 guitars.... My stand feels full with three electrics and an acoustic. If I did have 7 guitars I wouldn't like having them so close. The directions to put this stand together were terrible, and mine came with one of the bars being slightly bent. This stand does fold for easy transportation if that is important to you, but because it folds it is more flimsy in my opinion. I would recommend getting this if you had two guitars minimum. With only one guitar on the stand, the stand still wiggles a bit when touched. The more guitars you have on it the more stable it is. My guitars on average cost me $325 each. If my guitars were more expensive I would probably look elsewhere for a guitar stand... maybe one more sturdy. However, this does the job for me and it makes my room look much more organized and pretty.
