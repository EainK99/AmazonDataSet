The omni directional mic is great. I would rather have had two of those as opposed to a cardioid mic and the omni mic. The cardioid mic picks up obviously a larger directional range and therefore noise. However, even with that, they both sound great and are not wonky or hollow sounding so post production is easy and smooth.
