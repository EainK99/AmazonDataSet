The best guitar i've ever owned. Previously, i've had a Kramer Pacer (or Baretta?), an American Stratocaster, Paul Reed Smith Custom 24, a Schecter, and most recently, a Les Paul Studio 50s Humbucker. This EVH, though, is the most playable of all of them - possibly alongside the PRS - and sounds best. It really 'sings.' Fantastic tonality and sustain.<br /><br />I love the unfinished neck. The body is shaped beautifully and is comfortable. The binding is lovely... paint, knobs, tuners, etc. -- all beautiful.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />The 'reversed' pickup switch thing is annoying. Regardless of how Eddie likes it, i'm not sure why we, the talentless masses, need our guitars to be so specifically emulative of what EVH plays.<br /><br />I don't love the headstock shape. But, that's just a personal, aesthetic matter. Same with the \\"EVH\\" logo. I'm a graphic designer, and, let's say i'm 'particular.'<br /><br />Unfortunately, the guitar was made in China. I didn't realize that until after i had tested one in a store and then decided to buy it instead of a Strat HSS. I have no qualms with the quality and workmanship here. I DO, though, have issues with China's dishonest trade practices which infringe on intellectual property. See, also, the recent stories on corporate theft and espionage.... Just prior to this purchase, i had made a resolution to avoid Chinese-produced goods. Wish i could have adhered at this time, but i'll just have to begin... NOW.<br /><br />The Floyd. Well, as a review above advises, know what you're getting into with a Floyd. Tuning it is not fun. And, don't expect to change tunings at whim. That said, i've got mine tuned down a half, as i bought this specifically to entertain myself by playing Van Halen songs. Don't buy the Floyd version if you're going to want to cover songs at standard tuning AND want to drop down for VH (and the like) material.<br /><br />I have not yet gotten the D-Tuna to operate properly, but i imagine i'm just doing somethingwrong. I did the tuning adjustment (down a half) myself -- the procedure with the springs and then the locking nut, and perhaps i didn't compensate for the D-Tuna. I will figure it out when i get the guitar professionally set up. Not that the guitar needs a setup, otherwise. It feels and sounds great, out of the box.<br /><br />The volume and tone pots. Not loving them. Too sharp of a transition. There ought to be more of a gradual roll-off. Not sure if i can do anything about that. I certainly don't want to do anything that might affect the guitar's/pickups' tone.<br /><br />Likes:<br />The pickups sound great. Not sure what the relationship is to the separately available EVH Frankenstein, but they do give me the Brown Sound, something i was unable to achieve with previous guitars, including the Les Paul. Tuning down a half step is probably a pretty significant measure toward that, as well.<br /><br />The guitar came with a very solid ABS plastic (?) flight case. Very substantial. Very much appreciated. Especially considering i received only a cheap-ish nylon gig bag with the Les Paul....<br /><br />Bottom line -- i definitely recommend this instrument. The PRS i owned was more expensive, and exuded quality at every turn. It was well finished in gorgeous transparent black, and all the hardware and electronics were perfect. It was quite 'playable,' but didn't have THIS sound. The Les Paul had a Les Paul sound, but i've always felt LPs were a bit 'primitive' in feel. The Strat was a Strat. No faults there.... But, the EVH -- i can't remember ever enjoying playing a guitar this much. That, alone, is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />[I'd like to rate this a 4.5. Only the sharp ramp of the volume pot lets the guitar down, and aside from using it on \\"Somebody Get Me a Doctor,\\" i don't think it's much of an issue.]
