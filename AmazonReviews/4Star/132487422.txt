This drum key is very good. It fits perfectly into the lugs. It has a nice heavy yet light feel. And best of all you can hang it with your keys and take it everywhere you go. You can change the drum key with any other drum key by simply opening the little pouch that holds the key. I love it.. I was in need of another drum key and this one was perfect for that. I would give it 5 stars but I payed for it to get here from 2-6 days and it took about two weeks to get here, but as long as I got it, that doesn't matter.. The key is perfect. HIGHLY recommended for all drummers!
