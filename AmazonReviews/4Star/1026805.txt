Apparently there's a manufacturers defect with some MXL 770 microphones where the grill/shield on the mic is not making an electrical contact with the microphone housing and causes RF/ground noise (60Hz hum/buzz) to be introduced into your recordings.<br /><br />I received the microphone yesterday and was pulling my hair out for nearly a day now trying to eliminate the noise. I found that the -only- way I could eliminate the noise (without performing the steps below) was to remove ALL AC connections from the PC, Mixer, and even monitor speakers! This is obviously not optimal since my desktop doesn't run off of a battery!<br /><br />-- SOLUTION --<br /><br />I found a post by Googling from a gentleman that said he had the same problem with his mic. He said to resolve it, simply grab onto the grill of the microphone and while holding the base, give it a gentle twist (not particularly in any direction). I did this twice. on the second turn I noticed that the noise was ELIMINATED.<br /><br />I opted to request an exchange from Amazon as I was afraid that the connection would become loose again or I might cause damage to the mic by twisting the grill. When the second one arrives and is free of this defect, I'll just return the first one. (Amazon has the BEST customer service by the way, if your mic has this problem just give them a call!)<br /><br />Giving this 4 out of 5 stars only because I had to deal with this frustration. This defect has still not been corrected in new MXL 770's, so be prepared for some buzzing if you're unboxing a brand new mic. However, the &#34;twist&#34; trick might solve it for you!
