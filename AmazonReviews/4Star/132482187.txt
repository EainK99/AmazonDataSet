This is a good piece of equipment but not the greatest.  It does what is says it will do but is a bit fiddly.  I also use the JamIt pro on the iPad and to be honest I prefer the quality of the sounds and the ease of use of the JamIt.<br /><br />Having said that for the money this is a useful addition and allows access to the excellent Line 6 service.
