JamTech Lightbeats headphones are a great inexpensive quality choice for children and teenagers. They come in a variety of colors (I have red) and they light up to the beat of the music or whatever you are listening to. The good thing is you can turn the lights on or off. These can be used in smartphones, laptops, tablets and MP3 players/Ipods. They have good sound and are comfortable to wear. 4/5 stars!
