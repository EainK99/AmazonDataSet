I really don't anticipate the Novation Launchpad replacing real instrumens in live performances. I have seen a couple of live bands using them, and believe it or not, seemingly, with great success.<br />Why is it necessary to use the Novation Launchpad with an internet connected computer? I dedicate my recording studio to a computer that is not threatened by internet viruses and find it rather inconvenient to have to depend on Youtube videos to teach me every aspect of using my new Launchpad, it took forever to get the information from the included manual disk simply because it was a tiny part of the working space window and used a microscopic and out of focus font. After wasting weeks on figuring out how to enlarge the font to a readable size, I still haven't gotten my Ableton Live software back onto my computer as it was overwritten by the Ableton Intro software included in the Novation disk. If you've already loaded an Ableton software program. I suggest that you not upload the Ableton Intro software because of it's severely limited libraries of clips, scenes and samples. Use the program that you already have running as in my case, you might not be able to figure out how to restore Ableton Live, and support is far off and really non-existent I find .<br />The launchpad itself is really neat; very hi-tech and easy to use with excellent response (even though it doesn't have velocity sensory pads). It is very fun to create so simply, complex rhythms and tunes, I'd highly recommend it to the masses that want to create music without the musical background needed to play in a real band. It is a new and innovative and extremely pleasant sounding  musical instrument (or I might say, it can be). That being said, I've heard a couple of bands using the Novation Launchpad and was very compelled with the highly polished final product. In summation I find this product to be a great and affordable deal, although with a very frustrating learning curve.
