plugged in this guitar sounds really good for the price.  not plugged in, it's probably 2.5-3 stars (not so good). But then again, it is an entry level Martin, so my expectations were not set super high.  I lowered the action to get easier play, which i suggest doing.  nice size for a travel guitar.
