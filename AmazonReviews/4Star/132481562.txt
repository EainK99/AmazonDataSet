I've always wanted to learn drums, but I've always lived in apartments.  With the Alesis DM6 I can practice every day and not worry about bothering anyone.  It is not as dynamic as a real set, and the major setback is that the symbols - especially the hi-hat, are clunky.  But for the price and size, this is a great set for a beginning drummer that doesn't have the forgiveness of their own practice space.
