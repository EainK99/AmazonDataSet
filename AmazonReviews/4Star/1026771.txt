The Lumiens double light gives more than adequate coverage for a host of needs. I record audio and shoot video on location and this fits in my kit easily, provides enough light for all occasions and seems tough enough for some abuse as all locations have. The AC adaptor is nice to have for extended periods of operation. I like the redundancy of the light heads as I can position the two to cover more area if needed ( like dials on a mixer and lcd read out on the cameras). All in all, I highly recommend the Lumiens.....light your own path accordingly!
