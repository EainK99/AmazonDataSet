Fits a Makala Dolphin perfectly.  I have 8 instruments in black ballistic nylon gig bags.  I needed a change of pace and this is a nice color for a uke bag.  This gig bag seems to have a little padding which I really wasn't expecting.  That's great!  Nice rather spacious outer zipper pocket with single zipper that is more than big enough for a pack of spare strings but not a chord book.  The pocket is larger than on some guitar gig bags I have.  The main instrument compartment has 2 zippers that meet in the middle.  Cool color.  Good material feel and it appears to have good craftsmanship.  Bag is so good makes me want to try a Schmidt uke soon!<br /><br />Looks like it will hold up.  I'm one for updating reviews so I'll let you know how it holds up.  For the money this is a good bag.  It isn't good for air travel or a world tour or anything like that, but for just knocking around town with a cheap uke like a Dolphin it is ideal.  I'm happy!  This was a pretty good buy.
