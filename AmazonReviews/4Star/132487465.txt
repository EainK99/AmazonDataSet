I beat the hell out of drums on a daily basis and these hold up just as well as the next name-brand.  However, the feel of them is a bit rough and the sizing of the tips and girth of the sticks are inconsistent.  Get what you pay for, but if you're not picky like I am, and go through an average two sticks an hour, they'll do just fine until I get a stick endorsement.
