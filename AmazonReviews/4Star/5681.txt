Ok, here's the deal, if you really want to practice drums where you normally can't, like in an apartment or bedroom that would bother people, then here's the ticket, but they are extremely quiet, so when you accidentally hit the rims it way overpowers the sounds of these heads. They are spongy and don't totally feel like regular heads, but that's some of the trade. I have always had trouble tuning my drums to specific notes due to the resonant head and the beater head not having the same tension, of course this is me personally, I find that since you are only tuning the resonance head (bottom) and tensioning the mesh head you can tune these quite easily, after realizing how easy it is to adapt these heads into an electronic type setup with triggers I think I will lean more to that at this point for volume control, I was hoping these would be a bit louder.
