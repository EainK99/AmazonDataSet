These isolation pads work great if you are trying to seperate your stands/desk from your speakers. It'll help to reduce any vibrations that are caused by speaker-to-surface contact.<br /><br />These were a great purchase, as expensive as they were. They really shouldn't be this much for some foam pads, although the way they designed them to slope was -maybe- worth it.
