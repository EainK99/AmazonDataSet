Nice for the price. Cheap plastic case but very well designed and built on the inside, where it counts. Potential buyers should keep in mind that this is a &#34;line level&#34; device that is intended to be used with a professional sound board setup. If you want to use this with your typical home stereo or A/V unit it would be advised to place a pre-amp between the unit's line out and this device in order to &#34;drive&#34; it properly.
