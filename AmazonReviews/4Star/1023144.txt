Installed on my Ibanez artcore af75. It's a full hollowbody. I was able to use the strap screw along with the top two hinge plate screws so no drilling. I just left my bottom screws in the two bottom holes .I had a problem with alignment. It pulled to one side which seems to be a problem even with the real Bigsbys. The usual solution is to use a washer on the opposite side that it pulls to. Also, I bypassed the the tension bar and it plays fine on my guitar. No string jumping out of the bridge. However  the stock floating bridge kept creeping towards the neck every time I used the whammy. So my ingenious solution was to set the bridge and use wedges (pieces of Popsicle stick cut and painted)  placed between the bridge pickup and bridge. Along with rubbing graphite from a pencil on the nut  and bridge slots and on the underside of the string this worked like a charm. I didn't screw it down to the body. The strings hold it in place. Also, I noticed the sustain has increased.
