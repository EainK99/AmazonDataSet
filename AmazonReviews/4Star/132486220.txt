I wanted something to protect my guitar, but this may be a little overkill. I feel like I should be a traveling minstrel, although it will give me peace of mind when traveling by air. The lock is fairly simple to overcome and is not TSA compliant, but should protect it from coming open accidentally. The inside lining reminds me of cases from the 60's but it seems to be OK. Storage for pick and capos appear adequate.
