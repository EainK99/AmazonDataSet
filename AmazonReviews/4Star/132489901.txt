I was a bit skeptical about the product for the price. Putting everything together without an instruction manual was not a challenge after viewing the product online to see where parts went.<br />the stand has served it's purpose for me and has saved me from back pain after i finish my sets. the only draw back I can see is the metal is not very strong and can be bent with very little force. Occasionally I will have to bend the stand slightly so it does not rock from side to side. I still like this product, but I plan on upgrading to a sturdier stand in the future.
