This is a very good alternative to expensive  Sennheiser, Shure,and other popular headset microphones. I matches very well with a Sennheiser body pac transmitter. My only concern is that it may not stand up as well as the name brands. However at the low price ($80) you can afford it more often.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br />Al G.
