Quite nice for the price.  The best thing about it is it puts out deep colors but still bright enough for most uses.  I have 3 different versions and ordered them at the same time.  The differences were the menu structure, so it took some getting used to 3 different ways of controlling them.  I like the many different internal programs that can do just about anything you want them to do without a DMX controller, but with a controller they respond very well.  With the internal programs it can produce any color / brightness constantly or strobe, even flash at longer durations, or rotate through the entire color spectrum at a wide variety of speeds, any of that constant or flashing.  What I like most is the sound active mode where it changes to the music.  It responds well at a variety of volumes.  Even though I have a controller, I let these lights do it on their own because when you have several doing it independently, it makes for a nice overall scene for the music.<br />The only thing I don't like is the fan.  I doubt it really needs a cooling fan but it always runs and it's not loud but I'd rather not have it.  I may try unplugging one and see what happens.
