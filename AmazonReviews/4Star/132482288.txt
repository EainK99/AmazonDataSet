I bought this just to see if I might enjoy learning or if my shoulders (I'm gettin' old...lol)<br />would allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice.  I wouldn't say it's a<br />great instrument but WAY more than I expected for $60.  After I changed the strings,<br />(I used the extra set that came with it) it actually produced decent sound.  I bought a<br />new bow (for &#62;$100, so...) and found I like the one that came with it at least as much.<br />The case is excellent...I'll prob use it with my upgrade.<br />So for the price, you really get far more than you pay for.<br />p.s.- the shoulder rest is kinda useless though.
