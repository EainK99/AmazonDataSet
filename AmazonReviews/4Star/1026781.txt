I use this thing A LOT, and I recently noticed that I had almost worn through the rubber with the kick beater, which was a satisfying discovery but not that satisfying because this thing wasn't all that cheap. If you plan on using this product a lot, like every day, then be sure to apply a patch to it the same as you would with a regular bass drum head. Other than that it's really, really great!
