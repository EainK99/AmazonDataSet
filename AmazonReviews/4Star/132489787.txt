Converts tape machine output & some computer files to either mp3 or cd very easily once you figure out how to use it. Don't expect to install & use this product immediately.  With me, at least, it required a period of \\"trial & error.\\"  After a successful trial & error session it is easy to use & productive.  Just a list of commands & the function of the commands would be a significant help.  Even if I had known the problems of learning to use this product, I would have still bought it.
