I like the convenience of this little tuner.  I am a beginner guitar player and this has helped me a great deal to learn the notes and get them right!  I am finding, that with this tuner, my ear for notes is better all the time.  One day I would, of course, like to be able to tune my guitar (This one also does other instruments.) with only my ear, and do it correctly.  In the mean time, this is a very good buy.
