I didnt' want a $200 plus delay pedal. I just wanted something simple for a high end acoustic guitar with Baggs pickups that would add some nice warm analog delay, not be noisy, be simple to operate. I didn't need an input for a optional pedal to set tap tones.<br />This pedal delivers: It takes up only a little space. It's built like a tank. Mine is paired with a Fishman AFX reverb and doesn't add any noise, and the delay is nice.<br />The only negative is that to change the 9v battery requires unscrewing the entire bottom with a Phillips screwdriver and reassembling it. Thus the pedal is really designed to be used with a external power supply.
