[[VIDEOID:6a4429dc3b0d2bc7880eefda3b8cd545]] It's a dance party!  My children were so excited to see this light!  They have been having such a good time.  I like there is a charger for the light. My only issue with the charger is that it is not a mini-usb type charger.  If I lost the charge I'm not sure I could replace it.<br /><br />With the tripod, colorful swirling light, and the charger it is possible to have dance party (fun) anywhere!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in order to test the product and give my honest feedback.
