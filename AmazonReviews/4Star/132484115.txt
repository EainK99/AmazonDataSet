Love this tuner.  It's my backup tuner I leave on stage at my church for whoever is on acoustic.  excellent tuner.  It eats about 50 milliamps though so make sure you have plenty of 9-volts or keep it on a basic pedal power (Boss, One-Spot, radioshack).<br />I think it eats that much power because it is SUPER bright on stage and it is FAST.<br /><br />Does NOT have a bypass mode, so if you want it in your pedal chain, when it is on, you are muted.  Or can route it through your volume pedal &#34;tuner out&#34; mode though if you want it to stay on.  I use this mostly for on/off for acoustic.  I don't trust all sound guys to mute the channel when you're not on stage haha.<br /><br />It DOES have an &#34;in&#34; and &#34;thru&#34;  jack for those of you that need to daisy chain your power.  Not sure the output on these.  I know that Boss TU-2 tuners have a max of 200 milliamps of power on the &#34;thru&#34;.  If you use a One Spot or similar that outputs 1700 milliamps, best to use the daisy chain direct instead of powering it thru the tuner pedal.  You might get a short out if your pedals demand more than 200 milliamps of power.  I've seen 3 Boss tuners go bad at my church.  Haven't had a problem with the Snark tuner yet (fingers crossed).<br /><br />Excellent investment, doesn't take a huge footprint on your pedalboard, will eat more power than a normal Boss tuner, built like a brick.  I give it 4 stars beucase it is hard to get to the battery (vs Boss or ibanez).  Just be aware it'll take more time to change 9v batteries.  go with an adapter and you'll be fine.  I totally trust this pedal to be 440 in tune.  Great for the price.  go get it!
