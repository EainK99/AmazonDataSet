Great design; matches my black Takamine acoustic perfectly. Won't find better at that price point.  Pretty easy to install following images using 1/2&#34; drill bit for plug end and 3/16&#34; for bridge pickup. Only negative, no volume or tone controls but you can do without. What the seller doesn't tell you about usage is that this pickup combination is best used with a stereo plug to dual mono plugs (TRS).  The bridge pickup and sound hole pickup work independently. You can get some great tone this way by using a 2 channel amp or plug 2 channels into a mixer.  If you just use a standard mono guitar cord you won't get any signal coming from the sound hole pickup.
