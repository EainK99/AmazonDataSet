I purchased the Casio keyboard for a beginner student.  She loves the keyboard and is now taking piano lessons to learn more.  The package arrived on time but the headphones were missing from the package.  The stand and power supply was included but no headphones.  I called Amazon and they wanted me to return the entire keyboard and stand but I had already given the keyboard away as a gift.  So they credited me $20 with a promotional discount. I am disappointed that the bundle was incomplete but I am happy with the product.
