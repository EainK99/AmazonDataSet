I ordered this shofar for Yom Teruah 2013 and it arrived just in time which was earlier/just on time than estimated arrival date.<br /><br />The 15\\" is size is if you take a string and trace it around the edge. It isn't 15\\" if you lay it next to a ruler, which it would probably be ~8/9in.<br /><br />Also, there is definitely an odor with the horn if you place mouth piece close to nose, but the anti-odor spray does seem to help slightly.
