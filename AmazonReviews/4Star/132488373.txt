I'm still trying to get the hang of playing music to its time, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.  My only problem is what tempos it says it can use.  Probably about half of the songs I like playing have tempo numbers that aren't listed on the metronome.  (e.g., one song I like has a tempo of 46, and the metronome can't tick that speed.  44, yes; 48, yes; 46, no.)
