The sound on these speakers was everything the reviews said. It is just spectacular for this price range.<br />There is only one negative and it is the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  I was tempted to give 3  but the sound<br />is just superb.<br />The problem, as reported by others, is heat.  The powered speaker has the amp bolted to the backplate of the speaker..<br />and it gets hot. I would guess 50 to 60 C.  I took the box apart wondering if the insides were going to be a lot cooler<br />and the answer is no.  The reason heat is a big deal is because it shortens the lifetime of electronic components.<br />At this point I am keeping the speakers but also trying to add on more passive cooling fins to the backplate. It wouldn't<br />take much engineering,or cost, or time for M-Audio to fix this problem...They are really 5 star speakers (with a limp).
