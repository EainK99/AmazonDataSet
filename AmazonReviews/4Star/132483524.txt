I gave this four stars (instead of 3) because it is what it says it is.  A variety  of picks.<br /><br />I have been using the yellow tortex .73 picks for years. Prior to that I always used the torteloid medium (.73).<br /><br />This set contained three picks that would qualify (marginally) as 'Medium'. One was a trusted Tortex .73 Yellow, the rest were .70 or thinner, with the majority being some flavor of \\"thin\\" or \\"very thin\\" (.60 or thinner).  Nothing heavier than the .73 medium yellow tortex.<br /><br />The variety of pick 'types' was really good.  Tortex, Ultex, (textured) Nylon, and Pearloid.  I just wish the variety of thicknesses was a little better.
