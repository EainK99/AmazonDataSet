To start, the guitar is very light, and is completely hollow, which, in high volume situations, creates feedback. The guitar sounds wonderful. Very warm tones between the pickups, definitely a hollow body sounding guitar. It actually even sounds great unplugged! I do, however, need to comment that since I tuned it up, the bridge has been rattling, because of one of the intonation screws remains loose, even after tightening it, which, in turn, throws off the intonation, and makes the guitar sound out of tune. Tuners could be better, but that's an easy fix. The neck is much like a Les Paul neck, very fat, and thick. Not the fastest neck, but if you're accustomed to the feel of a Les Paul, you won't be disappointed. All in all, I'd rate this guitar a 4/5, only saying that because of the tuners and the bridge. Other than that, it is a great sounding guitar, very light on the shoulders, and another to add to the collection!
