Well I found this on another web site on sale, and when it arrived hooked it up with the little instructions that came with it. Could not get a sound through it with my Bass. I could see I was getting an input signal by the tuner part of it. So I was ready to send it back, but, E-mailed IK Multimedia and told them of the problem.<br /><br />They replied asking me to go to my iPhone and try a few things, that did not help. I asked them if they had a better manual. They e-mailed me back with a better instruction manual on the software.<br /><br />If You want this IRig interface to work right, you have to go the the menu and click on setting, and set the unit up like you would on the real equipment. They say do not turn off the \\"feedback\\" Well I found out I had to turned off the feedback to hear any sound. This was the only way I could hear my self playing my Bass. Yah! ???? Set Input/output levels to Zero before Putting the head set on like instructions. (I had no problems with turning feedback off)<br /><br />Set the input and output levels like you would do on a mixer. No more hissing problems. You have to treat the software on you phone iPhone just like you would, if it were the real hardware equipment. Hope this will help others that are having problems with the iRig. E-mail for that manual it helped me. Rated it 4 because they should have sent the software manual with it. It's a good little interface if you know how to set it up. Link: [...]
