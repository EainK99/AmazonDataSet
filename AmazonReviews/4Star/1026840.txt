Regardless of whether you are an orator or singer giving speeches or live performances this is a perfect stand for properly holding a good quality microphone. Although I received this more than three weeks back, I had to wait to write this review because I wanted to first get this item utilized and tested for various different scenarios like for the case of speeches, performances and so on and it has withstood many of these varied scenarios very well and is very resilient! My intention was to give it a 4.5 star rating but the ranking interface allows me to choose a 4 or 5 nothing midway, so I chose a 4, however you could take it as a 4.5 for realistic assessment. The only reason for not according it a full 5 star rating was because it is not directly usable in the case of performances where the singer or accompanist sits cross-legged (like in Indian classical performances). In these cases it would be optimal that you also have a side mount boom microphone stand. For that purpose, I had to purchase the &#34;On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom&#34; which can be adjusted perfectly in a 300 degrees angle for the microphone-hold arm and could be conveniently side-mounted on the PylePro stand at any position thus rendering it suitable for the Indian classical style performances.
