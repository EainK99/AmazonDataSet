The amp circuitry itself is awesome!  It works exactly as advertised, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small package.  Though I might like it better if it had some sort of mode selection so you could get more than one sound out of it, it's honestly a great little amp.<br /><br />The problem is with the construction.  There is no sort of strain relief whatsoever on the headphone jack, so after only a few days of use the jack's solder pads came off of the PCB.  I was only getting sound on the right channel and the sound quality was quite poor.  Opening the device up, resoldering the connection, and then adding some hot glue to hold everything together solved this problem nicely.  Not everyone has a soldering iron with them though, so I'd caution you to be careful when plugging/unplugging the headphones, be gentle, and if it breaks take it to someone with electronics experience - it's probably a 10 minute fix.<br /><br />Still, I'm quite satisfied, so 4 stars.
