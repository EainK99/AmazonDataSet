This capo is a must have by guitar enthusiasts. The sleek silver along with the amazing ability to hold down strings is really a great leap in technology! However i only gave this 4 stars because this idea of a capo was stolen from my ancestors in the days of old, forged in the fires of Mount Doom and will always be the GREATEST GIFT TO MANKIND! but this one is good for the price.
