I was worried when I bought this violin because many people were talking about the tuning pegs slipping and also how easy it was to break the strings. Others had talked about how the violin would not play. I have the solution to those problems and I have to thank YouTube for those solutions. Alright, lets talk about those slipping pegs. When you tune your violin, gently push in the peg while twisting. But, be careful when you twist. The brand of strings that come with the violin are easily prone to breaking. So what I suggest that you do is when you tune the violin, gently turn the tuning peg to where you are close to the proper tuning note and then use the fine tuners, the little knobs on the bottom of the strings, to finish the tuning for that string. Now the violin not playing problem. You need to put rosin on the bow in order for it to play. I sat for about 10 minutes rubbing the bow with rosin before I could get a continuous note to play down the full length of the bow. It plays great and sounds like how a violin should sound.
