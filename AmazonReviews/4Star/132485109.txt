I bought this to use with a GoPro3 (you need the overpriced GoPro mini USB to 3.5mm adapter). Even though the dynamic range is not quite covering the 20Hz to 20kHz range, the quality is good and I love the long cable that allows for example to record video in front of the car while recording the audio of the exhaust.<br /><br />Only problem is the short battery life and no way of knowing when the battery died.
