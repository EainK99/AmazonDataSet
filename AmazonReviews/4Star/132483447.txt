I was happy with the price, $40 cheaper than retail. The DD65 will certainly serve it's purpose, very versatile, of course not as responsive as the larger expensive digital kits. However the bass and high hot &#34;pedal-buttons&#34; are terrible. I've never seen such cheap foot controllers. It's an obvious ploy, you will be forced to upgrade to the expensive bass and high hat pefdals. Fortunately I already have them from my Roland full size digital drum kit. If you can't afford the upgrade there are much better small, inexpensive foot controllers out there.
