I've had other DigiTech pedals in the past, and this one doesn't disappoint. It's a simple pedal, but it has loads of preset effects, with 40 factory and 40 additional copies of those presets to edit or make your own. I purchased this mainly to use with headphones and aside from the fact that some of the presets sound very similar, and some are downright silly, but fun to play with, it's a nice solid pedal. I do wish that an AC adapter came with it, but it was only $50, and you probably have some spare adapters that could power this pedal lying around. I know I do. All in all, a solid, cheap pedal for playing around with.
