I added this to a desktop computer used for voiceovers on my son's Simon and Adrien cartoons that he is converting to video (simonandadrien.com - youtube.com/simonandadrien).<br /><br />It's got a surprisingly good sound for what it is and the price point. I would consider buying a larger version of the Behringer USB mixers for my professional studio (jerryboutotmusic.com).
