I bought it for my 4 years old daughter. Comfortable for her. Finish could be better. And I think it is reasonably sturdy because I saw one day she was standing on the guitar top and it did not break yet.<br /><br />The tone is nice. I think the strings are not very good. It took a week before it held the tuning well. But holds the tuning great now as they stretched over time. Planning to replace them soon with a good set of strings.
