I was all set to give a negative review to this thing,as the first one of these i received had a broken switch. I decided to order one more because of the glowing reviews on Amazon and other places around the net, and I am glad I did.  This pedal has everything I was looking for in a distortion pedal:  squealing feedback, endless sustain, vicious tone, and best of all, clarity.  The quality control may be a little suspect, but if you get a working one, this is a fantastic pedal for less than the cost of the Boss DS-1.<br /><br />Worth the hassle.
