If your style is heavy with strong attacks on the strings, then lighter gauge strings are not the best match.  When you hit them hard they will offer very little resistance and will pull and bend.  I like this product from ernie ball because they allow me to really attack the strings to emphasize some dynamics in the song.  At the same time they do allow for some bending.  I also wanted the wound G because the greater mass gives it more sustain.
