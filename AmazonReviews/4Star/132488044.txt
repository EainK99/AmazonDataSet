Great seller but some minor issues w/case upon receipt, namely a couple of latch tips that were bent inward causing the case to not close properly. Fixed those myself and case now closes perfectly, so no big deal. Only other criticisms are that the Gretsch logo could be better (skimping on paint these days, TKL?) and there could be another latch or two, as three seems okay but I'm accustomed to four or five latches on a pricey hardshell case.
