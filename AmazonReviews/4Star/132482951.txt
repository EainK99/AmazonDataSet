These are mostly comfortable, and average sounding headphones, and that's almost all about it. The overall build quality feels solid, and the including of the long cord, and the aux converter are nice additions. However if you are concerned about sound quality you'll find these TH-2000-R's not so satisfactory.<br /><br />They are mostly comfortable, depending on your head size. For medium to larger heads, they fit very well. However the ear pads are for small to medium ears, causing some mismatch. Yet, it did not cause discomfort, heat, or sweating with regular use, which is a very good property.<br /><br />Of course, the main reason for buying the headphones is for the sound. And they are not exactly perfect on this area. It is sufficient as a backup, as they are not entirely disturbing, yet the sound is neither fully clean, nor matches average music profile. It might be okay for watching videos.<br /><br />That's the dilemma for many average products. If you buy a cheaper (say $10) one, you know you're getting a very bad sound. If you're spending several hundred dollars, you (hopefully) will get a very decent pair. This one is for people who do not want entirely horrible sound, yet has a limited budget.
