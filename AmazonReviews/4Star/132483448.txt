I mostly purchased this instrument, because I have an Eddie Finn ukulele and wanted to branch out.  This classical guitar might not compare with a Gibson or Fender, but the low price makes it a bargain.  I can learn to play on this quite fine.  I don't have to mess with the tuning during a single session like I would with a similarly priced instrument.  Overall I am quite happy with it.
