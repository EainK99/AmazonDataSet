This is another version in the long line of Levy's guitar straps..  Because of its natural color, it will go with any guitar without clashing with any finish.  Made of thick 2.5-inch wide leather, it is strong and supports all guitars throughout their weight range.  The strap is actually two pieces, the main strap and also a narrow piece, allowing for adjusting its final length to suit the individual guitarist.  The narrow piece also has a second hole for further attachment options.  In comparing this with some of the other strap brands on the market with prices in la-la land, all-in-all Levy's has produced another good one.  My original review has been edited slightly since over time I have been able to compare this more &#34;natural&#34; strap with other Levy's straps which I own that are more pliable and refined.
