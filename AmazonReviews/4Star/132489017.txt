My wife wanted this for her keyboard.  It is a little larger than she thought it would be or even needs, but she likes it.  The extra space can hold more sheet  music and other things for a gig.  This was perfect for occasional use, but she said she would need a more sturdy version since the padding was not that thick.  It was a great price and arrived very quickly after purchasing.
