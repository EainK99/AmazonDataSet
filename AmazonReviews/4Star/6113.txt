This works very well in a teaching situation. I teach line dancing and need to be able to call out steps and instructions. The part (speaker) that attaches to a belt is a little larger than I like, but seems to work ok. The instructions for wearing the microphone etc., were not clear at all. If I hadn't already had one, I wouldn't have known how to do it. There just wasn't enough English instructions, which is why I didn't give a 5 star rating.
