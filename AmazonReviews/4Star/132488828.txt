My Hamer XT Flying V fits in this case perfectly, with almost no room to spare.<br /><br />Don't expect this to be the case of your dreams, but it gets the job done just fine.  It has a couple of pockets on front which are always handy.  Plus, there are two handles - one near the headstock on the back and one on the side - along with nice backpack straps. Delivery was very quick, and the price was right.<br /><br />One thing I don't like - the main zipper doesn't go all the way around on the bottom, which makes it a little awkward when putting the guitar into the bag kind of sideways.  Not a deal breaker by any means, but still a little inconvenient. Like the others have mentioned, I think the logo looks rather dorky, but that's an easy fix by removing it.<br /><br />To sum it up - this is probably the best bag you can buy at this price.  Measure your guitar and make sure it will fit before you order - the case is approximately 46 inches long and 18 inches wide.
