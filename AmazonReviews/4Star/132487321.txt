I ordered two pairs of these, one for my Fender P bass which has a thick leather strap, and one for my yamaha pacifica which had a thinner tweed strap with leather ends. The strap locks worked great with my Yamaha, very easy to install (comes with instructions) and fits perfectly into the old screws' holes and fit onto the strap.<br /><br />  However on my P bass, things were a little harder. The old screw holes worked fine, but the strap lock wouldn't fit over the thicker side of my strap until i ditched the washer, resulting in long term wear. Over all great design but I don't recommend using these on a thick leather strap.
