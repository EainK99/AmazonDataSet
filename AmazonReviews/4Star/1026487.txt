The drums work great and were a good escape for us and my son. You can't silence a regular drum set, but with these, you can practice quietly with a set of headphones. The only knock is that the frame tends to turn (shift) easily no matter how much you tighten the bolts. I wish there was a way to keep from turning up or down and changing the drum position. Other than that, they seem to work fine. I havent hooked them up to any quality speakers, but they sound fine hooked to one of those Harmon Kardon Iphone speakers.<br /><br />Setup took about 20-30 minutes and was easy to follow. Good kit to practice or play with.
