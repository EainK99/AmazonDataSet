I've been using EXL140 strings for years, and the EXP version when it came out.  All I can say is they are still excellent strings, but they seem to break sooner than before.  The older versions - copper coated bag - lasted longer.  I would say that on tour, playing sweaty clubs with high humidity, the EXL would get changed once a week without breaking and the EXP after 3 or more months during rehearsal!  The new version seems to be brighter, which I like, but I find myself changing the EXL after 4 shows and the EXP break during rehearsal under 12 days.  If they're identical strings, then maybe my TOM (tune-o-matic) Tone Pro bridge has an issue?  The strings that break are usually the basses.  I use a Carbon Edge 1.14 pick, but that wasn't an issue before.  I may try the GraphTech TOM saddles, but my Nik Huber fatback Orca never gave me any issues before.  Not sure what's up?  They are still better than any other Light Top Heavy Bottom strings out there.
