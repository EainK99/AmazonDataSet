I am new to guitars and bought this for my new Ibanez artcore. I wasn't sure what to expect. Got it mostly because it looked good in the picture. The seatbelt part is soft and flexible and is comfortable. The design is on a separate piece ands is stitched on. I didn't give it a 5 because a) I haven't used it that long and b) I've never owned a 5 to compare it to. I would buy it again though.
