I am singing publicly again after a couple of decades' hiatus, and I bought this so that I could learn music off of a score.  My performance instrument these days is the autoharp, and playing a melody from a score is a challenge.  Also, I haven't sung parts in ages, so I  need extra practice time.  This is just perfect for that purpose.  The action is s a little strange for someone used to a real keyboard--this one is completely flat, but I expect I'll get used to it with practice.  (That's what Miss Young used to tell me:  practice, practice, practice!)  Also, I was disappointed to find that I need to go out and buy the adapter that allows me to plug it into the wall.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sound and the range of its functionality.  Seems like a very good deal for the price and the purpose.
