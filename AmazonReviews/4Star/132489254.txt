These units have great sound and functionality, and are incredibly durable.  My only complaint is that the foam rubber pad glued to the bottom will eventually peel off or fall apart.  For my use, a smooth metal surface on the bottom is just fine, but for others who need the pad to keep the unit from slipping, be aware that you may have to reaffix some foam rubber after a year or two of use.
