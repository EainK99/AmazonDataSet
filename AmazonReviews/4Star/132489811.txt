Had a lot of fun mixing and interfacing with my HP Elitebook 8540w. Unfortunately, the headphone jack on this does NOT work with Virtual DJ (but the Serato software does enable it) Not sure if there is a setting I'm missing but that is the consensus...<br />Another minus is that the audio interfaces are RCA and not 1/4&#34; or XLR jacks. Who uses RCA anymore??! Had to get some RCA-&#62;1/4&#34; adapters to make this thing output sound to my PA system.
