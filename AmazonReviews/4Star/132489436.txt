I've wanted this guitar for a very long time. I found this to be a good deal to include the gig bag and stand plus strings. The extras were awesome to have. The guitar alone is a very good sounding guitar. I found the action a little higher than I like it but I'm planning to get it lowered. Other than that, the tuner on the guitar works great and the sound is nice and crisp. I also read a review here that said you can't play standing because there is only one hook but you can tie the other end of a strap to the neck of the guitar. To comment on the Christian fish symbol on the top; I actually like it and thought it was cute.
