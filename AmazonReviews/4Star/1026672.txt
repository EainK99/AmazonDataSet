This studio arm stand is pretty decent! It seems solid, and is tight. It holds up well and doesn't move around. In other words, it only moves when you move it. As you can probably tell, I am no expert, but I think this is a great deal for the price. It seems a little short for what I need it for, but like I said, for the price, it's very good! :)<br /><br />* I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.*
