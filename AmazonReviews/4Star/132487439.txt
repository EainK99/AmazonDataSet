These tuners were priced right and look nice on my double neck lap steel.<br /><br />The shafts did not line up with the center of the holes in the lap steel and the holes were half inch so I had to make up two hardwood bushings for each tuner, the holes in the four outside bushings had to be drilled off center.<br /><br />It took some time to make and drill out 24 bushings but now the tuners fit perfectly and look nice.<br /><br />This was no fault of the tuners it was because I did not know enough about tuners to order the proper size.<br /><br />I would recommend these tuners to friends and relatives if they had need for tuner replacement.<br /><br />George Shute.
