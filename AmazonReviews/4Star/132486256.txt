I purchased one of these alongside an American DJ Micro  Royal Galaxian Blue and Red.<br /><br />It's working great. The Green is the most visible but red is definitely there too. I can't use a hazer because of the fire system, but the lasers look great and the kids love it.<br /><br />I'm using it to light up the ceiling of the whole Youth Center.<br /><br />WAY better than the ADJ laser.<br /><br />It could use a better receiver for the remote control, but otherwise I love it.<br />(I just bought 3 more)
