Had this since summer 2015. This is a great mixer and durable, and it is very nice looking. Only thing I don't like is that it only has a high and low frequency adjustment knob, so you will need an equalizer if you want much Bass. Although I rigged it to use the guitar ¼&#34; ports and was able to get the additional 2 midrange controls.Other than that I am quite happy with my purchase.
