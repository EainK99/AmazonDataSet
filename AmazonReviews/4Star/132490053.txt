Why on earth would a drummer DESIRE to carry heavy weight stands if the lightweight stands like these do the job just fine? These stands are just great. They are light but also double braced so they'll hold your 26\\" rock ride and won't budge. The counter weight is useless but whatever. My only suggestion to the manufacturer is the boom needs to telescope into the shaft for travel. You have to completely disassemble the boom to put it in a gig bag... ?!? poor design there but once it' on stage it's great!
