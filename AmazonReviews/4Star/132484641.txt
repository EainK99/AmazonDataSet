If you lean towards rock, or blues styles you’ll enjoy these strings. For me, I’ve tried hundreds of sets of strings over the past 50 years I’ve been playing and I started using these about 6 months ago and I think I finally found a consistent “go to” set of strings.<br /><br />The high E, B and G, strings, (09, 11 and 16 gauge), give you the lead playability and feel of a set of &#34;Super Slinky's' with the ability to still pull off full sounding chords with the bottom end E, A and D strings weighing in at 26, 36 and 46 gauge. Also, the lower gauges are still light enough to keep the beginning guitarist from screaming in pain like they do with a set of heavy gauge strings, at least until they get their “finger pads” raised, yet offer a good warm sound, or crunch you look for in a heavier gauge.<br /><br />The only downsides for me is, I use these on an older 80’s Ibanez “Roadstar II” with the original floating trem and normally I used to put on a slightly heavier gauge set of strings, (10 - 46) and I had to tweak the intonation on the higher strings which should be done anytime you change a string gauge, but it is just such a pain in the a$$ with that floating trem! Also, I noticed “some” sets seemed to die faster than other sets did.<br /><br />All I can say is “Try ‘em and I think you’ll like them!”<br />And to make it even sweeter, “Pitbull Audio” offers some sweet deals and they ship immediately! I received mine 2 days earlier than the expected receive date and in perfect condition. Thanks Pitbull!<br /><br />Johnny<br />“No matter how frustrated you get, or how much you just don’t want to practice, or go to a lesson, or… You’ll get through it, so roll with it and NEVER QUIT and NEVER GIVE UP, because you were chosen and given this gift that will always be with you, no matter what life brings your way.
