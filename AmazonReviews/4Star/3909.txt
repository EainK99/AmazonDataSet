For everyone that has either bought or is looking to purchase Pro Tools... Pro Tools was designed for Mac's not PC's. They do offer the software for PC but it's night and day difference on quality. So.... You will need to get a Mac, even a really really cheap one, that all you use it for is recording. You can use basically any Mac. I always recommend at least getting an Intel based Mac instead of a power PC (AKA PPC) you can purchase a used (Intel) Mac desktop for only 150-$500 or if you're on a really tight budget you can even get away with just spending $50-$100 on an older Mac G4 PPC (Desktop) I do recommend spending the extra $100 or so and get the Intel based one, but any Mac will work and would be soooo much better. So... If you're using Pro tools, graphic design or really any audio video recording I would totally recommend using a Mac. Also, if you do decided to go this route I recommend just using the Mac for &#34;Recording Only!&#34; Don't play games, go online or really use it for anything else, especially don't go downloading a bunch of stuff on there, cause the Music will take up a lot of you Memory, so much I always recommend getting an external Hard Drive anyways, to keep your master copy's of all your music on. So, when you're done with a songs you can transfer it to your external hard drive and this way all your memory isn't used up on your Mac and also that way if anything happens to your computer or whatever the case is you will always have your Master safe on your external hard drive. I hope this helps! So please don't keep trying to use protools on a PC anymore. You are basically driving around with the sweetest Rims on a beater car that barely runs. That's the best way to describe using ProTools on a PC.haha
