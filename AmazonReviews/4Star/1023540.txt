My 12 year old Yamaha powered amp (EMX 660) and mixer has been serving me well for 12 years, though in limited usage (I am a DJ and sound guy for a professional theater group that does 2 - 10 gigs a year). The problem has been that I use an increasing number of microphones and other wireless devices (body packs) for driving remote speakers. I was looking at a high quality mixer with 8 microphone inputs, but it was nearly $300. Since I am still using CD players and I stack them on top of the amp, a mixer was not going to fit the limited space we often work in. Bottom line is I now have a new amp and mixer with almost the exact same case dimensions as my Yahmaha (very solid) 4 more inputs and a powerful amp just in case my powered speakers ever die. I tested it with all inputs in use at the same time for about 8 hours and though I will update this review if the thing dies on me, it seems quite solid and a perfect front line mixer (my still working Yamaha moves to a back up role). Now if I could only just turn the power amp off....  Updated review. Finally did a heavy duty live application, a 4 hour rehearsal with 4 wireless mikes, one wired mike and two sound sources. I was also driving a remote wireless speaker through the monitor channel. Channel 7/8 acted up on me and is now marked as unreliable. Channels 8/9 and 9/10 seem to produce different levels of sound with the exact same settings. The amp seems to work well otherwise, so far. But I am downgrading my review 2 stars. Total hours of service so far, less than 20. I have a 10 hour gig on Saturday, so I will update IF something else goes wrong.  Bottom line.  This ain't no Yamaha.  Updates review. Live test, an 8 hour rehearsal and live show with 5 mikes and 15 performers on two decks of a cruise ship. No problems. Especially useful are the tiny signal lights that blink when a mike is being used. This allows you to adjust gain on the mike being used remotely without having to guess. Upgrading review 1 star.
