Pretty expensive for a stupid sinusoidal wave slowly descending in pitch over 15 minutes! I scratched the last couple that came with my SL1 setup, so I'm picking these up. In retrospect, what I should have done was just torrented the audio file and burned my own...oh well, hindsight 20/20.<br /><br />If you buy a Serato setup, make sure you burn these disc images so that you can mount and burn infinite amounts for $0.05 a pop in the future.
