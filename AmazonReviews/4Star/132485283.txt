The picks are nice and I can see why people consider them classic. The logo actually slightly helps the grip texture and I really haven't been able to find better overall picks, but I know they're out there. 12 picks for $8 with prime is kinda pricey compared to most picks, but not too bad. Also checkout Planetwaves glow in the dark picks 25 pack for the same price if your into the feel of these picks.
