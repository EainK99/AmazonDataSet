I am waiting on my 2 18\\" Enforcers II.  I hope they put out the 2,400 RMS that I expect.  I have two of the 18\\" anti shocks but not enough thump for me.  But they are decent.... I LOVE Seismic customer service Brad and Jim always immediately address my concerns when I call them with an issue with a product.
