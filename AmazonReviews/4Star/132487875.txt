my first impressions of this microphone was the sound quality is amazing the only bad part about it is.that cord gets tangled very easily its like a 20 foot cord.but if you're looking for a high quality audio and for the price range you cannot beat this I use it on my Canon camcorder and it sounds amazing so this microphone is good for youtube .the only reason why I cannot give it 5 stars is that 20 foot cord gets very tangled and Messi.so guys just because it's cheap doesn't mean it's not great so go buy it and you'll have Krispy clean audio
