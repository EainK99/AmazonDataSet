Not bad for the price. I used this for a few weddings for the wedding party to make speeches, etc...  No drop-outs, but I was only transmitting about 50 feet, I don't know how it would respond in a 100 to 150 ft application. Average sensitivity, so don't let the person talking get it too far from their face. The microphones I really like are about 400 dollars, and I am not going to invest in those high priced mics anymore for the mobile gigs because of people dropping them, tossing them around, etc... This is O.K. for the low cost application. DJ Don.
