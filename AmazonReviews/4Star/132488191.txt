To be absolutely clear this is actually an 18\\" full range. It is  an 18 and it does get very clear bass which is improved by the fact that it doesn't need a midbass to cover what a normal sub would miss. If you want to rattle windows with low frequency distortion it would not be the best choice. However, if you want to hear the lower notes if a piano or other instrument it is fabulous. I DJ with four of these and push 750 very CLEAN watts into each of them without any problems. (see carvin.com for amps) As another review mentioned if you don't have a low pass filter, they will bottom out. I run them with 3.8 cubic feet of box per speaker, about half of what would normally go with an 18\\". The small box works well for the mobile DJ. They also look awesome and in my business appearance counts.  I plan on adding another four in the near future. Straight out, yes there are better speakers out there, just not at this price. I got a pyle 21\\" to see what it was like and \\"Oh, My God.\\" But, I can buy three of these for the cost of one of those. If you buy this for what it is and aren't trying to get the very bottom but prefer musical clarity you will probably like it. If you just want to rattle things pyle makes a more suitable product for a similar price. If money isn't stopping you, buy the Cerwin Vega TS-42 and bridge a 2000 watt Carvin amp to it.
