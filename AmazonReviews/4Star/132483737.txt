This is our son's second year of playing the sax.  We wanted to purchase him his own instrument this year.  After quite a bit of research we decided on this one.  We have not been disappointed.  Last year we rented a high end sax, and we cannot see many differences so far.  We did have to buy a new neck strap because the one it came with was pretty useless and painfull, but that was an easy problem to fix.
