It is a good buy for the money and something that I will be able to use to record to cd with.  The only thing missing is an 8-Track player which would be very handy to me since I have a small collection (50) 8-Tracks to transfer to disc.  I do have an 8-Track player, but when I tried to connect it to the Teac recorder, I could figure how to wire it into the aux receptors.  I am now looking for another 8-Track player to try to connect to.  Till then my collection will stay where it is.<br /><br />The Teac recorder is fairly simple to use, except you have to sit beside it and pause the cd to cause the recorder to give the next song on records and cassettes a new number or the entire side will be recorded as one song and you cannot jump forward or backwards to find a certain song.
