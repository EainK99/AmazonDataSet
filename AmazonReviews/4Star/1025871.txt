First off, these strings and the dealer I got them from are great,<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Soft strings, although they are a bit harder to hold down due to their larger gauge, they are soft on your fingers.<br />-Beefy sound yet still clear (not insanely muddy)<br />-Superb packaging<br />-If you order these puppies from the Musicians Discount Warehouse you get three free picks (Free stuff is always the best)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The put out a very tinny sound on single coil pickups in my experience (Not noticeable if you use any distortion on the amp)<br />-BEWARE if you have a floating bridge (Usually Strats that use Whammies) as they can lift the bridge up substantially if you don't have enough tension springs<br /><br />I give these Beefy strings 4 stars. Rock On :)
