I bought a Sennheiser 100 listening system about 20  years ago.  Since I have a hearing problem, I can listen to the television without distracting anyone else around me.  The sound is very crisp.  After all these years, the device started to get old and needed replacement.  I was delighted when I saw this replacement set on Amazon and bought it.
