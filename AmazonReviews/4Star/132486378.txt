This Shock Mount is good build quality and it holds all my mics that I need. Its strong enough to hold larger mics inverted but I wouldnt invert any of my smaller mics with it. The pop filter that comes with the mount is awful. Just purchase one to screw into it yourself or make a another stand. So overall this is a solid shock mount that fits most standard mics however order a shock mount separate because it doesn't work at all.
