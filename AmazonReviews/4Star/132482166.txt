Filters a ton of noise, but very difficult to attach to things other than a mic stand.  I got this with a Blue Yeti, and it's hard to find any stands that support the Yeti's weight.  So, I used my camera tripod as an ad hoc stand, and it is literally the only thing this filter will clamp to properly.
