I found these headphones give a wide open concert hall sound. The treble and bass at high and low ends respectively was very crisp.<br /><br />The sound presented is at a lower volume than other headphones on the same setting, which has thrown me a bit, & outside noise can be a bit invasive, but all together a well rounded headphone at a great value.
