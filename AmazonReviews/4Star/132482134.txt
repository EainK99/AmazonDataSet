I got my first Rovner Platinum ligature in a trade deal, and liked it so much that I bought my first Platinum P-2R for rubber tenor mouthpieces about six months ago.  Then I bought my second Platinum P-2R (the one I am reviewing here) a few weeks ago.  I liked several things about my first two Platinums: 1) how quick and easy they were to use, even in low light, 2) how securely the ligature held any reed in place, and 3) how flexibly they adapted to slight changes in barrel diameter.<br /><br />Then I ordered this one - my third Rovner Platinum and second P-2R. I noticed that the \\"girdle\\" (the part that goes around the barrel) is slightly out of round and that reeds tend to torque towards one side of the table.  This really annoys me because the time I save using a single screw lig is frittered away tweaking the reed.  I haven't tried to bend or fiddle with the girdle (yet), but for this kind of money I think  a customer should not have to.  I also noticed a cosmetic change - that the two bars to which the lig screw are attached are no longer brass but apparently nickel.  The cosmetic change is hardly a deal breaker, but it occurs at the same time as the girdle is out of round and reeds are pushed to one side of the table.<br /><br />Is this a coincidence - the luck of the draw so to speak - or has Rovner cut quality and cost at the same time?  I don't know.  I gave the Platinum P-2R a generous four stars because I hate to slam a product based on one out of three experiences.  But I personally will think twice before buying another Rovner Platinum.  If I do buy one, it probably won't be online but somewhere where I can open the box and look at it.  The Platinum is a pricey lig and there simply are other tried and true choices at this price point, like the Francois Louis Ultimate for example.
