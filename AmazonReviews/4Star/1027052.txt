Loved this product. Great harmonica, great sound. I am only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because when I opened the package the harp had shifted during shipment and came lose in the cheap little case. This caused some major scratches on the cover plates, but it still sounds great! If you are getting this item strictly for collector purposes, I suggest not buying it online.
