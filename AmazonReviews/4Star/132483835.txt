This is a great store to deal with.  Chieftain is a great whistle.  But if you get this High D it will be a little cannon.  It takes a lot of air on the second octave G and higher and it does have a lot of chiff.  I was told this is typical for this whistle.<br /><br />I am currently thinking of getting another whistle, maybe the Burke.  I might keep this high D, I might sell it, I'm not attached to it.  I did buy the chieftain A and I love it.  I think chieftain whistles are more popular in the lower keys.  This high D would be great for outside performance or for blowing your mother in laws ear drums out.  It is very responsive though, and it has good tone, which I do favor for some music.
