l've had it about 5 months. It works great,very easy to use. When an album gets to a quieter part, the software thinks it is a separate song. It would have to be separarted and done manuely. On live albums withcrowd noise it can't tell between the tracks. I could put it to manuel and babysit each track if it really mattered. After My son got it going, it works great and very much worth the price!
