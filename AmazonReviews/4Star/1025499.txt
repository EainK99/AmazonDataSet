Very good quality viola for a student--it has a nice sound and feel, but the bow is poorly made.  I had to purchase another bow; the hair bow was not consistently attached to the plastic/composite/synthetic material (I cannot believe the bow was made of Brazilian wood as the decription stated, and the bow hair did not feel like real horsehair to me).  The frog was wobbly black plastic that was poorly attached to the stick. I did not give this three stars because of the bonuses this set came with--the backpack-style hard case, the extra bridge and strings, and the chromatic string tuner with metronome.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase but highly recommend that budding violists replace the set's bow with a higher-quality one ($30+).
