The banjo is really pretty great for the price.  I would suggest that you buy a bag if just starting out due to the nature of having an instrument just laying around.  The only downside is you may need to reset the bridge in the proper location, mine was ok but with some fine tuning it would be better.  I would definitely buy it, knowing what I do now.
