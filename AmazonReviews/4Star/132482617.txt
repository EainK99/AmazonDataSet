This guitar had been bought through me by a friend of mine.  The wood finish in the picture is not the exact same color as show, however that wasn't a big issue.  When received, the guitar's first volume knob did not work. Ended up having to open the back to resolider both the pickup positive and negative wires back to the knob's pot.  Other than that, the bass sounds great, and looks great.  Intonation was on the dot, only other thing that was slightly wrong was the E tuner was tilted a bit to much and made it hit the B tuner on initial tune up, but otherwise was great after a few touch-ups.<br /><br />Good Buy, yet cheap enough to deal with for a long run.
