The shipping does take a while. It took about almost 4 weeks, but it was worth it. The case itself is really nice. I was afraid my acoustic wouldn't fit because the body is pretty big but it fits nicely. There's 3 pockets with plenty of room. I was able to fit my capo, tuner, and a lot of other papers and things. I still have an extra pocket. The only problem I had with my case is the zippers. They are not the best for the pockets. One was obviously broken and the other was sewed wrong. The case is padded but I'd advise you to be careful because it is light weight so you could damage your instrument. The design is beautiful and overall I can say it was worth it.<br /><br />So I've been having the case for 4 months now and I can honestly say don't waste your money if you're a heavy guitar user. The zipper to close the guitar is already broken and seams are coming off. The case is basically falling apart. As soon as I have the money I'm going to get a more durable, reliable case. I use my guitar everyday and take it to school and all and the case looks like I've had it for years.
