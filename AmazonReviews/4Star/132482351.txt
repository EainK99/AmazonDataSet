I bought this for my granddaughter's 10th birthday.  She loved the pink guitar.  Had all the accessories.  The guitar arrived promptly and was in excellent condition.  Only problem was I didn't know how to tune it, but she has a big brother who will help with that.  Would purchase from this seller again.
