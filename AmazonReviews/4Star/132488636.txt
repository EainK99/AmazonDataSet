This stand fit my Yamaha NP31 perfectly. It does not seem to wobble and is sturdy. It was easy to assemble; however, it was a little difficult to get it properly aligned by myself. I'm waiting on a bench, so in the mean time, it's a little high for me and you cannot adjust it; however, it definitely gets the job done!
