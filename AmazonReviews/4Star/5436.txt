This shaker is great if you need to free the hands for other other things like strumming a guitar or playing a cajon...I was worried that it would be top-heavy and move around on your finger but so far it's working as expected. It's not as loud as you would think, being that this is the &#34;loud&#34; version of Meinl's MS shaker, and should be great for both studio and live performances. Well made and inexpensive, I rank this shaker above similarly priced LP shakers, all of which have failed me during performances.
