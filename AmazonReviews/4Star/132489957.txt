ChromaCast's electric guitar bag is relatively inexpensive, fairly well built, and features a number of zippered compartments, of varying shapes and configurations, to store accessories, like cords, picks, and a tuner.  The case is very convenient to carry, as it has a handle on the top, and a second handle on the side.  It also has a set of shoulder straps, for carrying the guitar on your back.  The quality of the nylon is decent enough, and there is a rubber pad on the bottom for protection and traction.<br /><br />The amount of padding inside the bag is a little light, and the zippers might not be heavy duty, but for general use, this bag is hard to beat for value.  Economically priced, and with ample storage space, it's easy to understand why this item is a top seller at Amazon.<br /><br />Approximately 42\\" long, this symmetrically shaped bag, is best suited to certain guitar bodies.  It can accommodate common styles like the Les Paul and Stratocaster, but if you have an exotic shaped guitar, or a fancy headstock, there could be an issue fitting the guitar inside, or with zipping the case closed.  It's a little hard to say with certainty, but this case may be able to accommodate a guitar up to around 2.25 inches deep.  If you have a thick semi-hollow body guitar, acoustic guitar, or classical guitar, you might want to look at [[ASIN:B009ZX91AI Chromacast's acoustic guitar case]], which is very similar in design, except deeper.
