The price is really nice. It's got everything you need. BUT it is VHF. It takes a little tweaking to find the &#34;sweet spots&#34; for the antennae to receive well. Everything, including smart phones, mess with the VHF signal. I keep my transmitter on my guitar strap, facing the antennae. That almost completely eliminates problems.
