These are much larger than one might expect if the specifications are not observed.  They look exactly like their smaller siblings in the 5&#34; and 6&#34; formats, and if anyone happens to see a photo with these other version, it may be misleading.  The KRK RP8G3-NA will not typically fit nicely on a standard-sized desk.  I have mine sitting on speaker stands.<br /><br />I had some issues with noise until I switched to a balanced XLR cable connection.  These speakers were the only device that had noise with my my USB and RCA connections that experience dead silence with many other DAC and amp combinations I am currently using with headphones.  Keep this in mind if you plan on plugging these directly into a computer sound card or typical DAC with unbalanced outputs.<br /><br />They sound wonderful and achieve very loud volume levels when using a standard line level source.  Being studio monitors with a relatively flat frequency response, if you are not used to the type of sound signature, it may seem a bit shocking as small details are revealed that might not have been heard before, and sometimes these details are not musical in nature and can detract from the overall experience.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Welcome to the audiophile world. :-)<br /><br />I listen to these for playback only.  My studio experience is very minimal.  While these speakers are marketed and sold for studio work, and there may be other speakers that are more suited to accuracy with regards to the creation and analysis of music, few speakers will outshine the KRK's for pure satisfaction and enjoyment.  These are still studio monitors with a very flat frequency response.  The 8&#34; version digs deep enough into the lower frequency range to provide adequate bass extension, and the moderate emphasis on the bass and treble serve to make listening to regular music a lot of fun.<br /><br />There is not much better to be had at this price.  Slightly different perhaps, but not necessarily an improvement, only a preference to some.  I highly recommend these to anyone.
