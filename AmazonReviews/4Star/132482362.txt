Got this yesterday.  It is a rigid box, covered with thin, velcro-friendly, padding on the inside and durable ballistic nylon on the outside. If you want to subdivide the interior, you can do it with camera bag dividers that have male velcro strips.<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed in the wheels. They say there are \\"four\\" wheels, but actually, there are two fat wheels with a molded groove in the middle that makes it look like each wheel is two wheels, but isn't. The wheels are some kind of plastic, not urethane, and don't roll freely like high quality urethane wheels do. My [[ASIN:B001RQ0GCS Gator Speaker Bag Fits SRM450 with Wheels and Molded Bottom (GPA-777)]] rolls like a dream because it has better wheels.<br /><br />The zipper is a bit smallish and doesn't take the corners easily, but is functional. Looking at the bag as illustrated, it zips along the left, top and right of the bag, allowing the whole side (or front -- the part with the outside pocket) to flop down like a loading ramp.<br /><br />The box itself is very sturdy and strong enough to be considered \\"crush proof.\\" It will protect well the many small pieces of audio gear (mics, small field mixer, cables, accessories) I intend to carry in it.<br /><br />The handle is durable and long enough so the box trails behind nicely without flutter. Lifting handles are strong and durable.<br /><br />I'm using this because the Pelican I was using didn't have wheels and was simply too heavy when loaded. Speaking of heavy, this rolling box is not exactly lightweight. Because there is 1/4\\" plywood in the walls to strengthen it instead of being a soft foam-walled case, it's a little on the heavy side. But it's the price you pay for protection.<br /><br />Pictures later after I get it set up with dividers, etc.<br /><br />Official dimensions from SKB:<br /><br />Interior Length<br />19.25 in<br />48.90 cm<br /><br />Interior Width<br />12.75 in<br />32.39 cm<br /><br />Interior Depth<br />11.00 in<br />27.94 cm<br /><br />Exterior Length<br />22.50 in<br />57.15 cm<br /><br />Exterior Width<br />14.38 in<br />36.51 cm<br /><br />Exterior Depth<br />14.00 in<br />35.56 cm<br /><br />Carton Length<br />25.50 in<br />64.77 cm<br /><br />Carton Width<br />15.75 in<br />40.01 cm<br /><br />Carton Depth<br />15.38 in<br />39.05 cmbr />Exterior Length<br />22.50 in<br />57.15 cm<br /><br />Exterior Width<br />14.38 in<br />36.51 cm<br /><br />Exterior Depth<br />14.00 in<br />35.56 cm<br /><br />Carton Length<br />25.50 in<br />64.77 cm<br /><br />Carton Width<br />15.75 in<br />40.01 cm<br /><br />Carton Depth<br />15.38 in<br />39.05 cm
