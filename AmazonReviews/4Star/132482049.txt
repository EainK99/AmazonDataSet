As other reviewers mentioned, this Shaft Lock is very tight when you first try to slide it through the silver pole.  Once it is in place, heavy books on the stand will not make the \\"desk\\" sag.  It is made of plastic.  I was afraid to crack the plastic by over tightening the screw/nut that secures this to the black lower pole.  If it is not tight here, it will slide up if you pull up the stand.  Useful if you are not moving the \\"desk\\" up and down as often.  It will defeat the main feature of the Manhasset music stands: you do not need to loosen/tighten a knob to change the height.  You Let's see how long this will last.
