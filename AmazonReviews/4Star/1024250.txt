I loved the guitar and the chord buddy was easy to install, however, I am having problems with a couple of the chords. I called the chord buddy help line and they were very helpful and sent me out some of the rubber ends to try out and also put in some picks. I am hoping that will help. I am at least playing a few of the tunes with the C and D chords.  I have always wanted to play the guitar. I have even tried without the chord buddy but it is so hard on the fingers. Love this.
