The headphones included in this bundle (Colby CV320) have a standard 3.5mm jack and are designed for use with MP3 players. Unfortunately they did not work with the Casio Privia PX-150 which has two 1/4\\" ports.<br /><br />I'm searching for an adapter or will just have to buy a different set.<br /><br />Otherwise the keyboard and bench are exactly as advertised and our children love it.
