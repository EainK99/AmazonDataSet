I only purchased it because I needed a standalone mic for Counter Strike Source. I was tired of buying cheap headsets or supposed quality gaming headsets and dealing with their terrible sound and lack of quality engineering. Now I can use a good quality pair of headphones and upgrade them anytime I like without worrying if a mic is married to it. I immediately had several comments about how clear my voice transmission was after setting it up. I also purchased a NEEWER Microphone Suspension Boom Scissor Arm Stand to hold it. I must admit this is my favorite mic setup I have ever owned and I have had a few including the AT2020. I only wish the CAD U37 USB was not made out of pure plastic because the mic quality is good.
