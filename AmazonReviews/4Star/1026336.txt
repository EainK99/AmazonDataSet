[[VIDEOID:11c1f4c5db23815c9212567506f84a97]] This was a sample sent to us direct from the manufacturer. Shipping took about 10 days. This is a 18 x 1 watt led Par light. It is made of durable plastic similar to what the &#34;name brand&#34; light are now using. It is fan cooled. The fan does make some noise, but when placed on a light truss you don't even notice it. Once the music is playing you would never hear it anyways. The light is very bright. The new leds that are being used these days are very bright and have good color. The light has an led display and is easy to setup. It does have dmx in & out. It works well with a light controller. You will need to use a light controller that has at least 7 channels on it to work correctly. The sound mode works well. You can set it to a specific color or let it jump colors or fade/blend to different colors. The strobe function works well and you can control the strobe speed. This is a very good light for the price. Carl in customer service is great to work with.
