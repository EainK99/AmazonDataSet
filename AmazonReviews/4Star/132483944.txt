I didn't get this unit at Amazon but rather a well-known online music vendor who I prefer to do business with (sorry Amazon.) I was hesitant to get a looper because I consider them gimmicky, sort of cheezy and usually not done in any interesting way. But I gave it a shot because I'm a solo (electric) guitarist and singer who has incorporated drum machines and now a looper into his act to go along with my vast array of effects and amp simulators. Oh and I play a Fender Jaguar so my tonal options are, let's just say, wide open... I can pretty much get any sound under the sun. It's great. Anyway, onto the looper... simply put, I love it. I'm thinking of upgrading to the 300 I like the 30 so much. It's a powerful tool for the solo performer and I'll never not use one again. Once YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING (hint hint to many of the reviewers on this site of this product) it's a snap to use and I use it live all the time and record in a \\"live\\" manner with it \\"all the time\\" It is super easy to play a piece of music, click the left pedal quickly TWICE and the loop starts immediately. Works like a charm. Two separate looping channels, some \\"interesting\\" effects, ease of use, tons of storage time... what's not to like? Built like a tank. Love it. Don't listen to the ADD generation who didn't have the patience to read the freaking manual.
