About three times the size of a standard floodlight.. More of a spotlight than a broad spectrum IR light. If you are looking to improve IR light 100+ feet away, this is perfect. Way too powerful and will give you a washed out look if you are going for short distance. Only problem I really have is how you mount it. Wire comes outside of the mount so you will need to cut and run inside if you want a clean install. No left right movement. Would be nice if they offered a manual ptz bracket to mount on. Overall, very nice and will be purchasing more when I increase my camera count.
