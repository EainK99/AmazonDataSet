Bought this for the 2013 New Mexico Black Mass Blowout. My band was playing the second stage and I needed a trampy edge to my look. This Warlock not only made me appear even more godlike than I already do when I shred through yet another magical and wizard-inspired solo, its shape's cutout displayed my massive spiky codpiece. (My other amazing piece of equipment!) The maidens in the first four rows swooned when I smashed this Warlock to smithereens and Satan came out of it sweating. I knocked off one star due to the fact that it killed my kitten when she touched it. \m/
