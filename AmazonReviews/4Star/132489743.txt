The color of the guitar is not like what is pictured.  I ended up paying a little more for this one because my son wanted the blue color.  The guitar looks more black than blue.  It certain like you can see a blue tint.  I was expecting the blue in the picture.  It is still a very nice guitar.  The amp is perfect size for what he needs and seems to work really well.  If it wasn't for the color difference I would be able to rate it with 5 stars.  It arrived on time and it great condition.
