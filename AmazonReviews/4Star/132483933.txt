These picks come in a pack of five they were worth the money but i thought the picks were made out of a stronger material that lasts longer but its more of the flexible lighter plastic which leads to my only complaint the picks wear out fairly quick i noticed after a couple days of jammin that the pick had lost a lot of material other than that if u play guitar and love cannibas then the quality won't stop u from gettin a cool lookin pick
