As a contractor, I'm always looking for good products that are similar too, but less expensive, than my competitors.  This certainly is less expensive than most other ribbon or tape lights I've installed.  However, couple of things a purchaser should be aware of.  First off, the color spectrum though labeled cool white is more cool than white.  Verging towards the blue end of the spectrum to my eyes.  However, the customer had no issue with the color and likened it more of a daylight spectrum.  I think they're nuts.  If you're not looking at the color of lamps all day, then it probably won't bug you. In a room with several other light sources, especially an incandescent lamp, it'll look blue-ish.  Second, the 3M tape on the back is horrid.  Almost every strand fell down at some point and I ended up using gorilla glue to hang it - which worked, but only after gluing my fingers together four or five times.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Certainly.  For the price, the spectrum and hanging issues become inconsequential.  But be aware, it's not perfect.
