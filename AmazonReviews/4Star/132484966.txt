Buy once, cry once as they say. It's expensive but you get what you pay for. Chasing down a hum in your signal chain? Clean power and isolated grounds are a huge step in the right direction.<br />I run a pedalboard with a few boxes out in front and a few in the loop along with a Line6 wireless unit with my Mesa 2 channel Dual Rectifier. Running AC power to the board using a cheap-o OneSpot adapter gave me nothing but headaches in the form of a nasty hum. I tried using a cheaper JOYO power supply that supposedly had isolated grounds on all of its outputs but that didn't solve the problem. As soon as I upgraded to the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 4x4, virtually ALL signal hum was gone.<br />Highly recommended.
