I have an old Squier Affinity series Stratocaster that I used as a learning tool and beat around who cares what happens to it guitar. The pickups and electronics after years of abuse and what not got rusted. I just got this today and installed it. Package says it's made by Sage Music in Korea. Everything worked. You're not going to get Seymour Duncan or Fender Custom out of this so don't expect it at the price. But honestly I'm happy with the sound. It's definitely a slightly better upgrade from Squier. Just a warning: the screw holes don't matchup perfectly so you'll need to fenagle it a bit.
