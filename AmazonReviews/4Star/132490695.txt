You can't see it. I can stand the ones that hang off the top of the guitar like a giant tumor. It looks very unprofessional in my opinion. This little guy tucks under the head stock and hides itself. You don't  need to take it off and loose it.<br /><br />I play bass and the tuner picks up everything but my Low B (on 5 and 6 string) well. I just have to hit the B string on the 12th fret and it picks it up fine. I have used this tuner on everything from classical, to electric guitar, to bass.<br /><br />Don't get this tuner if you play in a loud environment. It won't distinguish between you and the other instruments. other than that, this tuner does what it is supposed to.
