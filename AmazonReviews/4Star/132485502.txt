I originally had this model in China.  When I moved back to the USA, it was easier and cheaper to sell that one and buy a new one here.  The fine detail work on this new one is lower quality than the original I had, and the wood grain was better.<br /><br />However, I am pleased with this guzheng, and I was extremely happy with the directions in both Chinese and English that came with it to facilitate set-up of both the guzheng and the tuner that was included in the package.  All of the included items have been fantastic, especially the tuner and stand.  The bridges are decent, and they're easy to move to adjust tuning.  There's a chart on the guzheng and in the manual that clearly explains how to arrange the bridges, and it gives care instructions as well.<br /><br />This is a fantastic guzheng package for beginners, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who's curious about this awesome instrument!
