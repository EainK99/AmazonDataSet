I've had this for a few days and it's a fun light. My 2 year old nephew got hold of it and threw it down the stairs (don't ask), and although the plastic dome cracked in several places, it still works! There's a delay on sound activation mode and there's a mild sound when it's doing its thing (when playing music you can't hear it); besides that, I'm impressed.
