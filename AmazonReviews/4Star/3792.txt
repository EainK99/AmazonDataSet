This is a very comfortable guitar,with quality electronics!! It took a little to get used to because of its size,but like they say big things come in small packages.While it won't replace a Gibson Hummingbird but then again,it didn't cost as much ,I feel this guitar could be used solidly as a main instrument ,and definitely worth adding to an arsenal.The only downfall the thin sound unplugged but then again it is a thin line,plugged in its a very pleasant surprise,remember this is the 5 not the 10 but as happy as I am with the 5 and I don't need a tree of life inlay ,in my opinion it suits all of my needs.Mr Vai and Ibanez hit a home run in my humble opinion.
