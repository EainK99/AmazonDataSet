I bought this keyboard about a year and a half ago, and i have no major complaints for it. The sound samples that come with it are amazing, especially the grand piano sound. BUT... the reason i give it four stars is because there is no midi input output. That can become a pain after a while. And the semi weighted keys can begin to strain you hands if you play for more than an hour or two at a time. Weighted keys absorbs shock, and these keys not so much.<br /><br />Well thats my opinion of it. Still an awesome keyboard
