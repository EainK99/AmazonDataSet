just the loudness I need.  I'm happy with the tweeter size and the sound the overall speaker produces.  for a monitor is very good.  I like them.  i will buy some more at a later time.  the only problem is the in and out aren't marked.  the &#34;in&#34; is the jack closest to the front fo the monitor.
