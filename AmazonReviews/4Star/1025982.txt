First of all I am not a professional in anyway.<br /><br />But I really do take a lot of video weather it's just friends goofing around, my grandson playing in the backyard, or something we see when we're out hiking.<br /><br />I always used the built-in mic In whatever camera I was using at the time. After getting the Audio-Technica AT8024 Stereo/Mono Camera-Mount Microphone I really see the deficiencies in the built-in mic .<br /><br />The sound quality is fantastic and it picks up sounds I was losing with the built-in mic.<br /><br />Now I really notice the difference in the audio quality with all of my previous videos. I wish I could go back in time and redo them.<br /><br />It's a pricey piece of tech but if you're remotely serious about audio quality you should grab one.
