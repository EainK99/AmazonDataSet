Overall - Quality little music machine with decent steel strings that seems to hold a tune well.<br /><br />However - We picked up a strap and had it embroidered with our daughter's name.  Pulled the guitar out of the box for her birthday and, lo and behold, there is no neck-end lug to mount the strap to opposite the one on the bottom.  Either a poorly thought out bit of cost-cutting, or a small omission during the manufacture of the guitar we received.  Without the strap lug, a bit tricky for our daughter to keep ahold of.
