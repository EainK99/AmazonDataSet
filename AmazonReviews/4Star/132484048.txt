I agree with the other reviewers that this is most definitely a ukulele rather than a mini-guitar. It is so adorable, and despite being made of plastic feels very durable.<br /><br />I did find the ukulele hard to tune (and yes, I do actually own a real ukulele and know how to tune an instrument). I suspect this is due to the kid-friendly nylon strings. I was able to get it close enough to in tune to make it not sound horrible (like it initially did out of the box) but it took some fiddling and a few different tries. Also, once the uke was strummed heavily by a two year old two of the strings had jumped over and were being held with the other strings so it took some untwisting to get them back where they belonged. Again, I think different strings and less slack would solve this problem.<br /><br />However, your kid probably isn't going to be the next Jack Johnson and he or she just wants something to strum, play with, make some noise with, and have fun and this totally fits the bill! This is the type of thing that would make a wonderful Christmas or birthday present.<br /><br />Also, it totally unboxed super easy! One piece of tape holds some cardboard around the neck and that's it!
