I have had this pedal for several years and I have a love/hate relationship with it. Accuracy was key for me and this pedal is VERY accurate compared to other pedal tuners in this price range. That's the love,...now the hate. My complaint is that when I run it in the isolated 'Tuner Out' of my Ernie Ball Volume Pedal Jr. and leave it on, it produces a noise as soon as the LED lights kick on (pitch of noise is right at E2/82Hz). I prefer to leave it on all the time and use my volume pedal to mute for silent tuning b/c I like to see the pitch displayed as I'm playing on long sustained fretted notes, or when playing slide so I can monitor my intonation in real time. Unfortunately the noise is so bad that I have to turn it off after tuning (which makes the 'tuner out' function useless). It doesn't make sense to me that since it isn't even passing signal through to anything that it would have this kind of audible effect. I'd rather not run it in line with everything else because I'd like to keep the signal chain to a minimum. So Love = accuracy and functionality, Hate = noisy in this application. For now love trumps hate and I'm just turning it on/off when I need it but I am on the hunt for an alternative.
