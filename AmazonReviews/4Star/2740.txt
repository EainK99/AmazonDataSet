I bought these to help dampen the sound in my bedroom and for my computer.<br />They appear to work ok but not as well as I expected. I wanted them to help absorb extra sound and sound reverberations off the walls. maybe I don't have enough or expected to much.<br />They do look pretty cool for foam panels.
