I bought these for a home brew Les Paul that has metric parts.The guitar is white on the front, and metallic burnt orange on the back, so I wanted something close to match it.These amber knobs for metric pots are the only ones I could locate on the web.I am happy with them, and they matched up great.They also arrived a three weeks early from Japan.
