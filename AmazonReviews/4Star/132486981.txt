I thoroughly researched boards before I went with the RP500. At first I wanted to build my own rig but couldn't shell out $1000+ for a customized stompbox chain. This is really the next best thing, though. I love the simplified features and how easy it is to customize your sounds. I'm not really into all the amp modelling, but some of them provide a good base to build out your tone. If you find a preset you like, it takes a few minutes of fidgeting with the dials to fine tune it. If you have 3 or 4 go-to sounds you normally use, just line them up in a row, and switching back and forth is a breeze. The thing I like most about the RP500 is that you can set up a sound you like and add or remove distortion, delay, reverb, and chorus on the fly. This makes blending with a band easy and quick. The tap tempo switch is great too. There are a couple flaws that kept me from giving it 5 stars. First, I don't like the tuner. For such an advanced pedal, the tuner feels archaic and jittery. Then, there's the Wah pedal. Digitech should have made the wah activation less sensitive so that you have to apply some pressure to use it. I find it really annoying that everytime I use the volume pedal for swells I end up turning on wah and mess up the sound. There may be a way to adjust that, I don't know. Overall a great pedal at a fair price.
