Really I cannot understand all these negative comments, and agree entirely with Nicolas (April 8, 2011) who dismisses them with qualified responses, point by point.<br /><br />The program took a long time to install and registration was a bit of a pain, but nothing too difficult (and I'm not really what you'd call a techie). When first trying out this software, Word Builder, integrated perfectly into Play, worked first time and matched my expectations. I would have liked the Harlem Gospel Choir but that would be hoping for too much. (Maybe some time soon, EWQL?). These choirs are very straight-laced, RP-speaking Americans. What else would they be in such a package as this? If you want exactly the right diction on all words, or you want to change the accent, you'll need to work on the phonetic editor or their own phonic system (VOTOX) - again, would you seriously expect otherwise?<br /><br />I'm pretty much a novice to VSTs and digital-audio multi-tracking, in general, but all three of the instrument packages I have from EWQL (Symphonic Choirs, Symphonic Orchestras Silver & Ministry of Rock 2) are very high quality, and were no more difficult to get up and running than an equivalent system such as Native Instruments' Kontakt.  MOR2 is particularly impressive and has astonishingly good sounds & features. Also, EWQL's new host (Play, version 4) works well at every level, and is better and smoother than Version 3.<br /><br />I can only think the naysayers would rather they kept these very useful composition/band arrangement tools to themselves. Maybe I should do the same.....ooops.
