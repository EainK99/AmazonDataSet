This bag is a very simplistic, yet, durable bag. Have had it for years with moderate gigging and it shows no wear.<br /><br />My only \\"gripe\\" is that it doesn't have any shallow pockets for drum keys, moon gel packs, etc. You have to \\"fish\\" for them in the deep pockets provided.<br /><br />I have about 5 pairs of sticks in each of the end pockets.<br /><br />All in all, a very good, durable, and cheap stick bag.
