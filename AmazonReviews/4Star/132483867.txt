I bought this set of drums as a gift and all in all they are pleased with the set but said the directions were insanely difficult to maneuver through.  After several days of trying, several online tutorials and 27-40 adult beverages, the project of assembly was complete.<br /><br />I would suggest that whomever wrote the instructions maaaaaaaybe find a new job because they are just that bad.
