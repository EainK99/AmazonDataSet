This pop filter serves its purpose, and it does it well.<br /><br />So when I first opened the package and installed it onto my mic stand, the pop filter was moving all over the place and could not hold its self up, so I found a fix. Use needle nose pliers to tighten down the pop filter very tight, and make sure the pop filter is all the way screwed into its mount or will will spin all over the place. Also, attach the pop filter directly above or below the mic you are using, if you attatch it from the side over time you may have issues with it dropping downwards.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this product for anyone that wants a nice add on to your professional mic. It really keeps the P's from Popping.
