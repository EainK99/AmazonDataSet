This pinspot light works very well and adds nice color to the disco ball but even with the narrow lens it needs to be mounted close to the ball in order for it to cover the ball well. When the colors change automatically they will at times shine off to the side of the ball but all in all this works fairly well for this application and I would give it a 5 star rating if the light were a little brighter and shine a little more pin pointed on the source.
