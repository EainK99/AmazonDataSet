I'll get the caveat out of the way first: used with both a top and bottom felt this 'topper' will attenuate the sustain and wash on cymbals. If you play a style of music that is enhanced by over- and undertones this device will alter your cymbal sound. Of course this is a plus to folks who play heavier and louder music, and especially so when you want a dry ping from your ride. If you are in the latter category read on because this is a time saver.<br /><br />The operation is a lot simpler than the photos of this attachment make it appear. There is a swing style lever on the top. Place it in the vertical position with the bottom felt in place, slide the cymbal's mounting hole over it and then the top felt, push down with a slight twist and flip the retaining lever to horizontal. No wing nuts to lose or spin. Just a simple operation that takes mere seconds.<br /><br />Installation is also simple. You simply screw this down on your cymbal stand's post where the wing nut normally goes and you are done. Do be aware that this will only work with modern stands with 8mm threads. Vintage stands and some lightweight modern stands use 6mm threaded posts and this will NOT work with those. Measure before you make your purchase.<br /><br />Overall this is a godsend to many drummers, but those of us who are playing jazz or have more money tied up in a small number of 'grail' cymbals will probably want to look elsewhere.
