I've used many different field recorders and this one keeps up with any higher priced model at a much lower cost. As far as settings go, it has everything you can ask for with a very user-friendly interface. The only thing I would warn people about is this stereo mic that's built in sounds like it's recording through plastic because of the body of the device. This isn't really an issue because of the extra two inputs. The stereo mic is fine for field recordings but for professional audio you will want to use your own mic. The body feels a little bit thin and light but it seems to be holding up just fine. I would recommend this device.
