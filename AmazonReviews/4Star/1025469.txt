This is a good big print tuner. You won't be the cool kid using this.<br /><br />The tuner is very accurate and durable. If you need to tune say a guitar quickly at a gig, there are too many buttons. That isn't a problem at home practicing. Battery life is outstanding - you'd hate to have to change the battery a lot. The screen is really bright and easy to read.<br /><br />It is rather large and, well, lame looking (that's a style comment - some might think big and colorful is awesome). The big text on it is the equivalent of buying a large print edition of a book. Of course those large print editions are easier to read, but you have to haul around a lot more paper.
