Purchased this on a lark.  I'm no whiz with wiring up things, and the instructions, while helpful still left me with a couple important questions so I had my local guitar shop do it instead.  I had him install the 'hot' setting (there are a few to choose from ranging from mild to industrial, hot being in the middle) with a 250k push pull pot and I must stay by itself its a bit anemic.  Cranked up I can hear a little bit of distortion in chords, most noticeably in the neck pickup(Seymour Duncan jazz) but where it really shines is when combined with another pedal.  Used in conjunction with a boost or overdrive pedal like an EHX Soul Food for example, and it adds that extra oomph to your tone.  Worth the price for that as I was a little underwhelmed by the soul food to begin with, it just couldn't get crunchy enough, now that isn't a problem.  Try it out, but I'd probably recommend the Industrial setting for a more noticeable distortion though.
