Ok, just to give you the heads up before going through the hassle of returning this product because you think its broken. Firstly, when you fill the tank and plug it in the yellow \\"low fluid\\" light will come on. Don't worry, its not broken. I thought it was because the light was on and the tank was filled to the top. The light will FLASH when the fluid is low. The yellow indicator light comes on automatically when you plug it in. The light turns off when unit is heated up and blinks when fluid is low.Secondly, you have to wait a LONG time for it to heat up. Don't worry, it's not broken. Many people say it takes 2 to 5 minutes to warm up. Mine took over 10 minutes.<br />All in all, the unit works, the output of fog is great! I have a party coming up in a few weeks and plan on making a chiller box to use in the front yard. Will give you an update then. May go from 4 to 5 stars or 4 to 3. We will see.<br />UPDATE:Just started the fogger up a second time (24hrs later). This time yellow light did not come on at all. Not sure why, but the fogger still worked well. Still took a while to heat up though. Not sure whats up with the yellow light.
