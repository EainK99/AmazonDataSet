I bought these for my then 9 month old son (now 11 months). He really likes them. They fit in his hand well and he can shake them easily. Now after having them two months, he doesn't play with them as much, but I think that's more a reflection of him rather than the toy. We keep one in the car nearly all the time so he can &#34;make music&#34;. I only gave 4 stars because I ordered blue maracas but red-pink ones were sent to us instead. Not a big deal so we kept them rather than exchanging. My son doesn't know the difference!
