I ordered one of these to make a \\"hard-of-hearing\\" station for our local small church. There's one gal in particular (literally months away from topping 100) who has a bit of a problem hearing the minister - even with the PA system cranked. I'm doing this mainly for her, but I think I may add to the inventory after this little project gets off the ground. I plan to mount the item upside down onto the back of the pew in front of where the user will sit. (Upside down because of how all the wires will hook up and be run. Check it out.) Of course, I'm covering the outer case with wide, white vinyl tape and adding new control indicator markings with a label maker. Well, DUH.<br /><br />BEHRINGER seems to be able to make stuff for less than HALF that of anybody else and still come up with great products. Go figure. 'Zat mean the other manufacturers are making way too much on their's. ('Question of the day for martketing, 'eh?)<br /><br />All told, I haven't even tried the thing out - and have already dug into it enough to void the warranty. 'Not the slightest bit concerned, though. 'Always have extremely good luck with BEHRINGER products.<br /><br />(And, no, they're not paying me to say these things.)
