[[VIDEOID:912ef6682e15d34bc8e1fe5a4df73e2f]] I'm using this box to create a cool effect on my TV backlight. Behind the TV is 4 strips of RGB SMD5050 connected with \\"RGB strip jumper connectors\\". It took me awhile to figure out how to connect everything to the box. I'm new to LED lighting and pretty novice at most things electrical. The box only accepts stripped wires that then push into their respective slot. I had to cut a connector off of one of my prewired \\"jumper\\" cables and strip them down to the wire before hooking them into the RGB slots. Same thing with power cord. I had to cut the power cable and expose the positive and negative before plugging them in. The only other negative is my colored buttons on the remote are all messed up. You never know what color you'll get. It could be that one of the RGB cables are swapped?<br /><br />As for the music function it's great. For $15, it far exceeded my expectations. It takes awhile to dial in a sensitivity that works best for your setup. Once you got it, I'd say it follows the music 90% of the time. It's not super smart, so complex music might confuse it. Newer, \\"fuller\\" music works better. Listening to older, tinny music doesn't create many light changes. More modern mixes with deeper base tends to get it rocking pretty good.
