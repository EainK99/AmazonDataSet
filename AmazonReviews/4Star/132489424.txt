I want so badly to give this 5 stars. As far as ease of use and practicality goes this is a fantastic system. The only reason that I cannot give this item a 100% positive review is because of one simple problem I've had with it. This may be a rare problem but on my transmitter, it seems that the compartment for the batteries is slightly undersized. This creates an excess of pressure on the plastic battery compartment door when it's closed and clipped into place. Thus, after residual use (and with this system you WILL find yourself going through batteries) the battery compartment door has split. Without the door, the connection between the batteries is lost and you have no power. My device hasn't gotten to the point where it is completely unusable but that's only because I've stopped using it. I have no doubt that if I continued using it as I have in the past that the battery compartment door would break further rendering it useless. Right now it's only held together because of the thin metal band that acts as the bridge between batteries.<br /><br />Again, I've not read another review stating this problem as of yet. So mine may be an isolated case. Either way, I cannot give this product 5 stars after having experienced this issue with my own.<br /><br />I hope you find this useful.<br /><br />Everything else about this product gets 5 stars as far as I'm concerned. Just not the issue I've explained.
