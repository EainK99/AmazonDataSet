These are really great headphones for the price. I listen to a lot of classical music, so I wanted something not bass heavy, and they fit the bill.<br /><br />Be aware that the cord is very long and heavy (at least 6', if not more) - I didn't pay attention to the details when placed the order. That said it's very easy to fix this with a soldering iron.
