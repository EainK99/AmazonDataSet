I have owned several real analog and modeling synths and will say that you can get some great synth sounds out of this pedal. That said, it has a time and place; you can only use it with simple riffs and you have to play clean for it to track well. It's understandable, because unlike effects pedals that just warp your existing electrical signal, this thing generates it's own signal from scratch based on internal oscillators. It uses the incoming bass signal as a trigger and if you have ever seen what an electrical signal looks like coming out of a bass, you would understand why it is difficult to obtain an ultra reliable trigger.
