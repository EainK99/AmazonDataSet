I'm enjoying my Cube 40GX a lot, and I do recommend it.  However, I spent a lot of time comparing the features of the 40GX, the 40XL, the 80GX, and the 80XL; mostly, I made the right choice for me but I missed the fact that Roland actually REMOVED features when they went from 40XL to the 40GX; specifically, there's no looper.  Though all the other features are stellar, especially at the price, this was a particular disappointment as I was looking forward to using looping in practice.  I didn't return it, and maybe there's a loop pedal in my future, but if this is something you're expecting - don't.
