It's really good. I just got it out the mail and it works fine. My only concern was that I couldn't a shorter version preferably 6-feet but I guess that's ok. I mean this is the only one here I could find where mostly all the reviews were good and I could see why. I'll have to wait a couple of months before I say anything else but for now &#34;I like it&#34; 4 stars.
