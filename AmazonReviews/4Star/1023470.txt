Product was as advertised. Easy to use. You have to wait about 15 or so seconds between tuning strings or you can get an incorrect reading. Instructions on exactly where is the best place to attach the tuner on different instruments would be very helpful. I found it to be very easy to use and quick, I tuned one string to the tuner and then the other strings to the tuned string, very quick. I would buy again.
