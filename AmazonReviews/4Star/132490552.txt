The good:<br /><br />-It's very cute. The pineapple shape and the laser etching are both eye catching. Whenever I take it anywhere, people always comment on it.<br /><br />-Which brings me to the next thing: I can take it anywhere. I know the description says it's made of mahogany, but it is laminate wood. That means several layers of wood are glued together instead of one solid piece. The glue absorbs vibrations so laminate does not resonate and sound as good as solid wood instruments. However it takes a very discerning ear to notice/hear the difference. The benefits of laminate are that it is humidity resistant and low maintenance. You don't have to worry about it and can tote it wherever you go.<br /><br />-Which brings me to the third thing: This comes with a gig bag. It's a flimsy thing, but it does the job and since this is a laminate instrument, it's enough for what you need. It also comes with a pitch pipe, which I don't recommend using as your sole source of tuning. Get a [[ASIN:B003VWJ2K8 Snark SN-1 Tuner]], or some other chromatic tuner. They're not expensive and well worth having.<br /><br />-I like it that this has more fret markers. Most ukuleles have 3 markers at the 5th, 7th and 10th frets. This has 5 markers, at the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th and 12th. This is very rare in soprano models and frankly, I don't understand why more don't have it. I love it! It's especially helpful when you're reading tab.<br /><br />Now the bad:<br /><br />-The finish on it isn't stellar. Mine actually has a spot on the base of the neck where it's a bit splintery. I have to be careful not to run my hands along it or else, ouch!<br /><br />-The tuning isn't stellar. I've never picked this up and it not be a little out of tune. On more expensive models, like my Kala Lacewood, I could go a week without touching the tuners. But not this one. You really have to check it each and every time you play it.<br /><br />All that said, I would recommend this ukulele to a beginner in a heartbeat. Sure, it's got some bad aspects but for price, it's really hard to beat this one.tbeat. Sure, it's got some bad aspects but for price, it's really hard to beat this one.
