For almost 10 years I used the hard Selmer case that came with my alto sax when I first got it.  Then I finally got to college and realized that there was no way I could walk around a huge campus without a way to carry my sax on my back.<br /><br />To start out, they really should add to the description that his has the ability to be carried like a backpack.  I really like how you can use the velcro to keep the straps out of the way when you're not carrying it on your back.  It's also nice it comes with a strap that you can use too.  I'm on the short side, so using the shoulder strap is not ideal for me.  It's also great to have some pockets.  It comfortable fits all my rehearsal needs including flipbook, lyre, extra reeds, and neck strap.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the neck is kinda tight fitting in the holder.  I have a Selmer Aristocrat AS500 and the octave key is a little wide for the space.  You just have to push it into the compartment for it in the case and it's fine.<br /><br />Overall, the case is great quality and a good price.
