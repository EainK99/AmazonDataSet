For the price point, this guitar is great. No rolled fret egdes, or ornate binding, no frills at all other than real solid tone. I recommend it to anyone just starting to learn 12 string, get a guitar strap as this is not a lap sitting guitar for the round in the middle kind of guy....like me. It has 2 strap buttons so there is no need for shoe lace strings at the nut. A good guitar overall.
