The case is very well designed! It has that long pocket up near the headstock for a big fat strap. The main pocket has all these other pockets for tools and stuff. It has enough room in it for me to put 1 pedal and two cables, plus the other stuff, then still has the outer netting for holding stuff. I have a strat and it is perfect. There is the traditional pocket beneath where the neck rests, too.<br />The only negative I have probably applies to all back pack style cases - and I was careful each time I picked it up to not drop it on the straps knowing they are the weak point and the stitching can break loose. I think one of the few times someone else carried it for me did one side in. I'm on the way to the shoe maker's to have it repaired. It appears to be stitched well, but care needs be taken. If not for this, it would have been 5 stars. I would still buy one again. I've owned it for about 2 years.
