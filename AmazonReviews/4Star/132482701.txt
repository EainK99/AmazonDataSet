The news flash is, \\"The new Ukadelic models will be Makala not Kala.\\"<br />The Tattoo is now a \\"RETIRED\\" Kala model because the entire Ukadelic series has been revamped for the 2014 model year.  I liked the Tattoo and Tuxedo versions about the best of the first wave of Ukadelic by Kala instruments just because they were not flashy designs. Your mileage may vary on which graphics you prefer, but all soprano Ukadelics are basically the same underneath the different graphics.<br /><br />The revamped Ukadelic second wave model on the way to dealers now has been positioned in the budget Makala line instead of the Kala line and will start MK instead of KA.  The Makala section of the Kala website shows the new Ukadelic line with new specs and graphics.  The original wood laminate bodied Kala based Ukadelic series is a goner.  The new Ukadelics are built to very different specs based on an existing Makala model instead of an existing Kala.<br /><br />The specs on the new Ukadelic body include \\"an injection molded back and sides with an agathis laminate top.\\"  If that sounds familiar it is because it is exactly the same as the Makala Dolphin build specs.  The bridge is different from the Dolphin model on the new Ukadelics, but otherwise they are the same construction under the finish as a Dolphin.  Also the Ukadelic MK models will continue to come with Aquila strings instead of the black nylon GHS Hawaiian strings that are stock on the Dolphin base model.<br /><br />The 2011 wood laminate Kala based Ukadelic retail was $125 and the new Makala Dolphin based version Ukadelic retail is almost certain to be lower, something like $80 to $100 is entirely likely, but the retail hasn't been announced yet.<br /><br />This Tattoo Ukadelic by Kala is a very decent laminate body soprano and I feel very lucky I got it.  I can very strongly recommend both Kala and Makala ukes in general.  I've bought other brands but the Kala and Makala ukes I own are clear standouts in their respective price ranges.  Stick to Kala or Makala and buy the best one of those two brands that you can afford.  That is my advice.  Even the cheapest Makala will play and sound as good as some other brands that cost more.  Even the cheapest Makala ukes won't hold beginners back like some hard to play instruments can.<br /><br />Kala's base level is the MAKALA branded series.  Makala branded ukes are actually good enough for the majority of players.  Then a step up from Makala branded ukes are the ones with the Kala brand.  Within the Kala brand itself are several quality levels from all laminate bodies on the budget end to solid exotic tonewood construction professional premium models that frankly are more uke than a hobby player like me truly needs.  However if money was no object I'd splurge on several high end solid wood Kala models.<br /><br />This particular uke, the Ukadelic by Kala Tattoo model, is one of the first Ukadelic designs introduced into the Kala line back in 2011. It is a Kala based all laminate bodied uke with unique looks, affordability and good tone.  The Tattoo is one of the least \\"visually busy\\" of the original Ukadelic series with the simple tribal design stripe down the center of the top, the rest of the ukulele body being a low profile flat black finish with a flat black headstock.  It is a simple and classy look.<br /><br />These first-wave Kala Ukadelics, including this Tattoo model, are really good playing instruments with Aquila Nylgut strings. They have an all wood laminate body (nato or poplar) with a mahogany neck and rosewood bridge and rosewood fingerboard with nickle silver frets.  No plastic in the body.  The new Ukadelics will be a Dolphin underneath a graphic finish with a classic rectangular bridge and Aquila strings. The new Ukadelics come with the infamous Makala gigbag which is barely any protection at all.  The first-wave Kala Ukadelics come with no bag at all, so you'll want to get one.  (Actually once you see the included Makala bag you'll want one for it too.)<br /><br />In a side note Kala is also bringing out an all new model.  The MAKALA SHARK version of the Dolphin will come in softer satin colors with a Shark shaped bridge instead of the cute but somewhat juvenile dolphin shaped bridge.  The SHARK model will be listed as the MK-SS model.  So there will be the Dolphin, the Shark and the Ukadelic all built on the same hybrid body platform.  They will all sound very similar if setup with the same strings.<br /><br />The Dolphin has become one of the best selling ukes in the world for good reason.  It is a great value even at retail, but I don't know if switching the Ukadelic series to the Dolphin platform was a good idea.  I love my Dolphin, but it is essentially a partly plastic bodied uke that is pretty loud but has a mellow tone and plays good for the money.  My yellowburst Dolphin is fun to play but it isn't as nice as my new Kala Ukadelic in tone or the playability of the factory setup and it isn't all because of the different strings. While my Dolphin is a really good uke for the money, the Kala Ukadelic is obviously the better sounding and better playing instrument between the two.  And the Tattoo model should be better since it lists for over twice the list of a Dolphin.<br /><br />If you'd prefer an all wood laminate bodied uke and you like any of the original Ukadelic graphic finishes, you'd better grab one quickly.  They are no longer being made by Kala and when existing inventories are gone that is all she wrote.<br /><br />I got a Tattoo Ukadelic yesterday because I found out they were being discontinued and I've had my eye on the Tattoo for a long time as my next soprano. The fit, finish, tone and out of the box playability of my Tattoo is outstanding! The Aquila Nylgut strings are nice too.  While I use Aquilas on two other ukes, they are not the only string I use or like.<br /><br />There are better ukes than these first-wave Ukadelic by Kala models, even a mid-range solid top Kala is better, so I really can't give the Tattoo 5 stars when compared to all ukes.  I don't think the second wave of the Ukadelics, the ones built on the Makala Dolphin polycarbonate injection molded/agathis top hybrid platform, will be as good as these first wave Ukadelics, but they'll still be better than lots of the other ukes on the market.<br /><br />I know this review won't be up long because the model itself won't be around much longer, but wanted to get the word out about the big change being made in the Ukadelic series and about the new SHARK model coming soon.<br /><br />I love my Dolphin and it has been my everyday player but I think this Kala Tattoo Ukadelic is a slightly better uke on several levels and frankly suits me better personality wise.  Yes ukes have a personality just like people.  A Dolphin is the best uke for the money and makes you feel great inside, but the Ukadelic version of the Dolphin will be pricier than a basic Dolphin and yet at the core it will still be a dressed up Dolphin.  A Dolphin isn't such a bad thing to be though.  This first-wave Tattoo version was a very easy purchase for me to make.  Kala and Makala...both make me happy!  It comes down to how much you want to spend and whether you prefer the loud throaty style tone of the partly plastic Dolphin or the brighter all laminate wood tone of the Kala.  Either are good values.g you'll want one for it too.)<br /><br />In a side note Kala is also bringing out an all new model.
