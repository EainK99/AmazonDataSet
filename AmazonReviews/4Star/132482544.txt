It holds mic stands, but your have to FULLY DISASSEMBLE your mic stands, in order to fit the pre-sewn socks/slots.<br /><br />My mic stand, is a typical setup:<br />Round base.<br />Bottom post with extension post inside<br />Top screw on collar that contains the boom (leading to the mic)<br /><br />The problem I found, was that you MUST disconnect the BOOM from the Boon Colar, otherwise the long boom will not completely sink/slide down into the pocket in this back.  Kind of like putting a roll of xmas paper into a tube sock.  Anyway.... This is a big hassle, having to disconnect the boom from the boom colar...  so what I did, was to SLICE OPEN the pocket/socket by another 6&#34; or so, so that the boom collar does not interfere with the sock/pocket.<br /><br />I also use this bag to carry other equip in addition to my mic stand:<br />ipad holder attachment<br />Laptop holder<br />guitar straps.<br />guitar stand tripod.<br /><br />The reason I decided to modify it, was because I wanted to consolidate all of my long items into one back, instead of making 10 trips to the car, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />The bag is made of durable outer material and has solid, cord-type handles, although the handles seem a little long and Purse-like.  It does the job.
