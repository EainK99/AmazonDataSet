I should mention I am not using them for their intended purpose, but instead for holding marching bass drums when our marching band is in the stands.  The keyboard stands were easy to put together.  They work well.  The adjuster knob has broken off of several of them (I bought 8) but I think it is because 14-17 year old kids don't always treat things as carefully as they should.  I'm sure if an adult was using this as a keyboard stand and taking care to not break it, it would be great.  Can't beat the price!
