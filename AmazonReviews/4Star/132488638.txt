I began to take singing seriously just a little over a year ago (mostly in Japanese), and wanted a good mic for starting off. I got this, and was surprised at how small it was. I got a pop filter too, and set it up on a camera tripod i had laying around the house. since then, it's worked great. I like the music creator program it comes with, because of the good effects for mixing it down nicely. I like how it has absolutely no latency, so you can hear yourself while you record, and have no delay. It picks up background noise a bit, but what do you expect for the price? It also picks up my low range nicely, but not so much on my higher end, unfortunately. It has lasted me this long without a problem, and it's as simple as a mic can get- just plug n' play. I will eventually get a better one, but I can't complain too much about this for now. For beginners to singing, or for people who podcast, I highly recommend this! hope this helps.
