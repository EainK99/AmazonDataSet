This seems like a pretty good mandolin for a beginner, and is priced well for the quality. It sounds nice, and after lowering the bridge and tuning, it was perfect. I will say there were some minimal scratches around the body, but nothing serious. I would also highly suggest buying new strings when purchasing this mandolin because you'll need them. The G and D strings were pretty worn and left  black marks on my fingers. Then within a day of practicing, the loop of an E string snapped mid-playing.
