I've had an MXL condenser mic for 10 years or so. The threads in the hard mount stripped, and as a result, made the mic difficult to use. Duct tape was a quick fix that lasted until I finally found the replacement. I know I'm not reviewing the MXL large diaphragm condenser mic, but I gotta say for fifty bucks I love it. I have a Shure KSM 32 that is awesome, but it will pickup ant footsteps. The MXL is a lot less sensitive, which is often just what the doctor ordered.
