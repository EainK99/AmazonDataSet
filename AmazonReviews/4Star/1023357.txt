These dimmers work very well on extremely smooth, flat, glossy surfaces (such as over the camera on an iMac screen or the dark translucent plastic in many cable boxes), but they do not work at all in any way in applications where the LED is rounded or where the surface is not shiny slick plastic or glass.  They require a glossy smooth surface to mate with and stick - the material is very similar to that used in the children's toy &#34;Colorforms&#34; (but thinner).<br /><br />I was hoping to use these on some stereo equipment with rounded LEDs and on some power strips with annoyingly brilliant LEDs, but it's just not possible if the surface isn't completely flat and shiny smooth.  I don't begrudge the physics behind how they stick without adhesive, but the seller should make it clearer where these will work and where they will fail.  Otherwise, a great idea that helps tame at least some of the Las Vegas aspect of LEDs proliferating on electronic devices, and they are working very well for me in some places.<br /><br />Having both tinted and blackout material provides the most flexibility - some things you just want GONE and other things you want to still be able to see or read without them glaring at you in low light.
