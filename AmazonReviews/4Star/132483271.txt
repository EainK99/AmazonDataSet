I think this product is great if you want the pioneer work flow for a budget price. i've seen other reviews that mention latency or tight jog friction, but I didn't experience anything of the sort. I did have one complaint about it, but it's definitely my personal preference to have 4 cues but oh well. what can you do? lol anyways I would definitely recommend this product to the DJ on a budget who wants pioneer experience. disclaimer... doesn't come with USB cables to connect via MIDI; buy some, enjoy this product
