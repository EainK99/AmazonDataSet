Fits my Luna Trinity 12 string with just enough room to leave the strap on, which is a bonus.  Nicely padded.  Quite heavy, but I guess that's the price you pay for the protection.  Hardware seems strong and well attached.  Cover doesn't *quite* close correctly without a bit of adjusting, that's the only reason it's not 5 star.  You sort of have to bring it over to get it to slip down over.  May just be because it's brand new.
