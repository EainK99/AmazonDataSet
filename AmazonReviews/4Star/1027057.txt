This is a good ocarina, it is realy pritty and it's realy easy to pick it up and play a little something even if it isn't an actual song. If you or someone you live with is sensative to high pitches this might not be the best thing for you. Also it sounds nice, but it sounds a lot like my recorder I had in fith grade.
