Great sounding Ukulele, surprisingly loud. I bought mine a guitar store and tried it versus many other ukes and bought it for superior sound. The only negative thing I could say is that it is REALLY dark and the finish is not as pretty as My Oscar Schmidt Concert at the same price point.If you are a beginner I would recommend a concert size Uke for a first instrument.
