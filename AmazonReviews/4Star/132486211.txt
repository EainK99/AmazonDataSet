The sticks do cut down the volume almost in half. I had to wrap the ends with tape leaving 1/2 inch exposed because after 2 hours use the ends were beginning to splay and they were starting to sound more like brushes. No way to get the stick/rim sound for mellow songs. I'm going to try to modify them some more to see if i can get some kind of rim sound.
