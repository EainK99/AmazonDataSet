It's what you would expect for a relatively inexpensive guitar case. It looks nice and the guitar fits snugly inside.  The hardware is nice and looks like it will last. On close inspection it looks like the glue used under the tolex was spread unevenly as there are numerous small lumps on the flat surfaces. All in all I'm happy with the purchase. I purchased the case for a Loar LH-250
