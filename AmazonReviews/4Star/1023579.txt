These are great headphones for the price.  They're comfortable and stay comfortable for over 1 hour.  The sound is clear; especially low notes which I sometimes have difficulty hearing on stereo.  I use them to listen to audio books while I'm commuting to and from work. Easy to adjust  I haven't listened to music with them, so I can't comment on that.  I'd buy them again.
