Shipping is great i got it 2 days before it was scheduled to show up.<br />The violin its self is awesome. The String were a little loose but can be fixed by tightened the pegs or the fine tuners. The violin is isn't a solid color black like i expected but rather it is sparkly black.The pegs works great unless you pull it to tight and then the string will break. The extra bridge and strings are awesome so if i accidentally break a piece i know i can fix it. The case is really well made its not high quality but it isn't low quality either, so its perfect for my purposes . Now, we've come to the the bow..... The bow was in horrible condition, it was missing horsehair, if it was even made out of horsehair. And even after rosin-ing it, it didn't sound right so i resorted to buying a new one. But overall this is the best student violin I've ever bought.
