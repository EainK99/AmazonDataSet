This is my 3rd pair and I have to say they have been great.  I have learned though that if you use these carts/needles with dirty vinyls, it will pick up dust like crazy and trap it in front of the needle.  When I put new vinyls on it was perfect as expected and had no pickup of dust.  I work on a regular basis at a nightclub using them 5 hours a night, 2-3x a week.<br /><br />I like how they come with new rubber covers as well, although it is always dicey putting those little things on at the end of the night, usually somewhat intoxicated.  Very easy to bend or break a needle when putting it on because you are putting it straight towards the exposed needle and it you even bump it, your needle will get bent. It's happened twice already to me, but luckily on a worn out needle both times, but still, it shouldn't be that easy to break...  4 stars instead of 5 because of that.
