I enjoy being able to listen to vinyl again.  But the built-in speakers leave something to be desired.  Don't get me wrong--they are adequate unless you are someone who must have &#34;The Sound&#34;.  Still, I recommend investing in a good pair of speakers.  They will definitely enhance the experience.
