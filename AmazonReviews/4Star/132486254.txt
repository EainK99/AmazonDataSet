**** NOT  A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW******<br /><br />This is a very functional carry case for anyone that owns the pioneer DDJ-SX. I needed to take several flights and was worried about checking in my DDJ-SX into the hold. Enter this carry case. It has a nicely padded compartment for the DDj-SX. In addition, it has a slot underneath that can fit a lap- top and enough pockets and compartments to hold the essentials you need to cary along with the DDj-SX and laptop.<br /><br />Another advantage it has is straps that allow you to convert the carry case into a back pack. Easiest way to carry that stuff and furthermore, with it on your back, you rarely, if ever, get hassled by airline staff. If you want it as a normal carry case, the straps have a nice compartment of their own to tuck them into. All in all, a nice bag to carry the DDJ-SX
