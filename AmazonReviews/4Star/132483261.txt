The Sony ECMCS3 Clip style Omnidirectional Stereo Microphone is a great performing little stereo mic, at a good price. I have tried several clip-on microphones over the past several months, and each has its ups and downs - except for the Sony ECMCS3, which surpasses them all.<br /><br />The sensitivity and gain of this mic is incredible. I generally clip it at the breastbone area or at the opening to a shirt breast pocket, and it picks up normal low-volume speaking with crystal clarity and great strength. The stereo feature is nice - not so much because you are speaking in stereo really, but because it fills both channels and makes the audio flow much more smoothly for the listener - especially if wearing headphones. The sound quality is very impressive, with rich full sound.<br /><br />The only minor complaint I have with the mic is the short cord.  This mic comes with a cord of about 2 ft. in length, which is fine if you are using a wireless transmitter, but if you are going to connect directly to a nearby device such as recorder or video camera - you will need an extension cable.<br /><br />The one complaint I have (and withheld a star for it) is that the clip is not the best. The clip is plastic and the spring is very weak. The weight of the mic can cause the clip to come loose and drop if you're not careful where you clip it. A minor complaint overall, but an annoyance when using it.<br /><br />This is the best clip-on mic I have tried, and I plan to order a second one.
