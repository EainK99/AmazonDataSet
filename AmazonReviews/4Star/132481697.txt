At some point most people making music will want a drum pad controller to go with their keyboard, so the question is, which one?<br /><br />I started with the padKontrol, then maschine, then the nanopad2.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />The nanopad2 is inexpensive, well built, and while the pads aren't the greatest thing since sliced bread they work for those who want to launch clips, or those on a budget who need a drum controller. The pads are responsive up to a point, but they are not as good as the padKontrol.<br /><br />If you're really into drumming get a padKontrol. If you want something that's easy, small, and inexpensive, get the nanopad2.<br /><br />I would avoid maschine. It's expensive and really doesn't give you much more than what you can do with software and a basic drum pad controller - even with its ability to sample and its soundbank /sequencer (which actually it makes things more complex).<br /><br />If I had to buy only one drum pad, I would get  the padKontrol. If I wanted a second I'd get the nanopad2.
