These strings are very good, have a good feel to them, the tone lasts for quite some time, they handle pretty well even with my acidic sweaty hands. But one thing i have problems with is tuning issues, but this is just be my experience and could be different for others. I know use Daddario 11-52 strings and aren't looking back but in the pursuit to find the perfect fear for YOU i would give these strings a try. Besides MY issue with tuning i loved everything about these strings.
