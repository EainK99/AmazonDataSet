Those of you who are giving this piece of software a one star review are likely expecting too much. No, it will not turn a pdf score into Sibelius notation in one magical poof, but to me it does a pretty darn good job at sorting out the notes and symbols on a score. Yes, it will make some mistakes. For example, it will sometimes mistake accidentals for extra notes. However, 95% of the score it reads very well. For the other 5%, the software gives you tools to correct the mistakes quickly and painlessly before you export it to Sibelius. It shows you where it thinks it made a mistake with a red box, and as you mouse over any part of the score, it has a window that shows you that same section of the score on the original pdf (very helpful!!).<br /><br />Overall, using this program is a much quicker and far less painstaking way of entering a score into Sibelius than entering it note by note directly into Sibelius. It will handle everything up to a large orchestral score. Although, the less clean the score is and the more complicated the notation is, the more mistakes it will make and the more time you will have to sort through its mistakes. No, it's not perfect. Yes it's helpful.<br /><br />By the way, it seems to be cheaper to buy this as a bundle with Sibelius software. I bought this bundled with a Sibelius 7 upgrade for less than the price of this by itself. This is designed for Sibelius users as it's shortcuts and way of editing notes is similar to how it's done in Sibelius, but is supposed to be able to export scores to Finale and other programs.
