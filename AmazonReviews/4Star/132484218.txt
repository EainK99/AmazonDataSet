To me it wasn't clear in the picture that the plastic plug ends are much larger that you typically find with headphones.  I bought this to fit in a waterproof case; in order to pass into the case, the plug can't be much larger that what you find with a pair of iphone headphones.  If that's not a issue for you, this is a good buy.
