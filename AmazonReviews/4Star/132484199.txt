Often ill take cool looking gift cards what not and punch them, and they look great. You can usually get 5 picks out of a credit card if you do it right, which is a great way to recycle those things. Just dont expect an individual pick to last you very long. Most of the plastics that credit cards/ gift cards are made out of are not very durable plastics (your strings will chew up the pointy end, and make it blunt and round), and if your playing a gig you may be tossing those things into the crowd like candy.
