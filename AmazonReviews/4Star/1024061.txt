The music stand is very attractive.  I am pleased with the finish and color.  It is taller than I expected, good for a vocalist or a musician who stands.  However, it cannot be lowered to a level comfortable for a performer who sits, like me.  I think the part that slides up or down can be sawed down to a manageable length, though.  Otherwise, I recommend it to others.
