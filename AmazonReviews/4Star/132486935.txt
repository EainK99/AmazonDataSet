So far so good. I haven't used it to play gigs yet but I have practiced with it and I am pleased with the sound so far. It doesn't come with real good instructions of how to get the best sounds so I'm still trying to figure it out. It's nice and compact & looks pretty cool. Cant wait to try it out with a live performance.
