I owned the SansAmp RBI for about 10 years before I sold it. I ran it thru the FX loop of an SWR SM-900 head to obtain that SVT tube-crunch. Of course, no solid-state pre-amp is going to crunch like a vintage Ampeg SVT.<br /><br />The presence knob is tuned at a higher frequency than the treble knob. I always kept the presence low cuz it was a little bright for my ears. I suppose it would come in handy if you had a muddy 15-inch cabinet.<br /><br />In theory, you want to keep the blend control up all the way to utilize the full capacity of the tube-emulation circuitry. But I honestly didn't like the way it sounded with the blend all the way up so I kept it about two-thirds of the way up to keep that \\"bass twang.\\"<br /><br />Outside of the gigs, I used it for home recording and headphone practice. The one time I plugged it into a Crown power amp and turned it into a bass rig, I was not too pleased at the tone I got out of my amp. Maybe I was partly spoiled by the warm sizzle of the SWR.<br /><br />The overdrive always sounded a little watered down to me. Maybe if it had a pre-amp tube, it would have given out a warmer tone.<br /><br />But if you do decide to use the RBI as an amp head (with an external power amp), it has it's own FX loop. It has a switch for \\"series\\" or \\"parallel\\" FX loop. What's confusing to me is: a parallel FX loop usually has a volume knob or blend control to mix the wet and dry signal. And the only wet and dry signal on this pre-amp is the tube-emulator tone vs. your dry bass tone.<br /><br />Overall, it came in handy and was a great buy for the money. I just wish it was a tube pre-amp. That's parly why I sold it.
