I needed a cab that wouldn't break my back, and the price was extremely reasonable. I saw some reviews that said the speaker was either too bright or too dark. I assume it would depend on the amp driving it. I am using a POD 2.0 into an ElectroHarmonix 22 Caliber power amp, and can pretty much get most any tone I need, at more than adequate volume. Time will tell how the thing holds up, but since I don't gig a lot, I think it should be good for years.
