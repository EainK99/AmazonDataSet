Ordered 2 ,wasn't expecting much from these .  right out of the box one work fine, the 2nd one sounded like there was a high pass filter on it very thin sound. Sent the broken one back and kept 1.<br />I compared it to the Behringer xm8500 .<br />This felt much lighter compared to the Behringer but sounded very close  when testing as a vocal mic .  They both have a good amount of handling noise. This mic is  very intelligible and that's all that I need from it .
