From the first usage this metronome has been more effective for me than any other.  It is amazing how feeling the beat changes things.  With aural or visual metronome the brain has to interpret the sound--this system removes that step.  You feel the beat.  It's a visceral reaction.  The functions are basic and enough for me.  The good side of that is the ease of setting and operating.  I would give it 5 stars, except that it is high maintenance.  The battery lasts for about 10 hours of pulsing--for me that is about a week of use.  At over $4 per battery (CR2032 3volt) retail, that comes to about $200 a year. The only competition in a pulsing metronome is the Body Beat which costs $100 more, but is rechargeable and can be used plugged in.  See the reviews of that product to read about the problems that nome has with recharging.  For the time being, the Homeland is doing so much for my playing I am willing to pay the price.  It takes a while to figure out where you are going to feel it best on your body.  I used a bicep band from the sporting good store for clipping it onto my arm or lower leg.  I would like the pulsation to be a bit stronger.  BTW, you will know you need a new battery when it just will not enter pulsating mode anymore.  It will still operate in sound and light modes.
