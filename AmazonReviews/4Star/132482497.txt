[[VIDEOID:moXDNH937MMARA]]Recording sample attached.  Meteor mic with a classical guitar. (song: pequeña serenata diurna by silvio rodriguez)<br /><br />I've been experimenting a bit with this mic, and after a couple of weeks I really like it.  I read many reviews complaining about it, and everyone compares it to the Blue Yeti.  I've never tried a Blue Yeti, and I bet it's great, but the Meteor Mic is a very very good recording microphone and it's relatively cheap.<br /><br />The good:<br />*great sound.  I tried it with my acoustic (classical) guitar, singing voice and narration voice.  It sounds great with all of them.  Picks up the nuances of my speaking voice, does not cut away the deep guitar notes, and even picks up the sliding fingers on the chords (though I wish I wouldn't make those noises)<br />*looks awesome<br />*tiny legs<br />*volume button<br />*mute button<br />*portable<br />*easy to use<br /><br />The so-so (tips):<br />all the advertising says it's plug in and use, and it's true, but if you want to get the most out of it you should download ASIO4ALL (windows).  Using ASIO4ALL gives you a way better sound than recording with the regular MME.  Also, watch out where you're recording.  You'll obviously pick up unwanted sound and echo if you are in a sub-optimal room.  I record in my closet where the clothes and rugs suck up all the sound and I get a very nice sound.  Before I picked this up I wasn't really happy with the sound I was getting because it was a little fishbowl-y.<br /><br />The bad:<br />the only thing I would complain about is the fact that with this microphone you're stuck with cardioid.  The Samson Go has three options--Omnidirectional, unidirectional, and close-up unidirectional.  Blue Snowballs and Blue Yetis also have these options.  If the Samson Meteor Mic really wants to compete with the Blue Microphones (in the same price range) it should really consider adding flexibility to this mic, especially if lower-end samson mics have this flexibility.<br />*missing on board gain control<br />*mute button makes thump when pressed, and this is captured by microphone.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />it's a great mic, it records well and it looks awesome.  Use ASIO4ALL not MME, and make sure you're in a good room to record.  It's not as flexible as i'd want it to be.  Being stuck with cardioid will probably limit its use for conversation style podcasting among several people using one microphone, but you might manage a two person conversation if you raise the levels enough (watch out for distortion and unwanted sound though).<br /><br />If you can get it for a sweet price it's totally worth it.
