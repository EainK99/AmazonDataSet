Funny how many people commented on how SMALL this thing is. Through seeing pictures of it, I knew it'd be small, but was still surprised at how tiny it really is. That said, size doesn't matter at all here, and the smaller/less obstrusive the better. The image photo makes it look like it'll be two or three inches across, when it's really an inch at best. Again, it works nicely, so not a problem.<br /><br />Unless....<br /><br />I have one guitar, an Epiphone acoustic; as with most acoustics, I've three tuning pegs on either side of the headstock. Placing the Wedgie holder in the middle (between the D and G strings), it moves around, staying stock still only when rested/placed against the nut--not the best for staying out of the way for first-fret notes. I've tried it between other strings (both from the same side), and it works better this way, but it's not centered. This isn't a huge deal, but I hang my guitar on the wall, and it gets in the way of the wall mount's arms when not centered. In fact, when it is centered, but not wedged against the nut, the held pics also get in the way of the arms.<br /><br />It does what it was designed to do very nicely, but it seems that it's really designed for guitars with all six strings' tuning pegs on the same side of the headstock, as on many electrics. I like that I can have two different-weight picks at my disposal at a quick reach, so I'll continue to use it, but it's just a bit fiddly on my acoustic. I've no worries that it'll fall off or anything, however.<br /><br />Great product, just bear in mind how it was designed. No other problems at all with it. Simple, effective, inexpensive, unobtrusive, and it doesn't affect tone or tuning at all. I give it 4 only because it's not 100% perfect for my application.
