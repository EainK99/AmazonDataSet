This is a great little drum. People who have played drums for years are surprised by this little baby. It is a ton of fun to play. Very crisp sounds, very nice finish. Well built at a very reasonable price. You can get a lot of sounds moving around the playing surface and even using the sides. Higher pitched than a traditional bongo, and that's where my only complaint comes in. I wish the low side was, well, lower. Not a lot of bass. However, the snares are easily removable, and I'm hoping removing the snare from the low end will clean up the bass sound. Overall, great drum and I'm glad I got it. A little more bass and it would be 5 stars all the way.
