So this thing is pretty cool for the money. The intensity stops short of really hard and choppy but still keeps a good effect. The best thing about it is the built in light that blinks with the speed chosen. The only down side is it works when the effect is on. They would have a winner if it was set up where a different color light was on when the effect was off to see the same thing and then switched to another as the effect was engaged. Overall it's a great purchase and would recommend if you are looking for a tremolo on the cheap that is built like a tank.
