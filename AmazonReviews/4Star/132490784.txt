It does what it needs to. The assembly is a little confusing at first, and there's not much documentation out there--it's one of those things you're expected to &#34;just know&#34;, I guess. It would be nice if the interior connectors were labelled, but not a big deal if your mixer manual has a nice picture like mine did.
