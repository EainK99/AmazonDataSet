I got this capo because I wanted to learn to play songs in my key, I was a little nervous at first because of the bad reviews, but since I'm learning, I figured it wouldn't hurt to get it. I've had the capo for about 2 months now and I love it!!! The only thing is, the guy at guitar center said it could cause the guitar to go sharp due to the amount of tension, (or something like that, I don't remember.....anyways....) I don't care, it works great at its doing its job! :)
