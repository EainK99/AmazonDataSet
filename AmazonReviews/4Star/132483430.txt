This pedal sound great! the only bad things i have to say are about the layout. The 9V DC jack is very close to the input, causing the 90 degree patch cable to sit at a funny angle. also i wish the LED was located somewhere other than right next to the switch. I have to move my foot away from the pedal to see whether or not it is on. Since some of the songs have fast toggling of the switch during a complicated guitar part, this is just another thing to have to think about.
