I'm using this to hold my mic up near my head level for when I do my gameplay commentaries, and it does the job. The only issues I have involve one of the balls at the end of the pin that tightens the arm falling off (glue did the trick there) and the arm will gradually lower itself if it isn't tight enough. Also, be wary if you have a heavier mic as it will cause the entire stand to tip if you don't have it aligned properly.<br /><br />These are all issues that can be worked around though so I can't complain too much, especially with the price.
