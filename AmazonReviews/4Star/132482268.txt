These are great for audio work or listening to music as it was meant to be without a lot of added bass.<br /><br />They are a little plasticy, and sometimes it takes me a minute to unfold them and get them squared away before I can put them on my head. They are comfortable, although I am usually only wearing them for a couple hours at a time.<br /><br />I use these and my Sony MDR-V6. It's a toss-up between the two. They are both great choices.
