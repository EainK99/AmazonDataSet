My guitar cases last for decades but I burn through handles regularly. The handle on my Alhambra classical case fell off after only one year! Using a rope tied to the connector wasn't cutting it so I looked far and wide for a handle and found the Grover on Amazon. Sadly, it didn't fit but works with my TKL, Takamine and SKB cases perfectly so not all is lost. The Grover will only replace another 5-inch handle. It flexes a wee bit but don't expect to stretch more than 1/4 inch or so.<br /><br />Installation took about 1 minute. If you can bucket your belt, you are already a master handle installer!<br /><br />I own an old Grover handle from the late 1980s. It's still going strong on an ancient Ramirez guitar case. It has thicker leather and a metal reinforcing strip backing the leather where it attaches to the guitar case. This newer design still uses quality leather but lacks the metal strip and probably won't last as long as the old handle. Oddly, the Grover packaging and graphics look like they were designed during the 1950s so that part hasn't changed. All in all a nice handle but at $20, a bit pricy. Just make sure a 5-inch handle will fit your case before ordering.
