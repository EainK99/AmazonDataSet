As other users mentioned, it is better to hot glue the strips in place instead of relying on the sticky back.  Also, there aren't very well written instructions for programming the remote for custom colors.  Overall, though, I am very pleased with these lights.  They can be cut every few inches as denoted by the cut icon on the strip.  I used these lights on the inside of a picture frame to change the colors of chalk drawings.  It provided a very neat effect to the drawings.
