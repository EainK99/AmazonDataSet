I bought this mute about six months ago and use it regularly. Everything works acceptably and stores easily when not in use. I use a K&M euphonium stand that stores the horn upright so I don't have to take the mute out when I'm not practicing. The electronic unit clips to a brace on the horn, which is convenient. I just put the horn with the silent brass mute in the stand and walk away. The Silent Brass system isn't perfect, but certainly acceptable considering that the alternative would be having to use a regular practice mute (I've had two Wick practice mutes in years past but was never really able to get used to them).<br /><br />There are some negatives, though. First, I have some trouble keeping a good connection with the earphone jack. If I stretch the wire any, the earphones cut out and I have to jiggle the plug to get them to work again. Also, the sound is not quite what I expected--it's a bit stuffy and 'electronic' (but definitely better than the sound I got from regular practice mutes). Also, the mute changes how the horn responds, so I'm limited as to what kind of practice I'm able to do.<br /><br />All things considered, though, I would certainly buy this product again.
