You can get all kinds of crazy tones with this thing. I bought it for the purpose of running a &#34;Power amp&#34; to a speaker cab. I would then require some kind of EQ. Turned out the power amp I got from guitar center was a DUD so I returned it for a Hartke LH500 and now I don't need this thing. =(
