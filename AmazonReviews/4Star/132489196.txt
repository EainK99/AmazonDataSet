my oldest daughter (12) is the oboe player in the family.  she is hard on reeds (she's learning), so she goes through them pretty fast.  she normally uses a medium reed, and i don't know if she goes through them so fast because she is hard on them from misuse, or, if the reeds are of so-so quality and they just can't take the abuse.  sound quaility for me is hard to judge because my daughter is in her second year of playing the oboe - so Kenny G she is not.  but working on it.<br /><br />i will give this 4 stars for now, because only time will tell.  i still feel these are WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for what you get.  I think i will research how to MAKE reeds because over time, that may be a better deal.  as soon as my daughter can give me feedback on THIS reed, i will let you know.
