Right out of the box I was extremely impressed by the build quality of the unit. When you pick it up for the first time you automatically feel like you own a high quality item.Set up was quick and easy - no issues at all. Took about 5 minutes to set everything up and install drivers. Right when i started playing music you can tell the quality is 10000x better. You do not need to train your ear for that &#34;slight difference&#34; in quality. Highly impressed thus far for the price (I purchased it for 149.99 @ local retailer) Now the only problem I have with this unit. The dials. They make the whole unit feel like something you bought from the dollar store. They actually feel like garbage. They feel loose and are hard to grip. I'd take down another star, but the build & sound quality are too good.
