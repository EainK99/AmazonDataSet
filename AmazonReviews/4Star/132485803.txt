Not bad at all!  Assembly was easy and all parts were accounted for.  I was a little crestfallen at the limited ability of the computer, only a dozen or so different settings, and the hi hat will cut out if you release the pedal after striking it with a stick.  The neatest feature in this drum set is the ability to record.  All you need is an SD card.
