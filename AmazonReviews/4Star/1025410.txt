Fantastic with purples, pinks, blues, greens, not so much with non-base shades or red, or yellow. Orange is merely a deep yellow. Definitely worth the price though and surprising range of hues aside from those gaps.<br /><br />Plastic box is fairly flimsy so I would secure with some putty or something. Also the box generates a decent amount of heat so careful of it overheating if putting it, say, under a pillow like I did at first.
