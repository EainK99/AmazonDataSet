Sweet, precise, proper.  Because I'm a perfectionist, I'm going over it and melting all the edges and corners, and I may mirror polish it, just because.  Mine came a little beat-up looking, not what I'd really call a &#34;nice brushed finish&#34;- lots of little scratches and dings from manufacturing or whatever, which is normal, but it'll look amazing polished, and I wish it was a bit smoother to start...  If you're going to work on your bass, or somebody else's, you probably need one of these.  Fair price for a quality tool, machined in the USA.  Beefy, looks like it'll last forever with reasonable care.  Four stars instead of five because I'm a finish and polish guy, and this was a bit rougher than nice, but that's a minor quibble.
