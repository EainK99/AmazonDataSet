Bought these a while back and love them. I've never owned a pair of &#34;studio&#34; quality cans and I didn't want to bother with the expensive beats by dre. Saw several reviews and these headphones do live up to their hype. A big step up from cheapy ear buds.<br /><br />Bass is deep, mids are good, and in general these cans just sound good. Only reason I give them 4 stars is because over time the weight of the coil cable actually bent the connector slightly. I have them hooked up to my PC in the front audio port which causes the cable to sag, putting stress on the connector. Didn't see this coming and it may not necessarily happen to you.<br /><br />You can get these retro fitted to have a detachable cable from the sound professionals and purchase a straight cable. That should be a good work around to the heavy coiled cable as well as the ability to switch out cables in case it gets damaged.
