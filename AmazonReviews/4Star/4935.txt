they do sound a little bit better than my amazon patch cables. they are tad clearer and the sound is a bit fuller and lush. as far as assembly goes thats why i gave it a 4. its was not hard but a pain in the butt. and for 100 dollars they should have given you 15 feet of cable. i had just!!! enough to wire my pedalboard. so the whole time i was worrying if i measure something off or white putting it together it doesn't work and i need to start again there is not enough cable to mess up. did i mess up no but having little to no room to mess up sucks and still wasn't enough cable to rout  some things around the edges to really hid things. 100 dollars idk should have given 15 feet minimum 4/5
