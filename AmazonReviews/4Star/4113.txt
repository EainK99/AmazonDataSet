At first, I was thrilled to get this tuner which they say (the manufacture) is the most sensitive clip on tuner available, at any price.<br /><br />I do like it, hence the 4 stars, but it does have some 'bugs' that can be annoying.<br /><br />For whatever reason, it doesn't like the guitar's, low E, bass string? It goes into it's multi-string mode and only turns to it's single string tuning indicator when I squeeze it while striking the low E string? The rest of the strings show up normally but the B string often flickers between indicating F# and B?<br /><br />BTW This isn't on just one guitar! I currently have 12 guitars and these failings are visible on all of them!<br /><br />I have not contacted the manufacturer, yet so, I can't say if they will help or not?<br /><br />I do like bonus computer tuning plugin that came on a small strip of paper, inside of the box! I almost missed it but it has a code that lets you download your free bonus ... a $50 software plugin that lets you tune your guitars when connected to your computer! It works perfectly!<br /><br />I've used the strobe mode, too.<br /><br />Overall I like it but I wish it didn't have this weirdness which I figure they will fix over time? Because of it, when I am rushed I still use my old faithful (but not as accurate?) Snark clip-on tuner.
