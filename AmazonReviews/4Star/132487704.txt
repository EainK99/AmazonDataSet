I teach a variety of classes at local fitness centers and in that not all of the venues have sound systems, and in addition the studio sound systems are often having technical issues, I always keep a back up.  I keep two fully charged at all times, as my voice is prone to strain and in that I have taught classes for over 30 years, I do not want vocal nodes.  The system works reasonably well and holds a charge for about 8 or more hours of class.  The second one I purchased had a nasty buzz when I received it, so I sent it back.  I am looking forward to having my backup system soon!  I have used it outside for conference gatherings, but the volume was not sufficient.  For Hydro-fit classes, it works well, however.  My guess is that I am at the poolside and sound travels well over the water.  The volume is also sufficient in the classroom setting where the acoustics may be enhanced by the \\"clam shell\\" effect.<br /><br />I would recommend this unit for a cheap solution to enhancing the voice.  The waist strap is extra long, so if you are small or medium in stature, you will need to adapt it.  I might also recommend simply keeping the headset permanently plugged into the unit to reduce the natural wear that this connection is prone to get.  That connection seems to have been the Achilles heel of the majority of systems I have been exposed to, and it is unnecessary to continually unplug it.
