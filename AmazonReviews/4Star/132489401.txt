Ordered the pickup after much research. Original seller was in Jacksonville. I received an email from them letting me know they were out of the pickup but had found a different seller in Massachusetts and that seller would be sending me the pickup. Sounds good, right? The pickup I needed was for my Fender American Special HSS stratocaster, which is why, when I ordered the pickup I made sure it was advertised as &#34;F-SPACING&#34; which is what fits Fender American made strats. The pickup I received was not F-spaced and was too small for the humbucker space in my American made strat. After doing some research online I found that regular spaced pickups are what are used in Fender Mexican made strats. I made the decision to put this pickup in my Mexican Strat and avoid the hassle of having to send it back and hope they have, and send the proper spaced pickup or chase a refund. The pickup fits and sounds great, 5 stars for the pickup, 4 stars for dumb luck that I was able to use it.
