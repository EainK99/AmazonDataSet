I have owned 2 pairs of Sennheiser headphones, and these have extremely good sound quality for how cheap they are. The HD 201's do not sound quite as good, but that's probably because they are $20.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Sound quality: Good level of highs, mids, and lows. Very deep bass and these actually drown out a lot of outside noise. I was surprised at how much noise they cancelled. Much better than the 201's.<br />Design: Made for mid to small ears. There's also a cushion at the top and the ears cushions are just enough padding. Sometimes I forget I have them on.<br />Price: Outstanding price for how good they sound. They aren't your Bose or Beats by Dre but what do you expect! Great for the price.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Chord length: WAY TOO LONG!! These must be made to watch TV because the chord is about 10 feet long and I didn't realize until I unwrapped the chord. I use them on the computer so I only need about 3 feet.<br />Comfort: After about an hour they start to hurt my ears, I don't know about anyone else but if I wear them for a long time I have to shift them around.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed at how good they sound and the noise cancellation is really good. It comes with a plastic device to wrap excess cable up. Good product Germany!
