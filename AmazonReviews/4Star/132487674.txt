Good strong case fits my 2012 squier vintage modified jaguar like a glove.  No movement in the body, holds the neck tightly even.<br />The looks on the outside are a little more industrial than I'd prefer but I but it could take more punishment than a more traditional looking fender case.  I would be pretty confident checking this on a flight.
