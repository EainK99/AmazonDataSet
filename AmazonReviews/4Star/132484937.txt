love being wireless. only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because think i notice a slight loss in clarity so may not be for the fussy. the difference is so small really that you would have to be pretty serious to be bothered by it. obviously i wouldn't use this to record with but when i'm jamming the freedom is fantastic for the price.
