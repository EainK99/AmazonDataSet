I use it as a concentrator of many optical sources (cable TV, DVD player, IPTV box) to output audio through an analog 5.1 amp.<br />It works fine, but lacks of an on/off switch and the stereo/surround selector has no light indicator, so you don't know which is the current selection except by hearing the resulting audio oputput.<br />Some reviewers say it is not a true 5.1 decoder, I can't properly say if it is true or not, but as I played stereo music and there is output by the surround speakers I can guess that is not a real 5.1 decoder.<br />It is nice for the money, but if you want a real 5.1 decoder then buy a 5.1 amp.
