This instrument cable strikes a good balance, value vs. cost.  While it does not have the heft of some of the more expensive cables, it provides performance that meets my need, at a price that is very reasonable.  The diameter of the cable is on the small side, yet the insulation covering compensates for this with a material that is harder, and in my estimation, a bit tougher, resisting cuts or abrasion.  It has a slight tendency to kink, and retain the kink if stepped on wrong.
