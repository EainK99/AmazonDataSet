This Sporran was much better looking than I expected. No, it is not a hand made from the Highlands; badger fur  culled in the wild crags of Loch Tummel and artistically fashioned in the centuries old tradition in Glenn Somewhere, etc, etc, etc...  You get my drift. Nice looking Sporran for most occasions. The rabbit fur is nice and the silver tassels look good. The metal used is nothing to write home about, but it looks good at first glance and I hope it holds up. The belt chain is serviceable but cheaply made. The leather is functional and has no obvious flaws.<br />Again, for the money, this Sporran is fantastic and looks great but is not of great quality. If you are on a budget this is a great looking Dress Sporran.  As for its durability, that remains to be seen. I will update this review as fair ware and tear occur and  inform you of any catastrophic failures.
