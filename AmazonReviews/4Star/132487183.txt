I have another one--same exact model that needs repair--so I bought this unit.  The vocal effects are good for the price.  Downside is that it's fragile.  Especially the big plastic knob on a plastic shaft on right side of unit.  It should really be in a rack mount, but the way I use it, in a live band for gigs, I don't know how you could make it work that way, even with a foot pedal, as you wouldn't be able to see the display unless you had the whole case elevated a foot from your head.  So, I've resigned to leaving it in it's original packing and carrying that box inside another case for transport.  A bit of a pain but pretty good effects.
