This case can fit a good number of pedals, and gives you two stick-on Velcro strips that you can glue your pedal to so you can adjust positions/order, and it also keeps pedals from floating around in the bag when being carried. It has a little room for a power supply under the board. The case comes with nice instructions on how to set up everything as well. The only drawbacks I could find were that the board is a little heavy (but then again, what board isn't?) and it has no shoulder straps. But it is so worth the money.
