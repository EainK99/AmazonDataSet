I bought the sax because my son joined band, but not knowing anything about the sax, I purchased it, received it in no time at all and my son is practicing daily with it. As far as his music teacher is concerned, it was a good buy, works perfectly and reasonable in price. If I needed another sax, I'd buy another like it, no doubt!
