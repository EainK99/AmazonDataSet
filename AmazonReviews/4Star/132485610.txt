Attach to thrones leg and done.  Not much to it, but it does it's job as a place to hold a foot in place. I notice my husband doesn't really use it much as he can rest his foot against any part of the thrones leg so although the product does exactly what it is suppose to... it just really isn't needed. For the price although, it's no biggie as at least it is there if he really ever wants to use it. Nothing wrong with product just not finding it needed or used. He may just not be using it much because he's not use to having one so maybe in time he'll find it useful.
