Purchased for my daughter's beginning piano lessons.  This has lots of nice extras like the light-up keys and &#34;lessons&#34; in which it teaches you to play various pre-programmed songs in small increments.  The keys on the first one I received from Amazon did not light up.  A poorly-designed instruction manual and an hour-long phone call to the very un-helpful Casio customer service center left me still wondering if maybe I was doing something wrong.  That call ended with a promise that another &#34;expert&#34; would call me within 24 hours--it's been over a month now, and still nothing. After 48 hrs, I decided that I couldn't be that terribly inept, so contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement right away.  The keys lit up immediately on turning it on.
