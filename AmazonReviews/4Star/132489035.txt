I had bought a learner's violin from another source before that did not really work. It could not tune properly at all.<br />But this one from The Instrument Store works well enough for practice, which meets my objective. Not the most brilliant sounding compared with expensive violins, but suits for practice.<br /><br />I recommend it for those looking for an economical, working instrument. The company also packs the instrument with care and delivers quickly enough. The only negative was the carry case it came with. One of the straps was breaking, and broke. But the case is still useable, can hand carry but not wear two straps.
