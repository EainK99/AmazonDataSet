After using these headphones for about 8 months, I've got this to say about them:<br />These are great headphones - definitely worth their price, they're dependable, they work great, and after 8 months, they still work like they did the first day.<br />Here's my pros and cons (Take note that I'm not an audiophile, so my views come from an average Joe who just happens to like music)<br />Pros:<br />DURABILITY - These things are far more durable than any of the other headphones I've used; by about this time, my other headphones would have broken, frayed, lost sound quality/noise cancellation, or bit the dust completely. At 8 months of near-constant use, the cord has some minor wear, but everything else is nearly pristine - and this comes from putting it in a backpack that gets thrown around on occasion - these things should be able to take some bumps and bruises and not be affected in functionality. Regarding the cord problem that people have (where the input doesn't seem to stay in the earphone jack), the cord actually has an end with a locking mechanism (It's the straight end jack, not the round-topped jack) that, when turned in the earphone, secures the cable in place, so there should be no issues with the cord coming out of the headphones.<br /><br />SOUND - Again, I'm just an average Joe when it comes to precise audio quality, but in terms of these headphones, from my stand point, they sound great. The bass is crisp, the mids and highs are sweet, and the quality is very good. These headphones can also handle pretty loud sounds well - though I try not to go too high, as to not damage my hearing - and for their price, they're some of the best I've experienced, sound-wise.<br /><br />FUNCTIONALITY - These headphones are easily portable, which is a huge plus for me, since I'm often on the go. You can coil the cord around the headphones in order to prevent the cord from going astray and tangling (more on that below). The earphone connectors are metal, which is also ahuge plus, because it's often the earphone connectors that are the first to go on cheap headphones, and the connectors have very good extension, allowing for more loose wearing if desired. And in all of the time I've owned these headphones, they have NEVER fallen from my head; the fit is snug, and you can really get into your music if you so desire, with the fitting of these bad-boys, you'd really have to try and shake these headphones off of your head (which is also somewhat of a con, see below). And if you happen to be a DJ, or musically inclined, you can flip and rotate the earphones to accommodate one-ear listening - it's a pretty nifty feature, though it can often jumble up the headphones for those who don't care for this feature.<br /><br />Cons:<br />COMFORT - This is perhaps the biggest drawback for these headphones, because, although they are snug, if you have an average-sized head or bigger, long-duration wearing of these headphones WILL HURT! After wearing these headphones for around an hour, you'll often have to remove them, set them down, and message your ears, because these headphones smash your ears in! It's a feeling you might get used to, but for me, this is something that really detracts from the quality of these headphones - I don't like having a lasting, headache-y feeling from listening to my music for longer than an hour, and this is the main reason I gave this product a 4 out of 5. Had the design been a tiny bit more flexible with the fitting, the pain wouldn't be an issue, and this product would be near-perfect.<br /><br />COMPONENTS - Mainly, the cord. Note that this product explicitly says *DJ* HEADPHONES, and with DJ headphones, you get a DJ headphone cord - however, for the mass majority of people who will never DJ or walk more than 10 feet from our Ipods or phones, this is a waste, and frankly, this is a big hassle. Most people, including myself, do not require 10 feet of cord in order to properly utilize these headphones. If you do notcoil the cord, you will often find it gets tangled or knotted, and when you want to listen to music on the go, you have to coil up the cord and stuff it into your pocket or purse - this really makes using your headphones in public a large nuisance. It would have been appreciated if the makers could have made a shorter, portable cord for those who don't desire 6 extra feet of unnecessary cord, but you could easily go and buy another cord should it bother you that much. Also, I figure the round ended headphone jack is meant for some sophisticated audio peripheries, however, for normal audio jacks, like ones on Ipods or cell phones, this jack will often detach if you bump it, due to how hefty and large it is - a minor qualm, but still, it's worth noting.<br /><br />That's all I got on these headphones, I still use them, and I still enjoy them for what they're worth, but I feel if there's another competitively priced pair that fixes the comfort and cord issues, that would be a better alternative to these.<br />I give these headphones 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />Matt R.
