Not the best stand in the world, but it's practical, doesn't take up too much space, it's comfortable to use, guitars have great support and has very good stability. I'm using it to hold an Ibanez AEG30E acoustic guitar, an Ibanez RG series electric guitar and a Session by Riverhead electric guitar and works perfectly good.
