I purchased this amp just because it had a built-in crossover. It powers 2 Crate 10's and 2 Sa-15ss subwoofers, which all are separtely daisy chained. The sound and power is just what I needed. Will be getting another one for the house. Use one channel for the ten's and the other one to run the subs. Awsome amp.
