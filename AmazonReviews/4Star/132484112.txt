Great deal for the price - but the \\"gig bag\\", strings, pick and \\"tuner\\" are worthless.<br /><br />1) Take the strings off and lower the \\"Action\\" immediately. The \\"Action\\" is the distance between the guitar strings and the frets below. This guitar's \\"Saddle\\" (the white bar the strings crest near the base of the guitar, like a \\"bridge\\" for a violin) was WAY too high. I took it off and shaved about half of it off the bottom, give or take.<br />BE CAREFUL when doing this, and probably go read or watch videos of how to do it first. The Saddle needs to have a flat bottom, be angled correctly for the strings (higher for low strings and lower for high strings) and be tall enough that none of the strings hit the frets when you pluck them.<br />2) Frame the giant, thick pick that came in the bundle and let your friends laugh at it. Purchase a pack of lightweight Dunlap picks. I bought a pack of 20 grey 0.6mm picks for $5 at Guitar Center.<br />3) Purchase new strings. The ones that came on this guitar were rusty and snapped almost immediately after being tuned. Another set came in the box with the guitar and appeared unused but I have no idea what quality or brand they are so I'm keep them as backup in case a string snaps during a show.<br />***Knowing how lightweight this guitar is, I didn't want to put too much strain on the neck so I purchased some Extra-Light Polyweb-coated \\"Elixer\\" strings. (you can get a set on Amazon for about $6)<br />4) Use a knife to fill the tuner\pitch pipe with peanut butter (being careful not to cut yourself) and stick it to your ceiling, holding it for an hour or so until the peanut butter dries and you can let go, leaving it permanently stuck.<br />***If you use this pitch pipe, you will likely tune an octave too high, putting too much strain on the strings and possibly bending the neck of the guitar causing permanent damage to the guitar's sound.<br />Instead, download one of these free Android\iPhone apps, \\"gStrings Chromatic Tuner\\" or \\"Waves\\". These are software tuners that use the phone's microphone to measure the frequency of sound to ACCURATELY tune your guitar. Guitar standard tuning defines the 6 string pitches as E, A, D, G, B, and E, from lowest (low E) to highest (high E).<br />5) With everything off your guitar, grab a phillips screwdriver and tighten the big screws that hold the tuning peg platform to the head of the guitar. Once finished, take the opportunity to clean your guitar, making sure to get the frets and tuning pegs to remove any oils, grit or dirt that could effect your play. This is a cheap guitar and the tuning pegs are neither sealed or covered, so they will get dirty, loose and need to be maintained.<br /><br />Now string your guitar and tune it, being careful to not over tighten any of the strings while doing so, and be patient. Once through all the strings, start back at the top and do it again - new strings will take several tunings over a period of at least a day or two before they are taught and can hold their tone.<br />If you find the action too high near the nut of the guitar (the big bridge between the head and neck of the guitar) you may need to take your strings off and shave down into the nut's grooves, but be VERY CAREFUL as you were with the Saddle.<br />Keep your guitar and strings in a cool, dry place.<br /><br />All done - I have a GREAT sounding guitar for $40 ($29.95 + $5.48 set of strings and a pack of 20 picks for $5).s\\".
