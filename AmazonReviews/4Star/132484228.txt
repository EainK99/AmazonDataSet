Not high quality but excellent product for just goofing around.  It fits easily on the violin and does amplify it.  My 8 yr old daughter wanted to switch from violin to electric guitar so we thought we would see what she thought of the &#34;electric violin&#34;. For a small amount of money, she was able to try it out and liked it but it didn't keep her interested.  No fault of the product, though.
