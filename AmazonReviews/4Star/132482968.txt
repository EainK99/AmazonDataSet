I took one star off because of the size.  You can get thin PAR 64 cans that are the same brightness.  It was like they took a old par can housing and added the led board.<br /><br />But, for $79 it is so bright.  It will fill entire 30x16 room with just one light.  The pasterns are so cool as it changes color.<br /><br />As, up lighting it will reach about 10-12 feet before the color begins to disburse with room lights on, but a clear color image can be seen on a ceiling.<br /><br />Negatives. Size about 1.5 basketballs. This will hurt mobile DJs.  No volume control on sound active mode.  Permanent power cable, and its shape makes it hard to use for up-lighting.<br /><br />I don't know if you will get the same seller as I did but, they will work hard to make things right if you have issues, and they are great communicators (I have had issues with Chinese based electronic sellers before, returns are such a hassle, and I was worried with this but for the price I took a chance, and when I had a issue with my order they worked all they could to get it fixed.)<br /><br />I hope this helps,<br />Practice, Preform, and Party!
