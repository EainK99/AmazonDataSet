I have the R6 with shelf and I think its a great cart. I am a service tech so I use it primarily to haul tools and a ladder around which saves trips back and forth to work truck I rigged up a crate which hangs off a pre drilled hole on top of front rail to transport smaller items. It sets up in less than 5 minutes the shelf is a pain at times to set up for one person also the front wheels dont clear obstructions that well like when going through exterior commercial doors. For the use I get out of it it's ideal not super heavy duty which keeps the weight down. I would recommend this product front wheels could be improved though 4 out of 5 Stars.
