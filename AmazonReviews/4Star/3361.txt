I have been playing guitar off and on for almost 30 years, and about 8 years ago, I was down to one electric and wanted an acoustic.  I found this guitar for my son - liked it and then purchased one for myself.  Since then, I have changed out the tuners for Grover Rotomatics and installed my own undersaddle pickup system. I have went to brass bridgepins, and a more decorative pickguard.  The guitar continues to stay together well, as well as play on and on.  Its got a great feel to the neck and has excellent sound acoustically or amplified.  Yes, I did quite a bit of customization to the guitar - the point is the &#34;Base Unit&#34; is bopping along nicely.  I believe that &#34;out of the box&#34; this is an excellent beginner or &#34;retread&#34; guitar player's guitar.  If same beginner or retread knows someone who does &#34;modifications&#34; such as I did - it can grow with them.
