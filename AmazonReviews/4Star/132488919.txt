This stand is very sturdy once you figure out have to get the pieces together.  It should totally be more intuitive than it is and doesn't come with even basic instructions (which would have saved time for sure).  However, once I figured it out, it has worked well for our son and sits square on the floor and is sturdy construction.  My only caveat would be the assembly issues; otherwise, its a good purchase at a reasonable cost.
