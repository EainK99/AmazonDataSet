These do not fit DiMarzio Humbucker pickups.  They came quickly, as promised in perfect condition.  I am wondering if they are F spaced but something I learned is that DiMarzios are spaced a little tighter than other brands.  Anyway,  I will keep them for that random project or friend that might need them.
