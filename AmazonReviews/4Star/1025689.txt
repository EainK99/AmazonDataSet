Had to do a little filing to get the right height I wanted on my Fender T-Bucket 300.  Really brightened up my sound.  It was a maple guitar so it was already pretty bright to begin with.  Helped with the intonation and resonance, but ended up being a little TOO bright for my liking.  If you have a mahogany or rosewood body with a spruce or cedar top, maybe give this a shot.  Maple back, sides and top were too much with this.
