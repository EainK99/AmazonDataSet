All shipped in one box, but each item in individual packaging. Keyboard works fine; headphones, power supply and USB cable all adequate. Did not come with screws for keyboard stand.<br /><br />EDIT: The keyboard stand appears that it was repackaged in it's box as a used item but given as if it were a new item; half the leg stand parts are in a bag, half are not. Frame appears to have some superficial damage and scratches at the center where it pivots.
