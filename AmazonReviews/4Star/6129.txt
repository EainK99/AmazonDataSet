First off PLEASE take note that the SHIPPING weight for this on Amazon is inaccurate, this is NOT 30 pounds, it is almost 75 pounds!!<br />Here is the UPS weight when it was shipped: Shipped/Billed On:08/20/2015Type:PackageWeight:72.80 lbs<br /><br />So make sure you are there when it arrives so you can have them carry it INSIDE the house. I came home late that night and it had been left on our porch and we had a torrential cloudburst, thank goodness the wind had been blowing away from the porch as most times it blows into the porch and the box would have been soaked and or falling apart. I don't know how I would have dragged it inside if it had been soaked!<br /><br />When I compared this one to the Casio PX750 model I was torn on which one would be best for my daughter as this one does not have the pedals and the 750 (at the same price) does!  So even though I wanted to surprise her with this we asked her which one she wanted and she opted for this one, she didn't want the pedals and she liked that this one looked sleeker, more contemporary, not like an old fashioned piano or organ.<br /><br />It took two people over an hour to get this put together, the legs are not as sturdy as I would like but then again it is not meant to be leaned on so it should be fine. I took off a star for that as it really should be a bit sturdier IMO...<br /><br />I have owned both an upright piano and an electric keyboard in the past (VERY past about 20 years ago!) and this is definitely more like a real piano (sans the foot pedals). The most noticeable aspect to me was the keys action felt very natural as they would when playing a real piano, they really do feel heavier at the lower register and higher at the top! but this goes far beyond ANY piano with over 500 (550 I think) options for a variety of instruments sounds from synths,drums etc to strings! it is so so much fun!<br />It has an intuitive menu and you can select tone, rhythm and it even has a mixer!<br />Then when you are ready you can use the 17-track MIDI recorder, and the USB audio recorder and have it online in a flash!<br />She really likes it a lot.<br />So now she says to me, &#34;where's the matching bench&#34;.....?<br />No problem you can get one here, search Amazon for Casio CB7 BK Piano Bench.<br />Or you can get a wooden one like this: Yamaha BB1 Padded Wooden Piano Bench for about the same price.<br />You will definitely want a bench! Both of those are not adjustable though, I also saw this one for about $30: Yamaha PKBB1 It is an &#34;Adjustable Padded Keyboard Bench&#34; so be sure to order one when you get the keyboard, you will be glad you did, our computer chair just didn't look right with the sleek pretty piano!ady you can use the 17-track MIDI recorder, and the USB audio recorder and have it online in a flash!<br />She really likes it a lot.<br />So now she says to me, &#34;where's the matching bench&#34;.....?<br />No problem you can get one here, search Amazon for Casio CB7 BK Piano Bench.<br />Or you can get a wooden one like this: Yamaha BB1 Padded Wooden Piano Bench for about the same price.<br />You will definitely want a bench!
