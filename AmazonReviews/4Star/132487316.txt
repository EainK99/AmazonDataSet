Short history about me:(I have been doing both live sound and recording for over 20 years.  I have played trombone in band, brass quintets, orchestras, and jazz bands.)<br />About the Head Phones:  I started by allowing them to have a burn in period for about 48 hours.  About half that time was music and the other half was pink noise.  I found that like with most over the ear head phones that they are fairly good at blocking out back ground noise. I must say I was happy with the over all frequency response of the head phones after the burn in period. They have a smooth response going from one driver to the other in these units(lows to mids to highs).  To be honest my hearing only goes up to around 15kHz now a days, so I had a few friends try out the head phones and get back with me with what they though. (the group consisted of guitar players, singers, bass players, DJs, gamers, and some who just like listening to music)  I only asked they use lossless or raw audio files when listening.  Over all most liked the headphones and were impressed with the frequency range.  For the price these are good head phones.  Are there ones out there that sound better, yes.  I have personally used other models before that have a better sound stage and more open highs.<br />Recommend use:  General listening; Tracking; and Live sound reinforcement, I would use a set with a better sound stage and more open highs to do post production. As I writing this review I am listening to them now, over all I am happy with them.<br />I would and have recommended them to a friend.
