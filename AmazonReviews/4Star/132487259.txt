This case was purchased to be a lighter alternative to the extremely cumbersome hard case issued by a school for a school owned sax.  It is a great case and made the instrument light enough for an 11 year old beginning sax player want to keep taking lessons.  It has all that we need.  The only thing that is not very effective is the holding slot for the mouth peice.  If you buy this, make sure your musician puts the mouth peice in one of the zippered pockets rather than in the velcro secured slots.  It will simply slid out in transit and get lost as my daughters did.  Thankfully mouthpeices can be easily ordered and replaced through...you guessed it...Amazon.com!
