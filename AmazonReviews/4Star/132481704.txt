I like the mic. The sound quality is FAR beyond what you'll get with your built in mic on your macbook. I was thinking about doing the SnoBall, but decided on the Yeti instead because it was a little nicer and just a little more. It's sturdy, but I sometimes want to take it with me to shoot video for clients and it's not the most portable thing ever. To be honest, if I could do it again I might go with the SnoBall because I'm probably only really going to use the one side of the mic (I'm not going to be doing radio interviews with someone across the mic from me.) Anyway, just a thought.
