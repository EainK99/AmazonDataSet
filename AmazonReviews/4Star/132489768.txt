My technique may be unusual. I use one Alaska Pik on my index finger with my thumb and index finger in a position like I was gripping a flat pick. To strum I release the grip and use only my index finger to strum the strings without moving my elbow or wrist. The Alaska Pik works perfect for me.<br /><br />They also work well for traditional fingerstyle playing.
