Bought it to replace strings for my Taylor.<br />Does all the job that I need it to perform.<br /><br />Winds the strings fast<br />Pulls the pegs smoothly<br />cuts the excess wire<br /><br />DOES NOT SCRATCH MY GUITAR!!!<br /><br />the only issue really is that it squeaks a lot. can be fixed with some oil.
