I just want to say, these are some of the best ukuleles I have played. They are extremely well built, the sound and feel are amazing, and most of the ones I played had good intonation, which is rare even for the very high end brands.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy one of these.. I have not been able to put it down all day, I'm in love!<br />Just an amazed happy customer.
