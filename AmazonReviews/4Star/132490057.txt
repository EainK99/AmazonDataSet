'I normally use Aquila strings (or D'Addario's equivalent under their own brand).  Based on my past experience with Aquila strings, they are very powerful, and in some rare cases, may \\"overdrive\\" some ukuleles, producing unpleasant harmonic overtones.  The instrument for which I purchased these strings was one such instrument.  The two black trebles sound nice, and produce a pleasant tone.  They can be heard individually when strummed.  The 4th string, tuned to\\"D\\", seems a little louder than I would like for a truly balanced effect, but the tone is very nice.  From my perspective , black string sets by D'Addario are great alternatives for soprano and pineapple ukuleles, but for baritone ukuleles, for which D'Addario makes no black string Hawaiian set, this set is a real winner.
