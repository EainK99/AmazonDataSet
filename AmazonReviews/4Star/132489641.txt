I have been researching Chorus Pedals for Bass for quite some time...While many other companies offer the complex styles of chorus modulation and your abilities to alter the sound the pedal creates it all seemed laborious for a bass player...I mean Kurt Cobain used the simplicity of the EHX Chorus so take that into consideration for a moment. After many YouTube demos i decided to go with the EHX for the bass...I didnt want an overpowering chorus sound for the mix, nor did i require the multiple abilities to alter the sound. I now view this as an essential pedal for my board. Its one knob and depth switch keep the sound interesting to a crowd but it doesnt take the attention off of the entire band or the beautiful music we are all creating, but when the bass solo appears the crowds are in awe of the sounds that can be produced. Its a little bigger than your average EHX stompbox and the 1/8&#34; power jack is confusing why EHX would continue with, but if youve purchased a powered pedal board you should get a minimum of 2 1/8&#34; jacks (such as the SKB line) if not the visual sound package for 9v has three for you. I would have prefered the vintage, but found the reissue simpler to get immediately. The only negative i have noticed is that although it does not take away from the dry signal I have noticed that it does drop my gain very slightly. As for the pop/click when activating the pedal, just stomp down a tad harder...i have tested it multiple times and when i lightly activate it pops but when i put my big boy pants on, get into a gnarly bass solo and stomp that box...no pop!<br /><br />My guitarist (both of them) are jealous and are now planning to purchase the EHX Small Clone after playing through my board and they have TCE Corona and the MXR M234...<br /><br />If you want a simply constructed pedal with dynamic sounds the EHX Small Clone is just what your looking for. I play a Passive bass and this pedal produces beautiful sounds. I have it towards the end of mychain just before my Delay.<br /><br />Keep making them EHX, ill keep buying them.
