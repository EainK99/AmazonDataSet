Does the job. Added this connector to an XLR wall plate for use with a digital snake. Good quality connector, punchdown in the back is good, but can't give it 5 stars: the eject button (labeled 'push') at the top of the connector lost it's springiness right away and the fit for my ethercon cables is *extremely* snug.
