Love the hardware and what it does, but the software is too hard to configure/learn.  It took me 4 days researching on how to make this thing work using Sonar X2 (probably not a good combination especially if you're a beginner;  use Ableton instead, lol).<br /><br />MPK Mini Editor - i still haven't wrapped my head around this thing but i get annoyed every time i open it.  It's not user-friendly and  it's a bit complex to set up - the info on the web is quite limited too.<br /><br />MPC Essentials - not bad, but will require some research/YouTube tutorials to configure.<br /><br />Hybrid - THIS ONE MAKES IT ALL WORTH IT. I love it!<br /><br />Wobble - Haven't installed it yet.  I think Hybrid's enough.
