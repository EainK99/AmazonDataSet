I bought this as a deal when I bought a keyboard and a bench. the keyboard I got didn't say anything about a pedal in the description but it actually came with a really crappy and cheaply made pedal that doesn't work great. this one looks a lot nicer and a lot more sturdy, i'll be trying it out soon and getting rid of the crappy plastic one. it came right on time and very well packaged.
