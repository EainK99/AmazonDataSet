We have several First Act musical instruments in our house and they hold up well and are great quality and fun! This drum set is no different. It is a great set for the young music lover. Right from the start I was happy with the way it was packaged. Each drum was packed individually and nicely protected in the box. The drums seem to be of high quality and are nicely made.<br /><br />There is a lot to assemble. It is not difficult, but will take some time. I suggest assembling out of range of an anxious child waiting to start banging away.<br /><br />The drums even have tuners. I don't know that my five year old cars about tuning the drums, but for those taking lessons or more serious that is a great feature. That is where the stickers come into play, but I would expect most youngster to prefer having the stickers off to keep the drums cooler looking.<br /><br />The design is nice too. More masculine, but I imagine a girl would be happy with it too. It is a lot of fun.<br /><br />This is definitely a great drum set for the young musician.<br /><br />Update: after using these drums for a while we notice the connector parts were lose. You have to take apart the drum and tighten them from the inside. Annoying, but an easy fix.
