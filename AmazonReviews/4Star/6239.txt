I hear a lot of folks that say they bought this mixer and say they had problems with the headphone volume. I don't understand all that. It hurt my ears to turn it past 6. Sure beats the way my S2 is with headphone volume.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the USB sound quality is not really top knotch, but with all those options, basically 3 other options: the two lines/phone, aux, and heck, the mic input, you have plenty of choices to hook stuff up into this thing. I can easily see how this would be good for the 'non-laptop' DJs. My CD players sounded amazing with this thing. And the pans underneath the Low EQ was not an issue at all. Those pan faders are tight.<br /><br />The FX are sub par, but who cares, I'd rather use my own processor anyway. For price it gets the job done for me.<br /><br />Too bad behringer had such a bad rep going into this cause it's an ok little mixer.
