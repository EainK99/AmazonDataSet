This is a lower end bag, without heavy padding, but it's still very sturdy and provides good protection.  If I had a $4000 bass, I'd definitely spring for a better bag.  But for a student bass, this is perfect.  Unless you get really rough with it, it will do fine.<br /><br />It's well sized.  My 3/4 is on the larger side and fits easily into the bag. The zippers all work well.  The seams are tight.  It doesn't look or feel like it's about to fall apart.  It's worth what I paid.<br /><br />My only concern is whether it offers enough insulation for carrying the instrument in the winter.
