Bought this when my son was 4 months old. While he will look at these noise makers when I shake them, he has no interest in them on his own (he is now almost 7 months old). I do wish the rain maker was longer, it seems entirely too short. Perhaps this is a toy he will &#34;grow&#34; in to as he gets older.
