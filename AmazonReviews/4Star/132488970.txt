I am very happy with these.  My SCL2 series cord actually cracked and I sent them in to get serviced.  Long story short, I received these pairs from Shure.  I am so happy with these.  The buds that come with these are much better than the ones with the SCL2.  I am using the expanding foam ones.  The first time I used them, they expanded and blocked out the noise.  What this meant was much better Bass and clarity.  I am a drummer, so using these was incredible.  The sound is really clear.  As I drum, I hear minimal sounds from the kit and more from the monitors.<br /><br />I recommend these for musicians.  One reviewer said that it was a bad thing that they isolated the sound around you.  That means they are doing their job.  If you want earphones that bleed the outside noise, then, buy cheaper models, or use the buds that don't use the expansion foam.<br /><br />I would've given these 5 stars, but the only thing I am skeptical with is that the cord close to the ear buds are very stiff and you have to bend them to conform around your ear and back of your head.  I just think that eventually, these too will begin to crack, but we'll see.  Maybe that is why they designed them to bend is so that it protects it from cracking.  But, that will be determined in the future.<br /><br />I recommend these monitors for musicians and as a drummer, I can tell you, these work very, very well.  Recording or live performances.  I use them in both scenarios and they work incredible.
