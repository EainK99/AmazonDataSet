This product is a great alternative to the more expensive \\"Cab Grabber\\" type products, but if you are a North America user you need to know that this product comes with a European threaded gooseneck. This means you can't take a regular 5/8\\" mic holder and screw it on, you need to have an adapter like this one: [[ASIN:B0007Y60HG On Stage MA100 3/8-Inch Male to 5/8-Inch Female Mic Screw Adapter]]<br /><br />There is one of those adapters already in the \\"grabber\\" part of the unit that the gooseneck screws into, and it doesn't seem possible to remove it (I tried a big screwdriver as well as a coin, it seems like they secured it with locktite), so fitting your own 5/8\\" gooseneck doesn't seem possible.<br /><br />As long as you order the adapter along with this you should be good to go (or if you're buying a mic to go with it, get one that comes with a European holder like this (the LCE version): [[ASIN:B000CZ0R3S Shure SM57 Microphone]]<br /><br />Otherwise, great product. I was already using the regular Cab Grabber, but I had to buy a gooseneck with it to get an SM-57 properly positioned. Getting one of these Adam Hall versions with the gooseneck included for less money seems like a no-brainer, as long as you can get your mic attached :-)<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.
