This thing is a beast. I used to have CDJ 800s in the past and these are far better in every way.  The link, traffic light, record box, and hooking up USB stick is fantastic. They are great players, but before you purchase a pair of these, think about getting the 900s or 850s. About half of the clubs I spin at are still using 1000MKIIIs or 900s.
