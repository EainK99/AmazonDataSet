This stand does a good job, but might be a little too light in weight.  Something heavier would do a better job of holding the drum still.  The drum also will have a tendency to migrate to straight vertical, whereas the ideal playing position is angled away from you.  Since this stand has no clamping or attaching mechanisms, there isn't really any way to prevent this.
