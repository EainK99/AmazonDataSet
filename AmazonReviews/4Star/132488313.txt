I needed to replace an older case for a student alto sax and chose this one from Amazon. It's strong ABS plastic, and the price was right. It's well-padded on the inside, and the hardware doesn't seem flimsy nor prone to easily breaking. Note: this case does not fit every alto sax out there. I have a Yamaha YAS-23 (popular student model) which it barely closes and latches on, but also an older Conn model which will not fit in the padded cut-outs at all. I guess i expected there to be a bit more room on the inside to accommodate a larger range of alto sax models.
