This is a pretty basic controller and it good for first time users. The loop pads are easy to use however the sounds sample pads are a little harder to figure out with and their no directions. While I'm sure Numark tried to keep the costs down, this unit could use a double set of input and out put jacks as there is no way to record from it. Also could use LXR jacks. One pet peeve, the headphone and mic jacks are located on the site instead of back to the user. Not sure why but this location is odd. Otherwise good easy to use unit.
