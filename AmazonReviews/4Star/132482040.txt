I picked up this thing as an interim device until I decide on the mic pre and a USB interface.  For what it is, it works fine for me although I agree it produces a lot of hissssss. Even so, it allows me to use my Electro-Voice RE20 and it will likely end up in my drawer of unused gear once I move up in equipment.
