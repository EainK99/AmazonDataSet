These are good headphones. They are lightweight and don't give me a prolapse ear after prolonged use. The sound quality is surprisingly good for a bluetooth headphone, and the batteries last for a good while. I'd like to say two hours of continuous use<br />A few flaws I noticed:<br />- No battery indicator. The led light will flash red around 10 to 20%.<br />- When the battery is low the soud quality will go down dramatically.<br />- The controls are rather annoying when running, they tug and make significant noise when the flop around. This is easily fixed by using the clip provided.<br />Other than that, these are great headphones. Definitely worth a purchase if you are planning to use them for light work outs/cleaning duties.
