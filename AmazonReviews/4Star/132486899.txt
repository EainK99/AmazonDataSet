If you like cheap lighting effects this one is for you. We are using it in out TV studio to shoot bright green and red explod-y things all over the drums and cymbals during our drummers solo, it's a great effect. We're not able to use fog (legal reasons) so it's nice to find little lights like this that are bright.<br /><br />Don't expect a lot and you'll be happy with it. The manual cautions you not to run it too long or to turn it on and off too much.<br /><br />It's a fun cheap lighting effect, I'm happy with it.
