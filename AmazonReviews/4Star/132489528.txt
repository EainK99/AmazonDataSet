If you have no idea what I mean:<br /><br />If your sound system does not have a subwoofer and you have it at max volume, this thing works great!<br />If your sound system has a 4x10 bass cabinet acting as a subwoofer (or anything equally as destructive in terms of bass), the LEDs will not really work to the music since the controller's internal microphone cuts off at a higher frequency. It sort of shuts off if it detects very low frequencies. (i.e. the LEDs have trouble going with the music if you're blasting the sound system with high levels of bass)<br />Sort of blows in that respect....but otherwise great for lower volume levels.
