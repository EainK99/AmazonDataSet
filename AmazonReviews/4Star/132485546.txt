I bought this case for my C&oacute;rdoba C5-CE, because the factory-supplied gig bag started falling apart after one trip outside the house.<br /><br />The fit around the perimeter of the guitar is excellent.  It's very snug and secure, and there is just enough room for the electronics to squeeze in.  The fit at the front is tight enough to leave string impressions in the lining on the lid of the case.  The fit at the back is just a touch loose with this guitar.  I don't think it's loose enough to matter, but I wouldn't want to use this case with a guitar that was any thinner bodied than this one.<br /><br />The compartment under the neck rest is typical for a guitar case in that it isn't big enough to hold much more than a few packs of spare strings, a string winder, some picks and so on.  Since this is a classical guitar case, it would be awesome if it had a compartment somewhere big enough to store a foot rest, and that is the one big thing I will miss about the gig bag.<br /><br />The case came packaged in a flimsy piece of black fabric by way of shipping materials.  I can't remember the name of the fabric, but it's the kind of stuff they staple under boxed springs.  It's kind of thin and gauzy, and tears easily.  I think that fabric was basically just there to protect the brass tone hardware, and provide a place to stick the shipping labels and so forth.  I'm amused that they shipped the case in what amounts to a wisp of nothing, and it survived all the abuse between here and China completely unscathed.  I think that says a lot about how this case is going to hold up, and I think I made a good investment.<br /><br />I'd love it if it had more storage room.  It's a minor quibble, and I'd give it 4.5 stars if that were possible.
