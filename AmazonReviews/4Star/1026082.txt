For the price of this guitar its fantastic. The sound is warm, the strings have a nice feel to them, and the built in tuner is accurate. The case it came with is perfect. Only 2 complaints about the product. 1. They placed a sticker on the pick-guard that was tough for me to remove, and 2. There is some slight buzzing and rattling around the 12th and 13th fret on the low E string. However; for the price the guitar is fantastic.
