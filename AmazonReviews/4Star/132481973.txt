I am pleased with this microphone. I am not an audiophile or a profesional videographer. I wanted a microphone to extend the range of the audio pickup distance over the range of the built in microphone in my Panasonic HDC-TM900 camcorder. In my test it did add a significant distance to what I was able to record.
