Came with 24 mediums, 12 lights and 12 heavys just as advertised but the weren't color coded so you have red that are light and medium and others.  Not a big deal but it helps when grabbing for a pick of different thickness quickly between songs.<br /><br />Other than that minor thing, no major complaints.
