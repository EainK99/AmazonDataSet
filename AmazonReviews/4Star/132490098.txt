I decided to replace as many lights in my home with these as possible.  But before I did that I decided to get a benchmark on my kWh consumption if I had all of my lights on in my house:<br /><br />-with all lights on and no extra appliances running, one turn of the wheel on my meter took approx 16s<br />-with all lights replaced by these LED bulbs (6W, 380 lumen), one turn took approx 36s<br /><br />That equates to more than one half the power consumption by comparison!<br /><br />Very happy with my purchase.
