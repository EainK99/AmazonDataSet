I bought this product used thinking it was a Voodoo Labs and I got a great deal.  Later, when I read more closely and realized its a total knockoff, I was disappointed I hadn't gotten the killer deal I thought initially, but I was pleased to see this unit works very well so far powering a few pedals at once.<br /><br />My 2 main complaints are the purposely misleading name, and the shorter than necessary power cord.  This thing absolutely requires an extension cord, even just hanging out around the house.  Aside from that this thing sounds much quieter so far than my 1spot adapter, and it doesnt have a daisychain of unused cables that short out against metal like the 1spot did.
