A semi-faithful reproduction of the famed 1960/1982 cabinets of the late '60s, as used by the biggest acts in Rock which included Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />The Good:  They look great and, from the outside, you could hardly tell it wasn't an actual late '60s cabinet. All birch plywood in these, including the back panel. NO particle board or MDF anywhere. Fit and finish, for the most part, is quite good with properly done corner work. The handles are metal and look just like the originals except they have 8 screws instead of the traditional 6, which is probably better, but it looks different.  Includes some of the best sounding speakers available, the Celestion Heritage G12H. This will give you the classic late '60s sound that so many of us desire.  Rich, full sound that you can ONLY get from a 4x12 cabinet.  Perhaps a bit too bright sounding at first, but projects very well and not too directional.<br /><br />The Bad:  The basktweave grillcoth looks authentic, however, it could be installed a little more square. Looks a little misaligned and sloppy, although not terrible. Once you open the back panel, you can see that these cabinets are not built exactly like the originals. In fact, they're just like the standard production 1960 cabinets.  Marshall could have gone through greater lengths to build them authentically because, as many of us know, every little change in construction will alter the sound away from the originals.  The speaker wiring looks a little thin; they should have used a heavier gauge. The casters (wheels) are the screw-on type, which is fine, but the mounting plates are made of plastic, which means they may crack or strip out before too long if you're using this cabinet on the road.  Better to replace those with some heavy duty ones right from the start.<br /><br />The Ugly:  Even though many retailers are still displaying it in their stock photographs, the not-so-brilliant minds back at Marshall in the UK decided NOT to install the '100' logo in the upper left-hand corner of the grill cloth on these any longer. That was a signature part of the original cabinets and something everyone loves to see, but they did away with them claiming \\"the company that supplied the 100 watt logo can know longer manufacture the part anymore.\\" I believe this to be false because there are some parts suppliers still stocking these '100' logos, so I have no clue what that's all about, aside from yet another cost-cutting measure.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  These cabinets are good, but not great. They look authentic from the outside (minus the '100' logo), not so much from the inside, but they are made totally of birch plywood and do come with Celestion Heritage G12H speakers, which means they will sound quite good once they're fully broken in. You will, however, pay top dollar for it and could probably do much better in the boutique market.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I've just found out recently that Marshall is FINALLY once again installing the '100' logos in the upper left-hand corner of the grill cloth as of November/December of 2013.  From here on out, your cabinet should have these installed and I wanted to be sure to include this in my review just in case this was a deal breaker for anyone.o install the '100' logo in the upper left-hand corner of the grill cloth on these any longer.
