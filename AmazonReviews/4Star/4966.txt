Sound is excellent! And they are so comfortable. Upgraded from Sennheiser HD439's and never looked back. These are comfier and sound much much better with more detail and clear bass. I listened to favorite songs and discovered new instruments/sounds that I had never heard before.<br /><br />CONS: cable is too long. 5 stars otherwise
