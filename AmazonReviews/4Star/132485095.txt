Great keyboard for the money. My 10 year old son just started piano lessons. We needed a piano for him to practice on so this was a perfect option for us. The sound is great! He was so excited when it came in the mail yesterday.<br />The only problem we encountered was the stand didn't include any screws. The power supply worked fine. The headphones worked great too!
