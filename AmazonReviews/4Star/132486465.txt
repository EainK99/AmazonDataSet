We bought this unit for large outdoor party. It was easy to charge, easy to move around. Battery lasted the full five hours it said it would. That was with it turned up pretty loud. Wireless mic worked well too. When using an iPod make sure the volume is turned up on the iPod. Then turn up the speaker itself. If not, sound will be distorted. Sound was clear after figuring that out.
