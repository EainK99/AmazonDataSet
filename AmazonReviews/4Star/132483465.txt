This is a beautiful guitar with the kind of craftsmanship I would expect from Epiphone. The only complaint is that the strings needed to be changed. And it still has a bit of an annoying kind of buzz from some of the strings. Over all it's a very nice guitar for the money and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice acoustic without the high price.
