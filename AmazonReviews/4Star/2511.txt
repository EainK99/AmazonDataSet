I ordered the 1/2 sized violin for my child.  I am a violinist so I tuned it and played a bit.  On the instrument we received, the bridge wasn't shaped correctly.  It was hard to play the D string without hitting the G string as well.  Took it into the local violin shop--it's a $25 repair.  Overall, I'm pleased with it as a instrument for a beginner.
