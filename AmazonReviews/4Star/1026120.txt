I am a beginner at violin playing so I thought I would wait a while before writing a review of this bow until I could improve a bit and really try it out. The sound this bow makes is great. My other cheap bow I was using has a very muted sound. This bow definitely helps my tone when I play. It is quite a bit heavier than my cheap bow so that took some adjusting to, but in the end I adapted fine to it. My cheap bow would not hold on to my rosin effectively, and I would have to rosin it way to soon. This bow holds onto it like a champ.<br /><br />The only bad thing I have to say about the bow is some cosmetic damage that was on it when it shipped. There is a small chunk taken out of the bow when I opened the box it came in. I don't know if it was damaged during shipping or was just missed in QA, but there wasn't any padding in the box it arrived in and it was in a plain plastic sleeve that seemed intact.  I didn't feel like dealing with sending it back just for that because it would take time, and I wouldn't have a bow to play with for even longer if I returned it.<br /><br />tl;dr: I think the bow has a pretty good sound compared to the super cheap bows, but packaging/QA weren't the best.
