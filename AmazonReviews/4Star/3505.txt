Not too shabby. THey were replacements for a cheap electric. SInce they were so inexpensive I didn't expect much. I would say they were a little better than the open geared ones. The metal covers are thin but do the job of protecting the gears. A couple of the tuners were a little loose so I slid off the covers and tightened the screws up and adjusted them a bit tighter. Once you screw them down the covers are screwed down too. They seem to be fairly solid - good enough for what I needed which was super low cost and to replace cheap open tuners on an old electric from the sixties.
