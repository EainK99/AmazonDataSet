Great upgrade/replacement speaker for a Fender 25R - breaks up nicely at lower volumes while still maintaining nice crisp highs.<br /><br />The mounting holes lined up perfectly and there are twice as many as needed for most applications (eight lug holes, but most cabinets only use four).<br /><br />I would have given five stars, but I was a little disappointed to discover this speaker is made in China - If I had known that before ordering,. I would have bought an Eminence speaker (USA) [[ASIN:B0009H00WW Eminence Patriot Ragin Cajun 10&#34; Guitar Speaker, 75 Watts at 8 Ohms]].
