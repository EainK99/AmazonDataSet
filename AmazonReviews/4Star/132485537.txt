[[ASIN:B003FJGDL8 Yamaha CG122MS Spruce Top Classical Guitar, Matte Finish]] have been playing guitar for many years, both classical and electric. Both finger style and with a plck. Just bought the yamaha cg122ms classical guitar and love it. Beautiful to look at and play. Sustain for days, great neck, and perfect action. Also i was surprised at how loud the guitar is . You cant beat this guitar for the price,  although it sounds as good as guitars at twice the price.
