first off these headphones sound very good. the ear cushions are nicely padded. it comes with a 3.5 to 1/4 adaptor and it screws on and off so you can you it on your computer or anything with a 3.5 jack. unscrew the adaptor and your ready to plug it in your guitar amp or any 1/4 inch jack. you need to remember the plug is stereo so you can't plug into a mono device without buying stereo to mono adaptors. i did find the headphones to be a little tight and after wear them for a few hours your ears became a little soar. but i fixed that i by heating the top of the headphones with a warm hair dryer to warm it up then i pressed the top of headphones while i bent out the ear section on both sides at same time just a little bit at a time until i get it wide enough to take that extra pressure off your ears. i did this a few times just a little at a time untill i found where they fit the best. so if you do not mind doing this little trick then these headphones will be perfect. but you do this at your own risk as if you spread them to fast or to far you can break them. so do at your own risk, do not hold me resposible for you doing this and you break them. but like i said take your time and it works very well.
