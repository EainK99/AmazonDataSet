They do indeed work. For a novice player like myself, finger tip pain in no longer a limitation. They would also work for someone with a cut finger tip.<br /><br />But they are a little clumsy when your fingers touch other. And it's hard to feel if you're touching another string. And there's a lot of friction when sliding (and I fear I might tear them). Manufacturer suggests using baby powder - I haven't tried. I usually resort to them after my fingers start hurting.<br /><br />Follow manufacturer's instructions for sizing. I was surprised that I took a small, as I wear large gloves, but the manufacturer was right. A little effort to put on and they feel tight, but not enough to hurt and won't come off, while a larger size would. One of the finger tips will be a size smaller for your pinky. Over time they will slip off as you skin oils accumulate on the inside - then you'll need to wash them.<br /><br />Just tore one while trying to put on...<br /><br />I read someone complaining about durability - suggest you keep your nails short.
