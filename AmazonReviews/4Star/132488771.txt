As a vinyl fan’s first “serious” turntable, the Pro-Ject Carbon Debut is a fantastic deal, especially with the preinstalled Ortofon 2M Red cartridge. Hook the table up with a decent preamp (I have a NAD PP2 – not top line but certainly not cheap), and be prepared for some excellent sounds.<br /><br />Setup is a breeze, considering that the cartridge comes pre-installed. Watch the Audio Trends setup tutorial video on You Tube while you’re waiting for your table to arrive, and you can set it up out of the box in about two minutes. I had already purchased a full-size 2mm Way Excellent II turntable mat from Herbie’s Audio Lab, so I never used the mat that comes with the Debut Carbon. (I’m not trying to sell anyone on the Way Excellent but rather explaining my setup…though it is in fact a wonderful mat that I can highly recommend both for improved sonics and greatly reduced static-electric charge.)<br /><br />My only complaint with the Carbon Debut was the motor noise. As others have noted here and elsewhere, the motor has a discernible hum, though it was not through the speakers, just from the unit itself. However, as it couldn’t be heard over the music or even in the spaces between songs, I wasn’t terribly bothered by it.<br /><br />What surprised me was when I purchased the Pro-Ject Speed Box 2 accessory and found that the motor noise disappeared completely. I thought my ears were deceiving me until I switched back and forth between the Carbon Debut on its own and with the Speed Box attached. The Speed Box 2 lets you change speeds without moving the belt on the turntable, which for me is reason enough to buy it. The fact that it provides more stable motor performance and eliminates motor hum makes it an even more desirable accessory. (My only complaint about the Speed Box 2 is that it comes with a stupidly short cable that connects to the power input on the Debut Carbon. The cable is only about 12 inches long, which makes it impossible to set the Speed Box anywhere except to the side of the turntable near the back.)<br /><br />I had intended the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon to be a temporary turntable that I would use until I could afford a Rega RP6. But while the Rega is a nice table and would offer some sonic improvements, I’m no longer thinking about it much. I like the Pro-Ject enough that I’d consider upgrading my preamp or the cartridge before I’d swap out the table, since I think those two components would offer the greatest sonic improvement.<br /><br />My ratings are FOUR STARS for the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon with Ortofon 2M Red, FIVE STARS for the table with the Speed Box 2.
