I bought both this and a Official Fender tremolo arm at the same time so I could compare them because the last one I bought bent in less then a month of normal use. This arm is not identical to the Fender one it has a slightly different angle to it. The fit is perfect and the quality is about the same and it hasn't bent like some of the other cheap tremolos I bought. I would say I actually like the angle on this one slightly more then the official Fender tremolo and that it is very comparable.
