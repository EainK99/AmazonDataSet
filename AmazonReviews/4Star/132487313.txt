The turntable was packed well, assembled easily and plays records with no problems.  The automatic feature is very good and handy when the record is finished.  It withdraws the tone arm and shuts off the unit.  The turntable can be turned on or off by pushing one button for each function.  The weakness of the turntable is the fact that there is no counterbalance on the tone arm.  I have no idea how much pressure the needle is putting on the records that I am playing unless I purchase a tone arm pressure measuring device.  And, even if I did, I could not easily change the weight on the record.  This a nice second turntable for use when I want the automatic feature.  It is a good value for the purpose for which I bought it.  The quality is good for the price.  However, the price did vary as much as $20 while I was deciding whether to purchase.  Audio Technica makes a good product.  I hope that it lasts.  I am leery of the life span of the belt.  But such is the nature of the belt drive turntable.  I would recommend this item for the casual LP record buff.
