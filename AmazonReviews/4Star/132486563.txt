This is a great echo pedal. It simulates a tape echo unit, and has some really nice parameters to get that analogue tape sound. You can adjust how 'new' the tape sounds, and the amount of 'wrinkle' in the tape. Of course there are the usual 'Repeats' & 'Time' functions, but in addition you can specify 'fixed', 'multiple' or 'single' tape heads. The unit also has onboard reverb, and there are secondary parameters behind four of the knobs, which you can access by holding down the Tap and Bypass footswitches simultaneously. All parameters can be controlled via an expression pedal, and you can choose between mono and stereo output.
