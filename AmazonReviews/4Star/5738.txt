Let me start of by saying that these are $30 wireless microphones! That being said...WOW! I am really impressed by these. I was not expecting the quality from these that I got. I ordered these for an out door event that I have coming up that they want to make announcements and a few quick speeches.<br />When these arrived yesterday I took them out to my little sound studio, where I like to jam with my friends, and connected it into my PA System to try them out. After I dialed in the EQ settings for them they actually sounded GOOD. I picked up a guitar and started to play and sing a little bit and they sounded really good through my system. I did notice some popping when I got too close but I have wind screens that I will try which should help with that.<br /><br />Over all I am very pleasantly surprised and happy with these microphones.
