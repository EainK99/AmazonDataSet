The Q2HD video recorder is pretty much worthless without this kit.  The cables and AC power supply are very important in outputting video and in providing confidence during long recording sessions (because of the short battery life during high quality recordings).  The case is nice too and, if recording under windy conditions, the wind screen for the mic is probably useful too.  The tiny stand is not very stable.  A real camera stand is needed to provide the camera stability required for good pictures.
