I've had this unit several months now and use it primarily for playing music during volleyball practice in a full sized gymnasium.  It is perfect for our needs.  Good crisp sound that fills the entire gymnasium.  However, this unit has to be carried in and out of the gym.  The wheels are soft plastic and won't last very long, they are not capable of handling the weight of the speaker.  Also, yes the speaker has a USB port, but you cannot use it to plug in and play iPhone etc.  Bluetooth is the only way to,connect.
