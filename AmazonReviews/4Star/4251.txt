Arrived with a broken piece that guides the cable into the pedal. Not sure what its called, but The plastic was brittle and shattered.<br />I figured a replacement would probably show up damaged too, so I took it to a bicycle shop. They made and installed a custom, metal replacement piece for $40.00.<br />I'm a string player- I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT DRUM PEDALS! There were no instructions, pictures or paper anything which is kinda frustrating.. But I got it put together. Then learned I should've inspected and tightened every nut and screw on the mechanism before use, because it kept falling apart.. (now I know).<br /><br />Now that its all put together, tightened and had the broken pieces replaced,,, It seems to be a pretty good kick pedal.<br />The hardware seems pretty heavy-duty. The mallet sounds really good on my Pearl Big Boom Cajon.<br />I'll keep using it and update if there's any significant issues.
