I purchased the bench for my 7-year old son because the accompanied bench with piano was too low for him and was not adjustable. Therefore the adjustable feature was the main feature I looked for when buying the item. On that part I am satisfied. The bench can be easily adjusted and seems stable.<br /><br />The build and material of the bench may not be as elegant as to your great satisfaction. But it is still looked decent and not cheap. I take away one star for that aspect. But I think I am a rather picky person anyway.
