For the Greek Bouzouki, but not a traditional Greek bouzouki method for those who want to learn to play Greek music.  First, the author uses ADAD tuning rather than the traditional CFAD tuning, plus he strings the octave strings opposite of the traditional way.  That said, I believe the book to be useful to those who want to experiment with a different tuning.  The three course (six string) Bouzouki is tuned DAD.  This method would be helpful to those who want learn the three course bouzouki on a four course (8 string) instrument. I am not sure when, or if I'll use it, but I am glad I bought the book.  The seller was timely in his delivery.
