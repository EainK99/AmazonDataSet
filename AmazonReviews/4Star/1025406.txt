For the price, you're getting as good a product as can be expected, and for casual use or, as in my case, clinical use (I'm a board certified music therapist who works with hospice patients and their families), it's fantastic.  It's not a concert tambourine, and as such it's not terribly durable, particularly the thin goat skin (?) head.  One good fortississimo with your fist and you lose any tone the head originally had.  It's great for kids and for light use, though, and it produces a pleasing, though very thin, tone.  If you're looking for a discount Grover or Black Swamp, though, keep looking.
