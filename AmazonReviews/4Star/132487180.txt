I'm guessing the sensitivity of the subject matter makes this anime hard to find in the US.  I have watched the first four episodes so far and have enjoyed the story.  There is no English dub, but the subtitles are within my reading speed and the emotion comes through from the Japanese voice actors.  Definitely worth a look if you enjoyed the manga.
