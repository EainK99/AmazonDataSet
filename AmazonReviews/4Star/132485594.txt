This brush is non-metal and thus can be used to clean the long thin tubing of a trombone without fear of scratching the surfaces. If you are a trombone player, you really must clean your instrument periodically. There are several reports you can find on people suffering from upper-respiratory infections caused by a dirty trombone. The inside of the inner slide portion starting at the mouthpiece gets a shower of food bits, saliva, etc. as you play. Microorganisms can live inside this slide--it is warm and humid in this slide after you stop playing--and some of those could cause disease! This is a gentle and effective cleaner. The first time I cleaned my instrument, I found not too much in the larger bell or ascending side of the slide, but the descending portion below the receiver was FILTHY. There was a gray-slime that just coated this brush when it came out. I was nearly gagging thinking about every time I was doing those rapid slide motions that we do to make sure the lube is good realizing that the &#34;exhale&#34; backing up the mouthpiece was passing over this gunk and shooting into my face! Yuck. Buy one and use it well. I am not sure how durable this will be as it is new, so I'm holding back a star to &#34;wait and see&#34; so clearly &#34;I like it&#34; but I'm not sure that &#34;I love it&#34; yet.
