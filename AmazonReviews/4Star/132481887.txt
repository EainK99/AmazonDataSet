Works like a charm. Easy to install, keeps the beat of the music when used in audio mode. Place somewhere near speaker and away you go. Get the controller so that you can shut it off without having to pull the plug all the time. Works great for weddings, parties and clubs. Would get 5 stars if they had proper clamps already attached for easy removal from lighting tree.
