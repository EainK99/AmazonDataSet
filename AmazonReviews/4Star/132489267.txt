I found this little gem at G.C. here in Las Vegas. It was used and I had never seen or heard this combo before. I took a Bass off the wall and started jammin' away through it. Within seconds I dialed in a killer tone. Looked around too see if the coast was clear and turned up the amp to about 12 o' clock and was totally amazed that all of that tone and volume could come out of this little thing. What sold me completely on the combo was the weight.33 freakin' lbs?! I stood up to lift the amp and was speechless. I play basically, more than anyone. I have a 5-7 day a week house gig at several different Casino's. I just got  this amp, so as far as dependability, I can't really comment, but as far as tone, ease of use, weight, I am totally blown away. Is it perfect? no. The horn hiss is audible, There is no tune mute,<br />the xlr is backwards, the limiter is on or off so you don't really know when it's limiting and there is no tuner out.<br />all that taken into consideration, Here is my rebuttal to these issue's: On stage, with a drummer, you are not going to hear the horn hiss. You can plug your tuner into the other input and it works as a tuner out. All you need is a car key or small screw driver or even a coin to unplug the xlr. Finally, as long as the limiter is protecting, I have piece of mind while playing. There are 2 things that really shocked me about this combo: 1. how much low end there is. I had to immediately cut the bass about 6 db. 2. how loud it can get. That much sound just should not be coming out of this little 33lb. 350watt(no extension cab)Combo. Head room for days.<br />I have been playing Bass for 26 years non stop. I play minimum,5 nights a week. Now, I am even more excited to go to my gigs. Thx GK, you will have a customer for life.JPR
