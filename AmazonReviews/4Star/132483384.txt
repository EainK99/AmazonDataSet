Needed some strap buttons for the guitar I just bought for my dad and he loves them! Got them just in a few days.<br />Obviously the strap buttons could be of higher quality (maybe charge $7 instead of $9?) but they do the job just<br />right. Once your playing, you forget about them. As long as the buttons don't snap off half-song, so far a great product.
