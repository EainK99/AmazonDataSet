I just installed this stand. It works great so far. Holds angles well and it plenty big enough for my needs.<br />Now I am disappointed at how hard it was to install due to a misrepresentation. I purposely bought the stand thinking it would be the pull ball option for securing the clamp. However it is the normal T ones. Since I don't have much over hang before it hits my desk drawers this caused it to be much harder then the other clamp tightener.<br />I would have given it 5 stars had the pictures been accurate to what I received.
