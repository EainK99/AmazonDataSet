This rack is very heavy duty and held my mixer at a suitable height and angle to give easy access to the dials and controls. You can adjust the angle of the support arms easily.<br /><br />I had just acquired a 23\\" wide by 20\\" tall mixer/amp and the arms on this rack were well positioned to support it.<br /><br />My 4 star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the stand, which is excellent, but has to do instead with my needs. I was looking for one that I could fold up easily for transport. This RS 9050 rack can be stored flat (it came in flat in the shipping box). But to get it flat again required the removal of 8 bolts. I estimate it would take about 5-10 minutes to accomplish this breakdown--more time and trouble than I wanted to take after each gig.
