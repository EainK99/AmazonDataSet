No longer in production, I recently bought one of these devices from a Japanese dealer's back storage.  It is everything I'd hoped for.  Hardware samplers are not as popular as software samplers, probably because the flexibility of software is substantially superior to the hardware option.  But, I love making minute adjustments to a multitude of parameters when jamming with my &#34;homies&#34; so I was seeking a real-time sampling and sequencing solution.  The Korg Microsampler is just the ticket.  It has a fairly intuitive interface, sampling is mostly straightforward, and it offers a ton of satisfying tweaks.  This is not a tool to do intricate sound sculpting; its strength is as a performance device.  Despite a miniaturized keyboard, the keys are velocity sensitive, and serve multiple functions.  Although the printed manual is in Japanese, it was easy to locate and download an English language version.  It is serviceable but not as detailed as I would prefer.
