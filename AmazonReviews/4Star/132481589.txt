This set of bars is intended to help a drummer attach electronics to a drum rack securely. It's very well made (I love Gibraltar hardware). I'm using a 15\\" MacBook Pro running Superior Drummer as the voice module for my studio drum kit, the sound is amazing and I'd give this Gibraltar hardware 5-stars except the various parts that touch the laptop computer are not all covered in rubber, the knurled knobs on the rear adjustable grippers scratched the top (lid) of my MacBook. I've got the Gibraltar arms covered with a towel now to prevent future scratches. I'd like these better if they had more rubber on them to protect the computer. The towel does not look good but at least it protects my laptop.<br /><br />I'll probably make a piece of wood that clamps in these Gibraltar arms and acts like a secure table in the near future to eliminate the towel.<br /><br />Good luck and good music to all!
