I really like the size of this tuner and how nicely it folds up so as not to take up a lot of room in my guitar case.  It also seems very accurate and I like the size of the letters on the screen (as well as the dial).  I wish there were some way of re-orienting the screen image.  If you clip the tuner onto the end of the head, the letters are sideways.  It's still easy enough to read and I've kind of gotten used to this, but it annoyed me at first.
