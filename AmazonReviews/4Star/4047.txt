Pretty great studio monitors except be aware they are ported which messes with how you perceive your low end. Some newer producers out there might not know about ported and non-ported designs for monitors, so just throwing that out there. For the price, these are fantastic though. Perfect for beginning and setting up a small studio. Just remember to find other ways to perfect your low end.
