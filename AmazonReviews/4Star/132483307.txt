I love this thing. The build quality is good. It's very solid and has some weight to it. The only part of the build I'm not very happy with is the knobs. But you can go to DJ Tech Tools and get some fantastic replacements. It would have been nice to have built in note mode and step sequencer but you can search the web and figure out how to get that to work. Overall I would say this thing is great and the price is fantastic. This is a very useful and versatile tool.
