This was perfect for my 2 month old nephew who isn't always an easy sleeper and scares easily. This brought him comfort right away. Something about the soft sound it makes when you shake comforts them. My sister was able to put this in her purse while traveling on an airplane. I didn't think that he would be able to hear the sound but he could. A lot of other passengers asked her where she got it from.
