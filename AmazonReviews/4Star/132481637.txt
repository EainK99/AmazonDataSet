For the price it's good but I don't know if it's really an intermediate flute. It seems like more of a beginner flute. I would have given it 5 stars, except the headjoint is slightly loose and a piece of membrane came off of the G# pad. Hopefully the pad really is a double bladder. I don't think it's leaking but I'm not good enough to say for sure.
