I have an electric hollowbody that required work on three frets. I made sure that the frets were seated all the way, so after some research on the Web, I located the Bogdanovich Buzz-Off kit. For the relatively low price, I thought, \\" What the heck!\\" It beat handing over wads of cash for a pro set-up, which I knew I didn't need. So I watched the video, but mostly just went by the simple printed instructions included. I soon realized that I didn't need to dress full frets, but just sand down some rises in the frets on a specific string. So I taped off the surrounding areas and went to work, leaving the strings on so I could intermittently check the string for the buzzing I was hoping to get rid of. The only aspect that surprised me was how much work was required to sand down the brass frets - I took to heart other reviewers' experience of over-sanding the frets and making a re-fret job required. So I expected a few quick goes with the heavier 220 grit sandpaper, some back-up with the 400 grit, and a quick polishing with the steel wool (all included). Well, it was a bit more than that, and because I was not sanding the entire frets but only specific isolated areas, using the slotted wood piece required some dexterous handling. But the end result is great, and I now have a buzz-free jazz box that I can use on my next gig! I recommend this kit as a very good value - just know its limitations and expect to do some work!
