Hey Everyone, let me just say that this thing is pretty awesome.<br />To start off Im just going to mention that yes it is possible to start learning with out a mixer that buying this is not complete necessary because with Virtual DJ you can download a free version and use your computer and mouse to mix pretty simple, BUT let me say this mixing on a computer vs a DJ Controller is a big difference. When I started getting into DJ'ing I tried with just my mouse and free software and it was just plain Jane boring.... so I went out on a limb and bought this and since then I mix every night wether it sounds like crap or sounds better than the original songs. So I believe if you have the spare cash around than this is a nice find. Now I have been told its a waste and Il explain the pros and cons in a second, but why people say it is a waste cause you will outgrow it pretty fast. Which is true I do feel like I want some more knobs, effects and some more stuff but starting off with this you dont feel scared. So after my rant here are the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros<br />PRICE$$$ - Cheaply Affordable<br />Easy To Learn On - Begginers will feel comfortable<br />Comes w/ Virtual DJ LE - All you need to start learning<br />Fast & Easy Installation - Jump right in<br /><br />Cons<br />No built in interface card - Not a biggy but still if your not pre-pared for this it will kind of suck<br />Virtual DJ LE version (Limited) - LE Does stand for limited, but just sucks that you cant do to much without buying the software<br />Sync - While good for a begginer I think that its going to make people not learn beatmatching and hence cheating<br /><br />Thats all I really have to say about it. I do recommend this to all begginers that are really wanting to start out, but if your second guessing it than maybe just stick to only computer and software.<br />Hope This Helps Someone Get Started DJ'ing!
