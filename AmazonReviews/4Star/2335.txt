Cry a little more.... oh you didn't get it on time for a drum event! Truly drumming is about sound. Looking cool is always a part of being a musician but I bought this to endorse the best sounding cymbals on the market! I support zildjian products wherever I go...get over it. Thiers way more to worry about if being a drummer is priority #1. Preformence should be what matters!-zach
