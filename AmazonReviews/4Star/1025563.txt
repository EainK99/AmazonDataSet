This ad on Amazon clearly states &#34;Yamaha&#34; as the brand. When I received my first stool I looked at the box carefully and examined the stool carefully, it does not say Yamaha anywhere on any of what I received.<br /><br />On the bottom of the stool it is labeled as &#34;The Music People&#34; which I believe is the real brand. Without the Yamaha brand I probably would not have ordered one, I've found Yamaha hardware to be top notch so I trusted Amazon and bought one. Because of all this branding bait and switch I took off one star from what I would have reviewed as a 5-star product.<br /><br />These stools are great, comfortable, the right size, seems sturdy for up to 200 pound humans, easy to move around, padding provides excellent butt support, I liked my first one so much I bought a second one so I would not have to keep stealing the one out of the keyboard pit area.<br /><br />Delivery was right on time and for about $27 including shipping these are excellent equipment for any music studio (compare it to the Yamaha stool from Musicians Friend or Guitar Center at over $60 in their stores).<br /><br />These stools are the right height for playing piano and also work well for sitting and playing acoustic or electric guitar since there are no chair arms to get in the way. I teach music and nobody has complained about the new stools so I'm thinking they are working for me.<br /><br />Good luck and good music to all!<br /><br />With the exception of the dubious claims about this being a Yamaha product I think these stools are fantastic and easily worth the $27 price.<br /><br />Good luck and good music to all
