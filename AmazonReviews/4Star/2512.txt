This is a good speaker if you know what you are doing. Keep it equalized and powered within its limits and you will be satisfied. I strongly suggest that you refrain from channeling a  moderate or heavy bass load. Just push it with mids and highs. Keep in mind the 500 watt rating is the max peak for only seconds of use. The CONTINUOUS rating  is 250 watts. In the long run....it's worth the price.
