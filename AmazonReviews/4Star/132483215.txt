I used these red LED strips to add some accent lighting to the footwells in my car. They turned out amazing, and add the perfect amount of light. They also do not draw a lot current or generate much heat.<br /><br />The only downsides to this product are that they are very difficult to solder, even with my professional soldering station. Also, the 3M tape on the back doesn't stick to the actual strips very well, and had to use some hot glue to make them stick. Even with these minor problems, I still love these LED's and would recommend them to anyone.
