I have been using this for awhile now and really like it. It sounds really good especially for its size. For a time I would even use it outside the shower when I needed a sound boost. The rechargeable battery lasts for at least couple weeks (enough that I don't remember when I charged it last) with minimal daily usage.<br />I would recommend this product. The only negatives I have found was there isn't much notice when the battery finally does die. It typically dies mid shower. The other negative was no ability to advance songs. I am sure someone wants to be able to answer the phone in the shower (really?) but I would rather have better control of the external device. Still the negatives don't keep me from recommending it.
