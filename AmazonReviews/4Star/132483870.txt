I bought this keyboard for my husband as a wedding gift along with a bench and foot pedal. The piano itself is great. the hammer action keys seem to work really well and it's got a lot of fun settings and great sound. It's a great piano for the price (considering other hammer action digital pianos I looked at were in the thousands). My only concern is the foot pedal that comes with the piano (it doesn't mention that it comes with a foot pedal in the review so I bought one and now we have two...) doesn't seem to hold the note longer and it seems fairly cheaply made.  I'm going to try the one that I bought and see if it's any better.  But overall it's a great piano for the price and will be great for my husband and I until we can afford a real upright.
