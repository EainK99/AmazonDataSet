This is a nice pedal, i had sent it from Japan because they don't sell it in the USA but anyway i was expecting a little more, thats the only thing i have to say. It has good gain and volume, you can play with it anyway you want. Like it says in the description you can play all styles of rock you want, vintage, and some metal. Like Marshall product the sound is really warm.<br />It does a little noise when you aren't playing but it's not major, and if you really can't stand it you can still get a noise gate (pedal) to stop it.
