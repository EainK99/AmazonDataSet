Ordered the Rover after a broken right shoulder kept me from playing my full size guitars.  It doesn't sound like my Martin --is a bit plunky, but is really fun and pleasing especially when playing with other instruments.  It's cute too!  Replaced the strings with Martin silk and steels, which helped.  No neck adjustment was needed and even when I can play a full sized guitar, I'll continue to take this guitar with me.  Very nice fitted case and a great purchase.  Received very quickly with standard shipping.  No smell as some have mentioned.
