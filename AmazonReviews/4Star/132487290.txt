This is a great little DAC. For those looking to get the most out of your music collection, be it from your computer or an iOS device, you can not go wrong here.<br /><br />I've owned this \\"One\\" and the previous \\"One\\" as well (twice). First one was stolen, second one was returned because I saw the press release for this \\"One\\".<br /><br />Same great sound, but portable. Broke it out and used it with my iPhone right away. The sound, even on my earpods, was markedly different. Have not tested it with my Sony Mdr1r's yet, but I would imagine it will sound incredible with them as well. Will update once tested.<br /><br /> The real test, though, was the home rig with my Focal 807 vw bookshelf speakers.<br /><br />What a huge difference.<br /><br />This thing blows my Peachtree Decco 65 out of the water and its not even close. The aireness of the highs and the accurate, detailed midrange is just a joy to listen too. What really gets me though, is the instrument separation. I don't know how Apogee does it, but there DACS make me feel like the band is right in front of me. Clear, crisp, well defined sound from the moment it's hooked up.<br /><br />Setup is as follows:<br /><br />MacBook Pro > Apogee One > Dared SL2000a > Decco 65 > Focal 807 vw<br /><br />Absolutely prefer the DAC in the One to the DAC in the Decco 65. I'm still suprised to this day that Apogee products don't get more recognition in the world of Hifi.<br /><br />Have an Emotiva UPA 200 on route. At that point, the D65 will be on the block.<br /><br />Can't wait to compare this to the Geek DAC, which is slated for delivery in January. Great as it's specs are, it will have one hell of a fight on its hands to dethrone the \\"One\\".<br /><br />**********************<br />Edit 9/17<br />Changed from 5 to 4 stars:<br /><br />First unit failed while in use as a headphone DAC powered by batteries. Click distortion and would not play audio. Exchanged for a new unit which is working fine with my stereo setup.<br /><br />Seems another customer had a DOA unit as well. Could be cause for concern for Apogee.Seems another customer had a DOA unit as well. Could be cause for concern for Apogee.
