So why would pros use a product that's so obviously NOT a &#34;fine musical instrument&#34;?  When you look at this thing - it's not just the size that reminds you of a toy - it's not that it's cheaply made - it's just not a fine musical instrument and there's not much attempt at that.  I got the fretless model and it sounds 85% of a string bass and it goes easily in the overhad bin / is crazy portable and it's easy to play.  (no bowing, of course).  You can practice on it by yourself but don't even think about playing with a fiddle or guitar player - you won't be heard without amplification (of course the piezo and electronics are built in).  Strings are really stretchy - count on some patience in tuning it up the first time.  If you doubt that pros use this thing - check out the Youtue videos.  My buddy Byron Isaacs (Ollabelle, Amy Helm, etc..) loves it.  It just makes practicing and playing a lot easier by taking much of the logisitcs out of being a bass player.
