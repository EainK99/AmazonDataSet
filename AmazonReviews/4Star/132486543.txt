THIS IS NOT A TOP-QUALITY INSTRUMENT, I didn't expect such for less than $1000.<br />Touch is somewhat uneven, but fine for beginners, key-weighting is good for building hand strength, but not the best for a highly-experienced player. The chorus is EXCELLENT, the reverb less, but quite acceptable. All of the voices are at least decent, and the limited polyphony not particularly objectionable.<br />THIS IS A GREAT BEGINNER INSTRUMENT AT LIST PRICE. Buy at any substantial discount, and this is unbeatable.<br />I bought this to A-B to a Yamaha P-35, the difference in list price makes this a winner (and real MIDI pretty much takes care of any feature shortfall)- the weight difference was the deal breaker for my student, but this is about 85% less weight than even a spinet...and I move them by myself all the time, even at age 60.
