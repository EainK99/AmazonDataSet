EDIT: Below is my original review. At the time of the posting, the seller had it listed as a Concert Ukulele not a Soprano. It took them a while to change it to the correct listing so I gave it two stars but said I would give it 3 stars if they corrected the listing. I have now lived up to my end of the bargain.<br /><br />The original review is below if you would like to read it, but the gist of it is that this is a great beginner ukulele, the tuner is fantastic and the bag is pretty darn nice. With that in mind, the price is a little steep for a Makala ukulele and if you look around you can probably find a true Kala package for this price or a few dollars more. If you don't care to do that, this ukulele package is perfectly good and I would have given it a 4 star review if the price was just a tad lower! So if you want to get started, you won't go wrong with this package.<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Alright, so as the title to this review says, the product IS NOT a concert Ukulele but rather a Soprano. I contacted the seller and was told that it was an error on the part of Kala the maker of the instrument because they supposedly gave them the wrong UPC code. While this may be true, how in the world can you be a seller of Ukuleles and not know the difference between a Concert Ukulele and a Soprano? Before putting up a listing on Amazon, I would think you'd check out your inventory and make sure it matches.<br /><br />Also, since I notified them over 24 hours ago, they still have not fixed the listing or taken it down which means that if they truly didn't know the difference before, they do now and they have continued selling the incorrect product.<br /><br />As for the Ukulele, its overpriced since you can generally get a regular Kala for this price with a bag and a tuner. For those who don't know, Kala tends to be a little better quality while Makala is more of a cheap beginner or child ukulele.<br /><br />Thats not to say Makala isn't good, I'm simply pointing it out because for this price point you'd be better off getting a Kala.<br /><br />The actual quality of this Ukulele is pretty good. It seems solid and compared to my Kala Soprano they are virtually identical except my Kala has much better tuning gears, a hole pattern that makes it look less plain, and MUCH better strings.<br /><br />The sound is pretty rough with these strings but I am confident that with new strings (Aquila Red's are my personal favorite for Kala and Makala ukuleles) it will sound pretty good. (Note: If you are new to ukuleles it will take about 3 days of constant tuning before the strings will settle and it will stay tuned pretty well after that. This happens with all ukuleles so don't freak out.)<br /><br />The bag and tuner that come with it are surprisingly nice and almost make the overpayment worth it but its still not quite there.<br /><br />The packaging is nice, but the ukulele I received came in a box that had obviously been re-taped and the box was really busted up. This leads me to believe that it had been returned before and re-packaged probably because someone ordered it expecting a concert ukulele and received a soprano.<br /><br />Overall, I would bump this to a 3 if it was listed correctly (a 4 if the price was lowered a little) because its a great starter ukulele that gets you up and running for under $100. If you are looking for a soprano ukulele, case, and tuner, spend a few bucks more and get a Kala. Better yet, go to your local music store and you can usually pick up a Kala with tuner and basic gig bag for the same price.<br /><br />I was given a discount in exchange for testing and reviewing this product. Needless to say, the review above is based solely on my experience with this and other Ukuleles.Makala isn't good, I'm simply pointing it out because for this price point you'd be better off getting a Kala.
