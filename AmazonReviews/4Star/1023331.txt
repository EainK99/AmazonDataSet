Nice guitar for the price.  There was a problem with the delivery, but the company did a very nice job in contacting me back apologizing for the delay in delivery.  The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is that the guitar itself does not hold a tune too well.  I am going to try and change out the strings and see if that makes a difference.  Other than that, it is a good product for decent price and your child will enjoy it.
