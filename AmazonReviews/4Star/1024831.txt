It's tough, durable and doesn't let rainwater get inside easily. At the beginning, it results a little bit complicated to distribute things inside, as its compartments are not standard for anything except for the recorder, but you can cut the inside foam, so it gives you more space without losing the protection it gives to your equipment (for example, no standard boom mic can go inside the default foam shape, neither horizontally nor vertically). You have to adapt it so all the space is useful. Also, it's kind of heavy for your shoulders for using it during long time if you're not used to that. Good but not perfect.
