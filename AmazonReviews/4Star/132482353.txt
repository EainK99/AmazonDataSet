This is one of the cheapest lapel microphones available. The sound quality is, surprisingly, quite good. Of course, the biggest advantage of any lavalier microphone is the ability to maintain the same sound level regardless of your position relative to the camera, and the Audio-Technica ATR-3350 also provides that.<br /><br />The microphone doesn't seem sturdy, but I used the previous model (ATR-35), which is very similar to this one, for 6 years before it finally fell apart. Compared to ATR-35, this newer model has a stereo connector which is very good because modern cameras, especially DSLRs, usually record only the left channel if your microphone has a mono connector.<br /><br />Like the older model, this microphone uses LR44/SR44 batteries. It still has no power indicator and if you forget to turn it off, it will completely drain the battery overnight. That's why I usually carry a pair of spare batteries in my camera bag. But I'd really like to see a LED power indicator. That's why I give this mic only 4 stars.
