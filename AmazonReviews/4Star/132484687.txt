These are respectable cables at a good price. They are not built like tanks, so do not get them if you need to abuse them. That said, they are not going to fall apart without help. In terms of color, these cables are the equivalent of white wall tires if that would bother you. The 4-inch white ends do stick out. They are good for using at open mics because there is no way to get them mixed up with someone else's cable, but they might clash with your instrument.
