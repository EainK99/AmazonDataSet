These cables are an incredible value and provide excellent sound when they fit right.<br /><br />I have bought a lot of Seismic Audio cables and snakes for my old-old school recording studio. The wire is flexible, low capacitance and the plugs feel sturdy, I have never received a bad or malfunctioning cable which is a good thing considering these are very inexpensive and sourced from China.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the XLR connectors (especially the male ones) sometimes do not mate easily with other XLR connectors by Switchcraft and Neutrik. The male connectors also sometimes do not want to easily separate from other major brands of XLR cable ends, this sometimes requires a small jewelers screwdriver to push down the XLR-connector-latch a little farther to get it to release and separate.<br /><br />They seem to mate fine with other Chinese produced connectors so possibly there is a measurement difference, not sure.<br /><br />Ultimately these cables would be my first choice because of the low price and quality audio performance, I have enough other brands to work around any hassles the connector sizes present.<br /><br />The 16 x 16 S.A. XLR-TRS 5'- snake I purchased is another amazing piece for only $50 but that is another S A product :-)<br />If you're looking for cables to connect your sound or recording system check out Seismic Audio, they have many sizes and configurations here on Amazon and you can't beat that Prime delivery.<br /><br />Siesmic Audio offers even more incredible pricing direct from their website and they have shipped my orders via Priority Mail from Alabama so I still get orders direct from SA in two days, the advantage of buying direct is, either more cables for same money or less money for same cable package on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Amazon taught me to love Seismic Audio and to discover their web site, now I'm ordering direct from S.A. and getting even better value.<br /><br />Good luck and good music to everyone!
