This piccolo really feels cheap... that's because it is both in quality and price.  Keys work and pads close.  Out of the box headjoint fit was rough and finger keys were very slippery, but it played and sounded as good as the school's piccolo.  Case isn't very durable looking.  For the price exactly what I expected so I can't complain.  If it holds up it will have been a great value for under a hundred bucks.
