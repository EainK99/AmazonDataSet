I received this a couple of days ago, so admittedly have only just started playing with it. The plug in was easy. Used the USB input to my Mac, plugged in the headphones and was able to quickly listen to the internal samples provided with the machine. Then downloaded the free editor, percussion samples, and loops from the Akai website and was able to quickly extract hundreds of samples to the Mac. Transferred them all to an SD card and then plugged the card into the controller. Very intuitive and easily maneuverable controls. 8 pads to which you can allocate the software provided samples or your own. The pads are very tactile and responsive, and respond to more or less force and pressure. This would be ideal for DJ or live performer, but also for the home recording guy like me. I have already started using in conjunction with Garage Band on my Mac. For $99 you can't beat this. Well made, lightweight yet sturdy, and easy to plug in and use. Recommended.
