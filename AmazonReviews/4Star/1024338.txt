These sound pretty good , I use them with motorcycle so with the ambient noise its a little hard to notice quality. a little tricky to put on , but once you get it right they reduce noise more than any ear plugs i ever tried , I really had doubts about the advertised NRR , but it must be true or close to that.<br />I can have them on for about an hour before they start to cause pain , might be the pressure from my tight fit helmet or the large size foams I use but that the compromise for the noise reduction.
