For the money this isn't too bad of a case.  I wouldn't classify it as road worthy, but if you're looking for something to offer some protection for your guitar that won't break the budget, this will do.  I bought an Epi EJ200SCE and tried several other cases in the 150 to 200 prince range and none of the other jumbo cases would fit due to the protrusion of the knobs from the pre-amp.  This epi case has that portion of the case scooped out (less padding) so that the EJ200SCE slides in.  The guitar fits snuggly into the case.  I just wished that there was more layers of plywood, like 5-ply to offer more protection.  The lid has to be pushed over the edge in order to engage the latches.  Quality control isn't quite what it should be, but then again, you are getting what you paid for...taking that in consideration, this case is worth the money that you are paying.
