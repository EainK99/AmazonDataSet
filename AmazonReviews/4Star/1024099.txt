This is a great little FX box.  It has emulations of most of the well known Bass FX out there, and its simple to use.  You can stack up to 5 FX on each patch, and each individual FX has adjustments to dial in the tone you want.  There are features that other multi FX don't have such as built in drum rhythms, a loop recorder, aux in... so you can do a lot with this pedal even if you don't have an amp, all you need is a set of headphones and a 1/4&#34; adapter.  My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is that this pedal creates some static noise when plugged in, so recording with it isn't optimal.  I get it on both my amp and headphones, where direct into my AMP with the same bass guitar is dead silent (active EMGs always are!)  For practicing, jamming & playing live however this thing is going to give you a huge range of tones that sound really good.
