This is a MAGNETIC pickup. Do not get this for a nylon string guitar. It's a little flat single coil pickup in a simple, but effective mount.  It's probably flat enough to go under the strings on an archtop too, if the mounting &#34;ears&#34; were cut off and it was mounted in another way.The output is OK, the sound is typical for a magnetic pickup, and it's a little noisy. It's a single coil after all. For the price, I think it's a neat pickup.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have about this pickup is another typical issue with magnets - string balance. It doesn't seem to have any compensation for the fact that acoustic strings don't all react the same with a magnetic pickup. The unwound high E and especially the B are louder than the wound strings. It's not too noticeable at low volume, but if you're turning it up, you'll hear the top two strings louder than the rest. I might experiment with some form of ferrous shielding under those strings to balance things out.
