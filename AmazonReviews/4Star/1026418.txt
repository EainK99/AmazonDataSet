For the first month it worked great. Good audio quality, fit well, charged fast, connected easily with my phone's bluetooth, etc.  By ~35 days of use, it no longer would charge at all. Completely dead. Amazon's return window was 30 days, so I thought I was out of luck.  I contacted the manufacturer and they responded right away via email, and sent me a new one! Great customer service. So far the 2nd one is working great, so I am happy with the purchase. I'll update if this one dies, otherwise if you read this then it must still be working.
