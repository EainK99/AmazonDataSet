Better than expected at this price. Looks good - certainly doesn't look cheap. And the quality of the sound is quite good.<br /><br />One star off because one of the reeds is wrong. A #10 hole blow produces a G6 note - same as for the #9 hole. (Confirmed by both ear and instrumentation.) It should produce a C6 note (same as a #7 blow) per their own insert. I'm assuming I got a bad unit and this isn't the norm for this harmonica..<br /><br />This would be a good choice for kids. Or even an adult starting out - to see if  you actually like playing the harmonica. If if turns out you don't, you haven't lost much.<br /><br />And a particular hot button of mine: A major evil is giving a kid something that's so cheap and poor in quality that it frustrates rather than teaches and inspires.  This harmonica is satisfactory.<br /><br />PS - One nice feature of their insert: Under the drawing of the harmonica holes showing the blow and draw notes, they put a music staff showing the notes in standard music notation. I found that helpful.
