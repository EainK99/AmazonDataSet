The person in the video should try moving the other capos around, sometimes being closer to the fret makes a difference or straigtening, or angling etc... can make a difference He just plunks it down in one spot and when the sound isn't clear he gives up. It needs adjustment is all. Try that.<br /><br />Just got mine today. will review soon.<br /><br />I finally tried to use this capo, I say tried because it does not do the job. I can't see how all these people got it to work. The packaging does not explain the simple directions but it does take a bit of thought. The video showed how it doubles back and underneath so, voila, did that. No matter how hard I pull on the strap and push the capo down on the stings only the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th string are clear.<br />The other 2 buzz and are not clear. I have a Martin D28 and lost my old cheapo capo I've had for years - pull the strap and hook into a groove which worked really well. I had high hopes for this but cannot get it tight enough. Any tips on using it would be appreciated.
