Seems to work great so far. Pretty sturdy on it's own but you probably wan't to keep something on top of the feet like a dj coffin or a keyboard (Akai MPK61 in my case). Assembly is pretty straight forward once you figure out how to do it. Mine had no instructions for the main unit itself, just some poorly written ones for the optional shelf.<br /><br />Haven't used the clamps but they're nice to have.<br /><br />For assembly, I watched a review on youtube of a near identical product: Oddysey L Stand.<br /><br />I don't think I'm allowed to link out of here, but it's the one that's about 17 minutes long.<br /><br />You'll have left over screws and washers, I wouldn't worry about it.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the plastic knobs with the wing nuts are supposed to help keep stuff on the tray. There's also a velcro strap for this.
