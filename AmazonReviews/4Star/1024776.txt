I was impressed genuinely that it all fit in the relatively small box it came in. Came with everything that the the product description said would come as far as I could tell. Having never worked or used a violin before, seems about as good as I could expect for a low-price point instrument. The top 'pegs' I guess where a bit flimsy but anyone who knows at least a bit more about violins than me could fix the issue with a round of googling. The rosin didn't seem to work when I tried to run it through the strings, but again, since I don't have experience with rosin this might be what it normally looks like. But, it was a pretty rough piece of rosin with almost a hard candy appearance. The violin appeared to have nice construction and was sturdier than I'd of figured for the price point.
