I've played round wounds for roughly seven years. The decision to switch to flatwounds came along as most people - I wanted a more upright sound. First off I did a complete body mod of my bass removing frets and reworking the body, I installed these strings after refinishing the neck. Still on the &#34;out of box&#34; pickups I get a semi almost upright sound but only if I play close towards the neck with the treble raised midway (on a Washburn bass). I love how &#34;organic&#34; it sounds but at the same time its nowhere near the actual upright bass boom.  Many people on here posted about how much different their playing sounded...meh. To me its a mind over matter thing with these strings, yes they sound nice but honestly, with proper technique you can achieve a similar sound quality with round wounds. The major difference is the &#34;noise&#34; factor. There will be no fancy Korn-esque muffing and scrapping while using these strings- they are silent! With a good amount of pressure I get a nice Jaco sound but that could also be attributed to my fret removal, using Wooten's method's these strings can sound righteously funky (yes, funk on these can sound great), they are great for doing oldschool covers in general as they do boost that soulful thump (if handled properly) one can hear in motown music. But as I said....mind over matter.  All in all get these strings just to try something new. If you rather not deal with the grooves of roundwounds on your fingers. If you are a noob who struggles with certain hand positions. Or if you rather have cool looking strings on your bass (sexy, and they're not even nylon!).  As warning my strings had a strange residue on them out of package that felt grimy, after wiping them down with a worn t-shirt it was perfect.
