I'm a guitar player and wanted to start playing bass.  So I looked for a cheap starter guitar.  I think it sounds good and it seems well built.  I've only played with it a little.  The E string rattles a lot but I'm sure its because my fingers aren't used to the big strings.  The other strings are fine.  The picture shows a more natural wood color, but mine is a solid black color....????? The black still looks good in my opinion though.  I don't have much to compare it to but in my opinion its a good starter guitar for what it is worth.  On the listing it said it is about 350 dollars, I don't know about that, if that's true I guess I got a good deal.
