I've just used my new Behringer B210D speaker at my 4 piece band rehearsal.  It really punches above its weight.  I'm using it as a vocal foldback, so I don't really need all of the bottom end a larger speaker would provide.  The clarity and volume is absolutely amazing for a speaker that, lets face it, looks like and weighs the same as a toy.  I'm very happy with the build quality, the low price and the features.  The B210D has a 1/4\\" Jack input, a XLR input and an XLR link output.  Level and High and Low EQ adjustment as well.  You can lay it on its side or mount it on a pole.  Its plenty loud enough to do an acoustic gig in the corner of a restaurant with vocals and a guitar or a keyboard.  Lots of flexibility there.  I'm not sure how long it will last with a couple of gigs a weekend but for the price you can't go past it.
