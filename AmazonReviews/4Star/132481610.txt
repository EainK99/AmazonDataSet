As a professional speaker/lecturer, I've had my share of microphones over the years. My favorite is the Countryman headset, but at $700 or so, they are hard to justify. Standard lavaliers usually have poor quality when used with hotel sound systems. Having the mic right next to your mouth is a great benefit viz sound quality and consistency--sound doesn't drop if you turn your head to look at the screen. This is a good little mic, although a little bulky. But well worth the price.
