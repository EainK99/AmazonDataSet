We bought this for our 13 year old son who wanted to learn playing electric guitar.  Since I am not an expert I can only say that it seem to be a very well made and it is kind of heavier than I expected.  The only thing that made me a little disappointed is that the color is such a dark navy blue that it almost looks like black.  My son wanted a blue guitar and this is blue only if you look at it carefully under a very bright light !  But my son is happy so that is OK !
