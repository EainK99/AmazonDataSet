The item was just as described; a cool little amp. Doesn't get loud, but makes my Strat about as loud as a full bodied acoustic...with a little crunchier tone.<br /><br />Would be cool if you could clip a caribener to it, I try but the little metal piece you can clip to is really flimsy.<br /><br />For the money, for what it is, if recommend it to anyone who wants to practice quietly or have some fun w/ your electric using just a battery!
