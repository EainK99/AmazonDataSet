I thought I'd give try because of the extra tonal options (compared to my Fulltone OCD). First thing I noticed  was how lite it was compared to the OCD, but with that said I think it could stay on a pedal board for many years with no problems.  I mostly use overdrive pedals as a boost to my lead channel, as I like amp distortion better than pedal distortion, or just use the pedal for alittle grit  on the clean channel. Now maybe I've gotten so use the OCD, but the Gain Changer just lacks alittle dimension and warmth and it does color your tone a bit. Everything about sound is subjective, what sounds good on my rig, might not be right for you.  Will I keep the Gain Changer ? - at this moment I'd say no, but I will give alittle more time to see if it can change my ears
