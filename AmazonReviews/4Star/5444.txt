I have noise sensitive neighbors, but need to practice, and this is great!  It sucks up battery life fast so I suggest rechargeable AAAs get purchased too.  It comes with a pack of off the wall brand batteries, but once they start to dwindle you get a weird buzzy feedback in the earphones that's completely unbearable.
