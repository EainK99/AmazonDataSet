These strings are fine for the price. The sound volume and quality are good for a 1/2 size violin, except that the A and E strings sound a bit muted. They don't produce enough resonance as the other two strings do. This could be issues with my violin too. Another problem is that only E and G strings have this tiny plastic &#34;sleeve&#34; on them which stays between the strings and the bridge to prevent the strings from cutting into the bridge. A and D strings don't have this. This is a bit strange. I have sets that have all the strings with this sleeve on, or only on E string, or not at all. Expensive strings won't have this kind of problem.
