I'm a guitar newbie but I've been a musician for over 20 years (primarily a pianist). I put these strings on my Yamaha FD01S acoustic guitar yesterday. I have highly trained ears and trust what they tell me about sound. The lower (bass) strings are not as resonant as I'd like them to be (i.e., insufficient sustain and depth of tone). The top strings are an ENTIRELY different story. I LOVE the sound towards the top. They are crystal clear, have tremendous sustain and sophistication of tone. If you play mostly chords interspersed with lead (melody) stuff, you will enjoy these strings on your acoustic guitar. I can also imagine these working out quite well for fingerstyle playing. All of this depends on the kind of music you will play of course (i.e., if it is mostly concentrated on the trebles, you will fall in love with these strings).<br /><br />I also bought the EJ17 medium gauge strings, will try them out next and will update the review with a comparison. Those will hopefully give me a more resonant bass. Will be interesting to see what happens with the treble with those strings.<br /><br />P.S. I bought the EJ11 strings at my local music store and the EJ17 on amazon.
