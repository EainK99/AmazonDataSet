Our  daughter is taking guitar this year, so we looked into renting  $16 per month x 9 =$144, as a starter guitar this is a great value, if she decides to continue and shows talent and desire then I would invest in a better guitar, her teacher said the same, the product tunes and plays like a much more expensive piece, overall very happy, great first guitar
