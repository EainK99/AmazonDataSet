Works great on basic settings! Only has 2 colors of lasers, 95% green with 5% little red lasers. It has a strobe and a &#34;music reactive mode&#34; but they are kind of annoying and not sensitive enough unless you have some SUPER LOUD bass like acid/E rave style. But the normal slow fade mode is really cool, its kind of rough to get it on the slow fade, (it has a small dial control that seems to either super fast shift or stay still). But for the money this thing is awesome, I have a huge backyard and parties w/ friends like 3-5 days a week. So I just put it in the back window towards my trees in my backyard and it spreads to about 100x100foot coverage and looks cool, almost like a bunch of crazy fire flies are slowly dancing. Solid purchase! Good for fun decoraction at home, I suppose its a little basic for commercial dj operation, but not out of the question.
