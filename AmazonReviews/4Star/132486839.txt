Great sounding strings. Love the rich warm tone they deliver. However, you got to be careful how you &#34;tie&#34; the string to the tuning post, you might have some intonation issues with that string if you did it badly, (the package has some info on this). They last pretty long for me, up to 1 month maybe if you clean them regularly.
