The only down side to this nice sounding mini steel drum is the length of the mallets.  All the company needs to improve is to lengthen the mallets to make the 'drumming' easier on adult size hands.  I was very pleased with the stand also.  I thought it might be more of a 'toy' type, but I was wrong.....this is a great way to begin learning steel drum and with nice tone quality.
