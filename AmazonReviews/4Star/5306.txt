These bags will hold four American DJ, or Chauvet flat pars nicely, with all three padded partitions in place. However, if you're using the TSSS flat pars, you will only get three in to go in, if you use all the partitions. I order to get all four TSS flat par fixtures into the bag safely, you must remove two of the partitions, and place two TSSS flat pars in with the LED sides facing each other in each of the two bays formed by the one remaining center partitions. If you have a soft sheet of thin foam, or a rag, you can slip that between each pair of TSSS flat pars, to avoid scratching the cheap plastic they're maid of.<br /><br />On another note, if you're like me, and you're trying to keep load-in/out, and setup/teardown times down, you probably like to keep your truss hooks, or O-clamps attached to your fixtures' yokes (not called brackets). In this case, you will not be able to close the bag. You'd be lucky if you get one zipper half way along with the hooks, or O-clamps in place. Simplest solution is to use the bag's handles with the Velcro grip to secure the fixtures.<br /><br />There are some great youtube videos out there which show other types of fixtures going into these bags, such as scanners, moonflowers, spots, gobo projectors, ect. Definitely versatile.<br /><br />I was able to slip two of these into the bottom of a Stanly Work Chest, and I was still able to stow other items next to, and over them, so they don't take up too much space in your trunk.
