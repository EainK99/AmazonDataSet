I have gone through a lot of headphones in this price range. I bought these one day and haven't found anything that can compare.<br /><br />The Sound Quality: Like others have said, it's the best for the price range. I'm not in to the physics aspect of it; I just want to know if they sound good. These do. The trebles are clean and not buzzy, and the bass is clear and crisp, but not overbearing. I listen to a large variety of genres - pop, rock, electro-house, k-pop, classical, chiptune, dubstep, and others. They also sound consistently great.<br /><br />The Structural Quality: Sadly, I think Sennheiser has been progressively reducing the quality of these headphones. I've gone through four or five pairs in the past few years, but the time in between each purchase for me seems to be shorter. It is nice that the speakers pop out of the head brace, and the head brace is fine. No issues with that. But the part of the cord that exits the speaker has unraveled on me more than once. Granted, these do get a beating from me by being tossed and bounced around my backpack with heavy books. So it may just be an issue with me. But, nonetheless, having a sturdier cord would probably solve that problem. Maybe an ever-so-slightly increase in its thickness?<br /><br />The Comfort: Very comfortable, BUT: these make your ears HOT after only 20 or 30 minutes of use. 60+ minutes of continuous use of these and your ears will feel like they are cookies baking in an oven. So, they double as earmuffs too - if you live in a colder climate this should not be as much of an issue. I should also note that I have a HUGE head and BIG ears, and haven't had a problem with these fitting.<br /><br />The Other Notes: The cord length is crazy long - I wish there was a model available with a shorter cord for people who don't need the extra length. Each time I have purchased these they have come with a free 3.5mm to 1/4 inch adapter so you can plug your headphones into a 1/4 inch jack if needed (great for those that need it). It also comes with an oval-shaped chunk of plastic that you can wrap your cord around. I've never utilized that tool.<br /><br />Overall, these are great for the price. I would recommend this product, but would mention what I've written here in order to aid someone else's purchase.<br /><br />Blessings!those that need it).
