I was really into these strings for a long time before switching to a regular slinky. If you're looking for a lighter string though for easier playability, these work great. They hold up well, and that's not surprising considering they come from Ernie Ball. They are also very affordable and I would recommend them to any guitar player of any level who wants a little lighter of a string gauge.
