At the $50 price point I have to give these headphones a good review.  Even though they are far from \\"Professional Grade\\" as the name suggests, they are well built from hard plastic and the speakers have great bass response, decent midrange, and decent highs.  I prefer more dynamic range than these headphones can deliver, even after tampering with the equalization setting on the iPhone and iPad.  But for $50 I'll be using these when I travel and enjoying great sound on planes, trains, and automobiles.
