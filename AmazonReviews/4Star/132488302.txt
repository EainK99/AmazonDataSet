Okay, I bought these mics in March, used them a few times in rehearsal, they were fine. Had planned to use them at a lounge gig for our group. Unfortunately, I had some health issues and had to delay our performances for a few months. So finally we made our maiden voyage last weekend....only used 3 of the 4 mics -- they worked great!<br /><br />But...we will see....sure enough I dropped one as I was packing it up (the blue one) I will have to test it to see if it's damaged. Also, still need to test all 4 at once in performance, but with the 3 we used, they were clear (a lot has to do with the quality of the PA system you're running it through and the space you're trying to fill). For what we do, indoors in small areas (Coffee shops/Lounges/Restaurants,ect..) these are perfect.<br /><br />I was able to get a good EQ mix so the sound wasn't too low or too treble. Been using some pretty good Shure mics with cords, and honestly tired of all the cords, just set the mic receiver on top of my PA Mixer, 4 short XLR's into each...piece of cake...Peace of mind...just plug and play....so I have to say until I plug in again and find issues (especially with the blue colored mic which clumsy me dropped to a hard floor) I love these mics!
