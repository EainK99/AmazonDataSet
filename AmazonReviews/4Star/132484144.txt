I don't know why you would pay over 100 dollars for a laptop stand. This thing is as advertised...it holds your laptop. It has multiple settings depending on how high you would like your laptop. I have it about in the middle and it is very sturdy on my banquet table that I usually DJ on. There have been previous complaints about the lips in the front not being able to hold a Mac because of the rounded edges on the MacBooks. I don't see it as being a problem, as mine has stayed just fine. I do have a Speck cover on my laptop, so maybe that might have something to do with it. Overall, this is a great product for the price. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I can foresee the stick-on padding coming off pretty soon. Will probably need to glue it down every so often.
