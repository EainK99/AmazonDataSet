I'm a classical bassist and after reading some great informative reviews on this from other bassists, I decided I would purchase. In the past I used to use a wooden bar stool with padded seat I cut down to fit my seating height for playing while sitting in very long rehearsals, concerts, etc. I carried that darn stool everywhere with my bass so this seating needed to not only be height adjustable but also portable.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Adjustable height seating: essential since I am only 5'5&#34; but this also works for someone over 6'<br />Padded seat: helps ease the bum during long playing sessions<br />Back rest:  comes in handy during those long rests<br />Foot rests: always need a foot up so your knee can support the bass and give stability as you're playing to free up your left hand<br />FOLDABLE = PORTABLE. You can completely remove the back rest to make it a smaller profile either while playing or for portability. It also is a nice sturdy weight without being heavy- well built.<br />It also looks very professional and keeps a low profile where other stools specifically designed for bass players take up more floor space, are heavier and MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Back Rest: is a bit too far back to really put to good use. You have to lean far back. One more drilled hole to bring the back closer would have been perfect<br />Padded seat: While a well padded seat is essential to ease the pain on the bum in long practices, rehearsals, the seat is made of vinyl/leather which is not breathable therefore ensuring a sweaty bum! I will be getting an additional padded CLOTH covering to help.<br /><br />I gave this a 4-star for those cons from my experience. See images (ignore the stuff in the back. the bass is a crappy rental while I'm waiting for my newly purchased bass to arrive). Also the one I got had a bit of a nick in the leg from packaging although the packaging was well done.<br /><br />I hope this helps!!
