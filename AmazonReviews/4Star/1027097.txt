This pad helps to spread out the weight of my bass.  I just started playing bass about a month ago.  I practice for 2 to 3 hours a night and this was really starting to hurt my shoulder.  With this pad there is a lot of relief.  The pad is a little heavy though and ill not stay in place when adjusting my bass.  I have to keep sliding it back into place.  Also as others have stated I did not receive the picks with this; but, I did not buy this for the picks.
