This is a really good quality cable.  You can feel how well it's built and the silent plug is awesome- how have I not been using one of these before? The one (small) drawback to this cable is that there is a little play in between some of the layers, so it can be a little tricky to wind/unwind.  But no biggie, if you're not particular about that. Now I just need one with x2 straight plugs instead of one right end!
