This mixer is absolutely amazing. I will not go into detail because if you are really thinking about buying one of these, you have most likely used the DJM line before. BUT.. One thing I will say to Pioneer. The 6 FX are all great, but there should be some kind of adjustment curve for the FX amount for the color rotaries. The FX cut in too quickly. That is the only complaint I would have about this mixer. Great buy though. If you are serious about playing out, this is the mixer you will see in clubs.
