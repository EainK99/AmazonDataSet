I was surprised when I tried the Ernie Ball 4600 Super Locks, because these are very heavy, especially compared with Jim Dunlap guitar strap locks.  The Ernie Ball locks are also considerably more flamboyant than competitors' products.  These certainly are designed to be sturdy and definitely are also designed for quick release.  However, as you can probably guess from the photograph, they are anything but subtle.  The strap locks clearly work well, but in retrospect, they just shout a little too loudly for me.
