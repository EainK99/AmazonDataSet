This guitar is great for beginners or casual players. While it doesn't hold a tune for that long.....for the price, you cannot come close to beating it. The sound is warm, and the fretboard is smooth. Ive played for 20 years and got this to teach one of my kids, so far one of the best investments from Amazon so far. Came in perfect condition, I changed the strings upon arrival to a preferred brand, and started jamming. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is not a serious guitar player or is someone who wants to become a serious guitar player.
