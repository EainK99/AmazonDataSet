Strings didn't snap when I tuned it, even though they kept on tuning down for a short while. There's a minor chemical smell when opening the package, a very minor scratch, and some excess paint near the tuning screws. Since the guitar was so cheap, it also served as a good conversation piece before it was delivered. Minus 1 star for requiring guitar straps to be tie-on. Looks like a guitar, sounds like a guitar, feels like a guitar, not bad for what it is.
