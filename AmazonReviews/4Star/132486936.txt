The quality of this volume pedal is very good.  It is made of heavy duty aluminum I believe so it is built to last a long time.  The operation of it is very smooth and while I am still getting the hang of making a volume adjustment while playing it does exactly what I was looking for it to do.  Often I would find myself thinking that I was too loud or too soft and it was difficult to adjust my volume knob while keeping the rhythm going.  My only complaint is that this pedal is huge.  It is almost 12\\" front to back.  I built a pedal board and had left a space for it.  When I got it I was surprised how big it was (I was thinking it would be about the size of my Cry Baby pedal). I nearly returned it but instead was able to modify my board to fit it in.<br /><br />I would recommend this pedal but be aware of the size of it and maybe consider the Jr instead if space is an issue for you.
