Great hearphones. Thick and durable cord, three sizes of ear pieces and the best part: the music. Sound is really good and bass is deep, mids are punchy and highs are crisp. I listen to a variety of music from jazz to classic rock to hip hop and most everything in between. They shine on all fronts. Sound isolation is great. I've listened to these at 35,000 feet and had no issues. The only drawback I get is problems getting them to stay in when I run but the sound overrides that. I would recommend if you're not a snobby $800 hifi headphones type yet still want some great earphones for whatever.
