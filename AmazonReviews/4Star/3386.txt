I have the Tonor Microphone Boom Arm sitting in my man cave. For the price, it 'just works'. I do a lot of music production, but this is the first time I mounted a mic to my desk (I usually use traditional mic stands) so I can't comment on this VS. other more expensive options. So far, the quality has been good, the rotation and flexibility are also quite good. I imagine if you spent a little more, you'd get something that feels a little heavier/sturdier.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for an inexpensive mount for your Mic on your desk, I recommend this product.
