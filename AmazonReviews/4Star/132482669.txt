This is a medium gauge cable - which I use for connecting monitors on stage. It works perfectly, its durable enough to withstand normal wear and tear, and the price was excellent. The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars was that the cable could have been a little heavier gauge. Otherwise, this is perfect.
