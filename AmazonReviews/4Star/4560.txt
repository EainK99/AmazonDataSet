Was damaged (cosmetically) upon arrival.  Super thin bag - doubt it's going to hold up very well.  The screws and sharp edges of the legs scratched the finish off of the stands in several areas during shipping & tore the bag in a couple of areas.  Not worth returning as I suspect the same damage would happen anyway over time.  The stands seem to be of decent quality & should hold up fine.
