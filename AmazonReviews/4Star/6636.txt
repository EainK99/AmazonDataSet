So, I have the Blue Yeti microphone and at first i thought that the screw on part was too small for the blue yeti screw part... then i googled my issue and found this Youtube video that solved the problem perfectly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZCxtaqzvgA . The part in the little package has the adapter already screwed in, so you just have to twist it out yourself and attach it to the Blue Yeti or Blue Snowball and it'll attach to your stand!! That was the only issue I've had. So far, the stand is working great and I would definitely recommend this product :)
