very bright and they seem to last quite awhile on a charge... I use to have a battery style light that would last about a book to a book and a half before I had to replace the batteries.  I have read about the same amount and it hasn't even started to go dim.  I am using both lights but only on the low level for both.  The higher level seem to be to bright for my eyes but I have very sensitive eyes and bright lights hurt my eyes... I would recommend this light to others
