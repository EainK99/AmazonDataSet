The issue I'm having with this unit is the phantom power. I have the Rode NTG-2, which can run off of 48V phantom power, but when supplying phantom power to the mic, I get terrible unusable crackling and static.<br /><br />I'm assuming what's going on is it supplies a lower volts of phantom than I need, but I don't see the specs of how much power it provides anywhere. I know the issue isn't with the mic, as using other phantom power sources it sounds beautiful. This really sucks because I prefer no battery while booming, and I actually have experienced that the Rode NTG-2 seems to give about +12DB with phantom versus the battery, so I'd prefer to use it. I tried different batteries just to see and it was no help. Used a brand new duracell power lock 9v battery.<br /><br />Here's what I've observed:<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Good amount of gain, good SNR, works very well in conjunction with the zoom H4N or stand alone as a \\"run and gun\\" solution.<br />*Monitoring capability in the unit itself, good for run and gun to check for noise, but not a good indicator of quality at all (note: I thought the unit sucked while monitoring through the unit. It was only when I listened to the recorded output that I gained respect for the quality of it)<br />*USB sound interface works with PC and the ipad as I understand it... I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but am looking forward to doing so<br />*Using a 1/4\\" to 3.5mm cable or adapter, you can plug this unit into the \\"mic\\" jack of the zoom h4n, this allows 4 track recording of 1/4\\" or XLR connections, supurb!<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Phantom power isn't working for my Rode NTG-2 (requires 48v, maybe it's a 12 or 24v source, I wasn't able to find this out)<br />*When boosting the volume, there are 2 noticeable \\"steps\\" that occur near the high end of the gain knobs. These have been talked about in other reviews, be careful about these if you're using the unit to ride your levels during a recording.<br />*No mounting options, it would be super sweet if this guy had a tripod mount built in on the bottom<br />*The battery compartment is retarded, extremely difficult to get a battery in and out, and it never quite closes right. The battery door is threaded as well as the unit, so you have to tightly hold the battery door down while screwing the thumbscrew in or the battery door will be loose until you unscrew the thumbscrew completely.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />After thinking it through more, I think I will attempt to return the unit and see if I can get some decent quality out of the phantom power. Others don't seem to be having the same issue, but I also haven't heard of anyone else who has actually used the phantom power, they all seem to just say something like \\"oh, it's got phantom power too how awesome is that?\\"<br /><br />I'll go ahead and return it and let you know how the new unit performs, but I may miss the deadline as I must use it for a live event Sunday so I will be cutting my return policy close. I want to expand on a very important point in my original review too by the way:<br /><br />The headphone (3.5mm) port on the unit doesn't do it justice. At least not when I was monitoring from it using my headphones and was outputting to my H4N using the 1/4\\" outputs. I thought the output was noisy and unimpressive until I began monitoring from the H4n itself. Then is when I gained respect for this little guy. If you're getting poor results, consider trying the output of the 1/4\\" jacks. I'll do a full review update when I get the replacement with the full details of my discoveries (and confirmation of if the issues I found aren't just specific to my unit)<br /><br />*Update 12.13.13<br /><br />When I returned this unit I inadvertently spent the money we received as a refund without realizing it. I have yet to be able to afford a replacement. I hope to soon, but since I already have a zoom h4n this isn't a 'must-have'. I will surely purchase again someday soon, and when I do I will update this review as promised. Meanwhile, hope some other people can try out phantom power and see if it's functioning because quite frankly if the phantom power is totally worthless like it was in the unit I tried, it will have an impact on my decision to purchase this again.
