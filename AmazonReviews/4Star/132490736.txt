Pros<br />- Works as advertised<br />- Remote offers some pretty amazing control<br />- Easy to setup and easy enough to solder (if you want to cut the strip)<br />- Strip comes with adhesive backing<br /><br />Cons<br />- Huge power supply and IR Remote box get in the way for my purpose (TV Back lighting). Basically pulls at my LED Strip and has caused it to become detached from my TV. I ended up taping the IR box to the back of my TV to solve this problem<br />- Had a strip with some faulty LED's in them. Didn't show issues until about a week into use. There's enough extra LED Strip to replace the faulty section and it's not really an avoidable issue. These things do happen.<br />- Remote isn't the best as far as connectivity goes. It's been said in other reviews. A little annoying but still decent and the functionality of the remote does outweigh this one issue.<br /><br />Overall? Very satisfied. Basically, I was choosing between this item and the Ikea back lighting kit. They're both similarly priced but I do believe you get a bit more functionality out of the LEDwholesalers kit and it was a fun bit of project.
