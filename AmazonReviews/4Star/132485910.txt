My husband and I were thrilled with how easy and fun the Microky Duostar machine is to use! You can't beat how this machine is so simple to hook up without all the excess wires and mixers, speakers etc. I don't miss the old school machines. I remember doing karaoke at a friends house party years ago. She had so many things to hook up with wires everywhere. Also, you had to change cassettes and CDs.<br /><br />The Microky Duostar Portable Wireless with 5000 songs is so easy to hook up to your TV. The music is built in and you can buy extra song chips. There is a huge selection of songs to chose from and a very nice bag to put everything away after you're finished singing. The microphones and remote give you easy access to a menu of cool features. We found it so easy to figure it out the first night. There is even a male/female setting.<br /><br />You definitely need good quality speakers with your TV. I like using a woofer too. It makes a difference with volume, base and echo delay.<br /><br />Awesome product! I hope there will be more buying options in the future for the Microky song chips. It would also be nice if you can create your own selections to put on the song chips too.
