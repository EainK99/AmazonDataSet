I refuse to believe that Eden, one of the most notable bass amp manufactures in the world, forgot to put a little LED on this DI that lets you know when your signal is peaking out. Had I known that, I would of maybe thought twice about purchasing it. Because I live in an apartment, I have to practice with headphones. So I would always run my pre-amp into a Mackie VLZ-3 mixer then run my ipod and CD player into the mixer and practice along. And the first time I ran the WTDI into my mixer, I wasn't sure if the DI was peaking out, the channel on the mixer was peaking out, or the batteries on my bass were dying. It took me a minute to figure out that the DI was peaking out. Had it had an LED peak indicator, it would have saved me the trouble. So I've never used it at a gig for this reason.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in the Enhance control. It's a little too noisy for me and adds a loud buzz. The idea behind the Enhance is to raise the lows and highs and maybe scoop the mids, sort of like the Pre-shape Filter on the Markbass amps.<br /><br />Overall, it puts out a nice warm sound. What would really top it out was if it had a tube pre-amp. The one-knob compressor works like a charm. As for the EQ, I still have to play with the mid-shift switch and bass-boost to get the right tone I want. I'd been using SWR for so long that I already knew how I liked my EQ dialed in.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I plugged in my acoustic-electric Ovation classical guitar. I was impressed! The Eden box made my guitar sound great! The Enhance knob really cleaned up the overall signal. I wish I had a acoustic-electric bass to experiment with the Eden DI. Gotta go shop for one now.<br /><br />Now I don't know if this is true or not..... but I heard that Eden and SWR were started by the same guy. For years I only exclusively used SWR. I always went out of my way to get my hands on pre-Fender SWR gear. Honestly, I was more curious, if anything, of the tone I would get out of the Eden WTDI.And for the price, you can't really go bad. And believe it or not, after 20+ years of playing music, I've never owned Eden gear before.
