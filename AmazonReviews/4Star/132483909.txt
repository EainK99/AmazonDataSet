I have used several bassoon reed cases in the past, including ones I made myself, and think that this was still the most cost effective case I have purchased. It kept all of my reeds secure; there was no worry about them falling out if I opened up the case upside-down by mistake and they did not rattle around in the case once the lid was closed. For anybody concerned about ventilation, the pictures provided on Amazon do not make it readily apparent, but there is plenty of ventilation. At the back of the case, where the joint is, there is a large slit that runs almost the entire width of the case that provides ventilation. It's not large enough to cause concern about your reeds falling out or other objects damaging them, but it is large enough to see the bottom of your reeds. I have used this case for over a year now and have not had any trouble with my reeds growing mold. In fact, they've looked healthier than they have being stored in other, more expensive cases. My two biggest criticisms, though not deal breakers, were that this case does not hold more than five reeds and the reeds are spaced very closely together. Every time I put away my reeds, I have to be careful not to knock one against another. I would not recommend this case for anybody who does a lot of traveling or puts their case in precarious situations. The case is hard plastic and will adequately protect your reeds, however it's not as durable as a wooden case. My reeds never suffered any damage while I used this case, but I would not recommend this case if you need more heavy duty protection.
