We've had this SKB rack in use for about 2 years to house network equipment at a remote office.  We installed our equipment, made all the connections between them and shipped the case out to the site. Once the covers were removed, all we needed was the connection to a power source and the network provider and it was in production.  The case is well made with good slide latches that can be padlocked.  The only modification we made was to install 4 high quality wheels on one side for easy rolling.  SKB now has more industrial versions than this that have wheels.
