The item does what I needed to and I wanted it for, slightly bulkier and heavier than what I was expecting but<br />it is hard to appreciate the mass volume from a screen or for the written measures, this is actually a pretty<br />solid constructed stand, one of those items that you feel a bit concerned for hitting the furniture nearby cuz<br />it can damage it.  I didnt bought it for stage, I bought it for my home studio.<br /><br />I liked it because:<br />It does what I neeeded and it is solid constructed.<br /><br />I didnt like:<br />The stupid legs are so annoying, first of all they are weak for the solid construction of the actual stand, doesnt really fix as sturdy as I would have hoped for, second with the star shaped wheels and next to my desk, you can imagine how annoying is to hit my chair that has the same kind of base than the stand.  Due to these inconveniences, I ended up tossing the plastic base and wheels away,<br />since I will not be moving it around, it doesnt really affect me, I just fixed it with basic tools to one of the corners of my table<br />and works how I want, obviously I cannot move it tho, but again, I bought it more cuz of the holding portion than the mobility.<br /><br />I started in the hobby of putting a basic home studio, since last year, and one of the devices I have is &#34;Maschine&#34;,<br />the holding stand is too wide for maschine, the stand is originally designed for a mixer so I cannot say it is defective, it is only<br />FYI, since it is built a bit too big for N.I maschine.  A smaller version of it would be ideal to co-exist with this one for home setups, after realizing there was a considerable gap at the sides of maschine, I tried a recently acquired Akai controller and works perfect, it actually gives my setup a nice touch as the controller looks pretty cool in the stand.  So the device I originally got it for didnt work very well, but still happy with the purchase as it fits my Akai controller instead.<br /><br />There is one thing I didnt like very much tho (aside from the wheels), one of the sides of the holding stand came in slightly bent to the inside.  Doesnt affect very much the way it holds my controller, but still you can see that it is bent and also it slightly make the fit at the edge uneven. It is minimal, meaning no biggie, but still in there.
