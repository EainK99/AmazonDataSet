I'm not sure how it works, EQ, capacitive reactance inductance or whatever, but the reactance control does give a good tube amp sound and feel. A little sag and compression, a little less sharp attack. It ain't a tube amp but it works great with my Boss modeling preamp and Celestion speakers, very tube like, much less sterile than the Carvin and EV SS power amps I was using. It's not a flat response PA or studio amp, it does color the sound but in a way that suits guitar. Plus it only takes one rack space, the ins and outs are super simple, the price is OK and it's plenty loud. The cooling fan is kind of obnoxious but if the amp is being pushed enough for it to come on you're not going to hear it anyway. The down side is it's heavy, the definition control is a 6.5K or so boost which is kind of harsh, I barely use it. The reactance control adds bass, you have to EQ around that. Don't buy this if you want uncolored sound, a fast attack and tons of headroom. This thing has a tube rectifier sound on purpose. If you like old tube amps but don't want to deal with their problems, buy it. It's good for rock, R&B, blues and country. Performed well at a long, hot gig. What works for me may not work for you but I'm a gigging musician, have played for years and I'm impressed with this amp.  4.5 stars.
