It seems that Amazon sells this same product as four or five different 'items', and perhaps should list them as additional \\"buying choices\\" under one 'Product'. My stand light arrived with one LED extremely dim (compared to the others), I am getting only 89% of the light intensity which I SHOULD be getting. But it's good enough. I took off 1 star for this \\"QA\\" problem.<br /><br />Best advantage? The flexible arm stays in the shape you bend it, allowing you to focus the light pattern across the entire page much better than the traditional manhasset florescent. That old-style lamp tilts, but can't be bent to point at the music pages from a more \\"forward\\" location, and can't be adjusted for height. The brightness at the bottom of the page is very low with the old-style manhasset. For a large ensemble, Manhasset also requires a jungle of extension cords across the stage platform. (Time is money, in having that Stage set up by professional Techs or stage hands.) With these LED lamps running on batteries, these lamps often qualify as \\"musician's accessories\\", rather than \\"stage equipment\\". When that is the case, musicians themselves can often grab them from a box when checking their seating arrangement -  without breaking any rules. And no cords to tape down -even if they must be clamped on to the stands by stage hands, less time is required. This is WAY better, both individually and with larger ensembles.<br /><br />Battery life seems to be BETTER than they advise- but that may be a side effect of running with one less LED than I should have received.
