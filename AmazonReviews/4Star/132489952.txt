These strings have been my \\"go to\\" strings for more than a year now. I first bought them on a lark because I liked the pin-up girl packaging and was curious what such a rock bottom price would mean for string quality. I was more than pleasantly surprised. These strings offer a really open, clean sound that's just what I like. If you're into shredding, these probably won't do what you want. These strings are ideal for vintage tones--country, blues, and old-school rock. I think it's actually because they're so cheap. I don't have the electronic meters and doodads to test them with, but I'm assuming they offer a weaker source for your pickups and so mellow out your pickups and allow some breathing room in the signal.<br /><br />The only reason these aren't 5-star is that they leave a residue on your fingers for the first few hours of play. I don't know what that residue is, whether it's just nickel dust wearing off from them or some sort of preservative or oil Everly uses in the factory. But your fingers turn a slight metallic blue. The residue washes off easily--but it is kind of off-putting.
