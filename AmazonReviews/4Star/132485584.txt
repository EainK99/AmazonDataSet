Once the strings are tuned, this child's guitar really does have a surprisingly good sound.  Our 18 month old can't yet hold it properly, but he loves to lay it on the floor and strum the strings.  The relatively low price and reasonable sturdiness, mean that I can have him play it and not have to worry about the fact that he doesn't entirely understand \\"gentle\\" yet.  It really releases him to explore his musicality without me having to stress over breaking the instrument.  This alone is worth purchasing!
