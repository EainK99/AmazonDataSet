Overall I really love this bubble machine. It makes a lot of bubbles and works as described. Just pour the bubble solution and turn it on!<br /><br />What I did not like about the bubble machine is that the bubble tray is made out of really flimsy plastic- I'm worried it wont last long. But I've only had it for a couple of weeks now. I think it should be ok as long as I keep the kids away from the bubble solution tray. The kids love all the bubbles I let it run on the back patio while they play.
