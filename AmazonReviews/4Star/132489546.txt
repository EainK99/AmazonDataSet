This category of lighting is moving and changing SO FAST it is hard to invest any money without knowing what your 2 year plan is. This did exactly as promoted, no complaints. You can use this for localized applications such as up lighting but don't expect it to make an impression when trying to light a large area. I think all of my future lighting investments will be for smaller WIRELESS lights. Why smaller? I'd rather have 8 small lights than 1 or 2 large ones, but keep in mind; 'QUALITY over QUANTITY'. And I want wireless for obvious reasons as the setup time is greatly reduced. DJ Don
