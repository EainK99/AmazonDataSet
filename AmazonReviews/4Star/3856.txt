OK, so I wanted to wait till I had gotten some time up on the board before posting my review on this controller. I bought mine refurbished, BUT there wasn't even so much as a finger print on the controller, and everything works great.<br /><br />Packaging was, as expected, more then adequate to protect the controller, all contents that should be in the box, was. The controller itself, lets just say the pics on here really don't do any justice for what the controller looks like when powered on. All kinds of different colored lights on this board, all color coordinated to make identifying in low to no light a lot easier ... In fact, I stopped using my USB LED Laptop light to light up my old board.<br /><br /> Now the important stuff, first I'm going to say that this bad boy is 2feet long and probably a good 15+Lbs, depending on the location of where your going to be putting this controller, and more importantly what its going to sit on. Table/coffin/case you'll be fine, but if you use one of the laptop/mixer stands, you might want to check w its manufacturer to see what weight limit is.<br /><br />Sound quality: folks, Im an audiophile, not only passionate about music but the quality in the sound. I'm also MECP certified, installing high end audio/video and navigation systems on multi-million dollar yatchs ... When American Audio said they put a studio quality sound card into the VMS4.1, they were not joking around, by any means!! As soon as I powered up the unit and threw on a track, the sound that came out was just pure clean music. I could bore you with all the specks they don't show you here, but trust me when I say I was actually surprised by this unit. Strong bass, tight mids with clear highs.<br /><br /> The units features are more then ample, definitely can do a LOT with this board. The jogwheels are so smooth in terms of working them, the stars on the side are actually cut out from the side of the jogwheels, its not a sticker or paint and offers a really goodfeel when handling the jogwheels.<br /><br />While there's a lot of good things to say about this controller, I did find a couple of cons to the VMS4.1. For starters, as I mentioned, the size and weight, can be an issue if your using a weaker stand, or if your a mobile DJ ... Can see this getting heavy fast by the end of the day, especially if you have it in a case. While the jogwheels feel great by the stars and movement of the wheel, the actual pad on TOP, where most of your fingers would go ... There's black rubber pad shown in pics, its not a soft rubber pad, but more of a harder plastic, say etched by sandblasting for SOME grip, but I noticed when scratching, fingers would slowly slide across the surface of this pad.<br /><br /> Last con, but certainly not least by any means ... while the actual physical installation maybe takes 10 minutes, its the software setup, more specifically the audio configurations that's beyond frustrating. I spent 18 days researching out how to get all 4 decks to fade properly AND have prelisten. So you know, American Audio says 3n4 decks are live decks and can't be crossfaded, there is a way, you need to go to Virtual DJ's website, go to forums, search for vms4.1 setup. Not sure about traktor or serato<br /><br /> Would I recommend to a friend? I did :), he got on my deck for couple hours and he's now buying one himself :). Oh ... did I mention my boy's a DJ and that he's been doing it since the late 70's? So yeah, 2 pro's say go, go ahead an buy this, while you still can ;)
