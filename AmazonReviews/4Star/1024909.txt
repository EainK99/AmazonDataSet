This mic works really well.  Good recording sound.  The built-in headphone jack is a really nice feature.<br /><br />I but one small issue:  The ball joint connecting the mic to the clip is a bit loose.  It takes very careful placement to get it to stay where I want it, and even a minor vibration could cause it to shift position. This is a minor issue now, but I am concerned that it could become more pronounced as I use it more.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a fine mic.
