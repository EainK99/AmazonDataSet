This is not a professional Gita, but it is a nice looking one at 1/3 the price of a pro model.  I collect world percussion instruments and look for good, but not the best, quality.  This fits that description.  It looks nice, but don't expect the same design as in the photo.  Mine has an elephant carved on the bottom.  It sounds pretty good, too.  The gita is not an easy instrument to play, and there is not much information available on how to play it.  Search YouTube for \\"Nimbaya Harvard 2012\\" to see a a Guinean women's percussion ensemble playing Krin and Gita.  Another good reason to buy this instrument... it benefits the Africa Heartwood Project.
