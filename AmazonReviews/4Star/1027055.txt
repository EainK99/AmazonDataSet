The item received arrived in trapezoidal paper box.  The content of the box include hex wrench for the neck adjustment.<br />The neck after using for about 6 month has developed a slight twist, almost unnoticeable, but it is there.  It twist cannot be correct via hex wrench.  The item is made not in US any more.  Comparing to the old AA21 made in US that I have the unit is slightly larger.  I could not fit the &#34;new&#34; guitar into old AA21 hard case, the size are noticeable different.  Looking at the craftsmanship, the new guitar from Indonesia seems to be bit less in quality.  But, none the less, it is very affordable guitar for the beginning to use.  The action is very good, the tuners are good and stays in tune.  But, as far as it's durability, only time will tell.  Over all good value of money.
