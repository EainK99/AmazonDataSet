Sounds Great, and has Great quality but where the heck is the Chargers??? What a let down. Please resolve the problem for future buyers. I mean seriously, It's a amazing portable speaker but where's the charger, and the &#34;Voltage Selector&#34;? There's no Charger in the box and there's no Switch on the back of the speaker to switch from 110V to 220V.
