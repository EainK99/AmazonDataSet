Really nice keyboard and speaker system (give the product itself 5 stars). Took 4 weeks to get here from Japan. Mine was packaged well, but did not get a tracking number till I emailed them the third week. Manuals in Japanese, but English is available online. I am not sure how hard it would be to repaired if anything was wrong with it...Saved about $100 buying it from Japan though, and bought the nice stand with the money. (gave 4 star rating due to shipping and warranty concerns)
