purchased for my daughter who is relatively new to piano but very dedicated to her lessons.  It is not too loud - love the volume control,  need to get some head phone that fit it (you need real sound headphones - the little ones you hook up to your ipod or computer do not fit).  the quality of the sound is nice.  none of the problems others mentioned.  all keys work and love practicing with the weighted keys rather than a low end keyboard.
