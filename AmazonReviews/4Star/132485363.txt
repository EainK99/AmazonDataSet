This is the first ukulele I ever bought or played. I had a gift-card so I was able to get it for free - and this was the highest rated ukulele for my price range.<br /><br />Being as this is the first ukulele I had ever played, I wasn't really sure what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth and harmonious tone of the instrument. It's a great instrument for beginners due to the size and affordability.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I have to tune this ukulele quite often - almost every day when I play it regularly. Other than that it is well built, sounds great, and is extremely fun and easy to play!
