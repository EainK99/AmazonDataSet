While I am not expecting these headphones to last ore than a few years,I have to say that I was more than pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of these headphones. I concur with other reviewers that the sound on these headphones easily beats out those costing much, much more. The build quality is somewhat lacking, but that was forgiven as soon as I plugged them in. I believe there there was an audible &#34;wow!&#34;<br />For the price, these headphones are most definitely worth buying, and I plan on snapping up a few more sets for my home recording studio.
