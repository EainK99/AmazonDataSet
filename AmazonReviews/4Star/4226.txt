I got this about a couple months ago and it was what I expected. Minor scratches on the finish but nothing too serious it still looked just like the image. The only issue I had with this was that the wiring and pickup were in a sense broken. I tried playing it several times and it was not connecting to my amp. Because I had the issue I emailed the seller and I was sent a new plugin for the amp. At the time I had not gotten it diagnose but the company sent it rather quickly and gave me an extra set of picks as well as the new plugin for free. Now I have 2 with a good amp. After taking it to guitar center I got the pickup fixed so now I am a proud owner of a Jameson guitar with a LesPaul pickup.
