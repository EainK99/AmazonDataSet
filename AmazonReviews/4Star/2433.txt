My foray into vinyl started quite modestly; my mother gave me one of those &#34;four in one&#34; wooden Crosley players that had a record player on top. From there I began collecting, and I decided to upgrade to something that took up less real estate on my dresser top and sounded better. I bought the Ion as opposed to one of the many Crosley options and I'm pleased with it. The speakers are small, but the fidelity is quite good and not tinny which I somewhat expected. The added usb connectivity isn't what I bought it for but if you plan on converting your collection it should suffice well enough. At time of review I've had and used this player for around a month and I'm happy with it. The volume isn't an issue despite the speaker size and the quality of playback is better than my old Crosley which is all I could ask for. If you're looking for top notch quality sound this likely isn't for you. But as someone who isn't willing to break the bank for barely negligible audio quality, this player suits my needs, and likely anyone else starting out listening to vinyl as a hobby.
