I like this instrument. I have to learn how to play it.  I like the sound, and because I am a senior citizen I found it heavy to hold at first, but I purchased a brass sling to hold it while playing the horn.  The mute works well, and I am less likely to annoy my wife as I settle in for a practice session. I like my purchases, and I am sure I'll get a lot of use out of them
