These tenor mallets are what my band's drum line decided to use. They are incredibly durable. That can not be expressed enough. There was a pair of these before that laster 4 years before they broke.  They also have a very light feel so moving around is incredibly comfortable. Do to the shade and hardness of the head's, they rebound really nice and again, feel comfortable going around the drums. However, the reason I give this a 4 and not a 5 is their in-ability to do rim-shots. If u look at the head, it's a cart wheel shape. So u can't actually hit the rim with the physical stick (the part that isn't the head) while wearing a harness. The grips do like to slide off but a dab of glue or even putting tape under it is just enough to prevent that. So you may need to keep a pair of extra sticks to do clicks with if you need to.
