This light does exactly what it says - works quite well. Also, I was a bit concerned as to whether it would flicker in regards to video - but it did not. White works quite well  - nice and bright - adding the other colors was just a great way to add some additional color to the situation.<br /><br />My scenario is to use this in our Church sanctuary - bought it primary for the white - but it works well. Our scenario was DMX control - which works just splendidly.
