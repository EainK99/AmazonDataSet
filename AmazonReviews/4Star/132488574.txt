I think this will be a fine mouthpiece for the French horn case we have (the mouthpieces are always falling out of the built-in mouthpiece holes).  Since the loaner instrument from the school is thoroughly thrashed and from 1959, it is no biggie--but if I were to buy a newer instrument, I'd wish this didn't have a zipper.  It's a lightweight plastic-ish zipper pull and tag, but still, it would do a great job scratching up your instrument's lacquer...in my opinion.  The fabric is soft, however, yet I would have preferred more foam to project the bore/shank of the mouthpiece if it were dropped.  Ultimately it is a dependable pouch, from what I can see.  Those of you who have the rare hard shell horn cases will be wishing, however, for a separated storage area (a trait which is rare in the generic case you usually get).
