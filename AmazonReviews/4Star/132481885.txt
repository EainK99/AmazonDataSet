Is it the perfect capo? I'm not sure yet. I got it just to be handy, and it works with the one guitar I've tried it on so far. This guitar has a wider neck almost like a classical guitar, but is steel stringed and has a slightly curved fingerboard. Kind of like a Martin 00-18, if there is such a thing. The capo works very well on it. Fast, easy, and it practically falls into just the right amount of pressure to fret all the strings with no fret buzzing or bending the strings out of tune.<br /><br />The reservations I have about it are twofold. One, will it work on fingerboards that are flat or more curved than what I have? Maybe. It has been designed for differences in string gauges from low to high, so that's in it's favor, but I can't say for sure yet if it will perform on all kinds of fretboards equally well. Two, will the velcro type closure last very long? It seems to be a light-duty style of velcro, so I get the feeling that the closure will be the first thing to fatigue. As an occasional use or backup item it works great, but I can't consider it a tireless or universal capo yet. Time will tell. I am glad I got it though, it's shown itself to do the job I got it for, and it's proven worthwhile already.
