I've had mine for a few days now, and I like it so much I just ordered a second one to hack on.<br /><br />As a device to learn how to play the guitar, it's of questionable value.  Even if you already play the guitar, this thing takes a while to adjust to -- the only thing in common with a guitar is the chord shapes you \\"fret\\" with.  However, it does come with a voucher that allows you to download a pack of 10 songs, and those songs will light up the fretboard as they play.  That gives you a shortcut to figuring out the chords (tab would be better), and there is a feature to slow down the songs to make playing along easier as you learn the songs.<br /><br />The All-star app is nicely done.  However, where this toy really shines is as a midi controller for Garage Band and the like.  There is very little latency.<br /><br />There are a couple of misfeatures that keep this thing in the toy realm: no outputs (either analog or digital), no inputs (a way to charge the iPad while docked would be nice), and the neck is way too flimsy -- it twists as you play.<br /><br />So I bought a second one to see if I can address some of these issues.  It shouldn't be too hard to either stiffen the neck or make a new neck, and others have already added a sound-out port to theirs.<br /><br />I doubt we'll ever see a device this cool and this cheap again.  Stock up.  Maybe they'll become collectible one day, like the kitara.
