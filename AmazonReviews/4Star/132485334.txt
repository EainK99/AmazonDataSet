First, I've noticed that many reviews here are for the \\"original\\" NS tuner, the one with only two buttons and \\"coin slot\\" battery cover. This one is a little smaller, has a metronome flasher, and the battery installs differently, but the name/model evidently didn't change.  I compared this new one, the \\"original\\", and the latest Snark on dreadnought guitar, mandolin, and 5-string banjo.<br /><br />Pros: Size, size, and SIZE!!<br />  Reasonably accurate<br />  Mounting clip better than before<br />  Good price<br />  Metronome flasher maybe for some?<br /><br />Cons:  Display not as bright as others<br />  Contrary to their description, this one seems less sensitive than original.<br />  Battery compartment difficult to open<br />  May not fit well on some headstocks. On my wife's A style mandolin it fits but barely. On my slothead guitar it also<br />  barely fits.  That being said, I haven't found anything I can't use it on.<br /><br />My take.... The Snark was the better of the three in terms of accuracy, lock in speed, and visibility however I really dislike the \\"eyeball on a stick\\" form factor and refuse to use it on stage!  I like the fact that the NS is unobtrusive and can be left on the instrument, I even in leave 'em on in the case. The display and lock in speed of the original NS was better than the new one but the new one seems a bit more accurate for me. I'll keep the new NS tuners for now and hope that D'Adarrio (or someone) improves on it with a better processor and LED.
