I am so glad that shire offers these.  I replaced my Shures with B&Ws a year back, the plug on the B&Ws bent and essentially they wanted what it would cost for a new set to fix it.  So, I got the Shure e215.  Of course, as luck would have it, I bent the plug on the Shures after 45 days.  I was happen to find out I can order the cord so I didn't have to replace the complete headphones.<br /><br />When I got the cord, it was very easier to change and they worked right away.  I am really glad Shure has designed their headphones so the cord can be replaced.
