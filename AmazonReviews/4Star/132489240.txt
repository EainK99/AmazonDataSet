I bought this based on another Amazon review that said it would work on the Alesis Sample pad, it does (the Sample Pad comes with the mounting screws already in place).<br /><br />It arrived on time and the seller did a nice job packing it. I only gave it four stars because it's expensive and it's all plastic. IMHO this should be about $10 and they'd still be making a lot of profit, the cost to manufacture this is about 9-cents in china but it's supply and demand and I needed it.<br /><br />My Sample Pad is attached to our studio drum rack and it feels very secure, that's what matters.<br /><br />Good luck and good music to all
