I bought this for my daughter who is 11. The cds that come with it are a waste in regards to today's music. Be sure to purchase additional cds. At first it seems pretty complicated to use, but I'm a direction reader so it wasn't too bad. Yes there is humming, but it isn't a big deal. This does our needs perfectly. The sound is excellent as far as I'm concerned.
