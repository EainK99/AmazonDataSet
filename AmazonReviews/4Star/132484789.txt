When I first saw the Fender Rumble 30 at its listed price, I jumped on it - and I'm glad I did. I have a 53-watt guitar amp, and a 75-watt bass amp. I bought this one because I needed something smaller that I could play at lower volume (at home) without losing the authority in the bass's tone. It is plenty loud for a home or party environment. The dynamics of the amp give me any sound I want, and the AUX IN jacks are a nice touch. Perfect for entertaining myself or working up new song. I recommend this amp for anyone who has a bass guitar - beginner or pro. You can't get this sound for this price with any other amp.
