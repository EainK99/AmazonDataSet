The blue yeti delivers clear and fantastic voice production. One difficulty I have is that it's hard to have the right gain volume on the mic, since during most of my recordings I can hear the sound of my keyboard and my mouse. I suggest buying a little surround box of which you place the mic inside to get greater audio. Overall, excellent mic for you tubers.
