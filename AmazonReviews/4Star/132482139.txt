If you are the only one using this mixer, it's excellent. It has the most input options with the most amount of faders I've been able to find for it's size (and i maintain sound systems at several venues and have bought a half dozen of the C3s, C3USBs, etc) to accommodate many many inputs (2 cds, 2 turntables, 2 Serato channels, 2 guest inputs, 2 ipod inputs, 2 mics... it's all there, at the same time.<br />and it all works. Sonically it's fine. It's not a big deal as most DJs play MP3-quality audio anyway (pffft!).<br />The problem is when it gets over-used or abused by multiple DJs (or one abusive DJ). it wears down very easily, hence the Numark name and the price.<br />the crossfader stops working, the headphone jack, cue slider, in/out jacks, volume pots, faders, etc, all wear out easily, get dirty easily, or just plain stop working.<br />Replacement plans are great for it if you can go a month without needing your mixer or if you have a spare to use as a backup. But if you need to have it working all the time, buy 2.
