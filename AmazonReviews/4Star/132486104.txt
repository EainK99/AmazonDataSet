I conduct training sessions frequently where I am demonstrating technology and this microphone does the job quite well.<br />It records my voice from a distance of about 2 feet away and picks up most audience questions from within the conference room (oblong table).<br />The only problem i have is when my internal microphone takes precedence when I start a recording sometimes.
