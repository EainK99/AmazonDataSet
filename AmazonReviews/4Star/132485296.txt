Bought this item based on the reviews of the twin mike system. I used PreZoom to get the set back to New Zealand and it got through in 8 days of the supplier getting the package to the New Jersey depot well within their estimated time frame without any problem. The receiver is well constructed and was surprisingly heavy. The overall weight with 4x mikes and supplied AA batteries and power unit is 4.3 kg. The instructions are in Chinese english so it took sometime to work out how to use. I set the volume on the receiver to 80 but learnt that 0 is the loudest setting. The sound quality is very good however being dynamic rather than omni directional requires the mike to be close to the user. It will be important that if using a mike stand, the height will need to be set well for the user although if using a power mixer the high gain filter will improve sensitivity. I'm using a Leem LFX10 250 watt powered amplifier mixing board and the volume and sound quality of the mike system was very good through a pair of 200 watt passive speakers. In full configuration the power amp controls a pair of 800 watt active speakers with the 200 watt passives. I anticipate that the mikes will perform very well and I get to do a full operational run this weekend. The frequency per channel is preset and meets the forthcoming Digital Divide rules for NZ Government from 1 January 2014. I'm not sure how robust the plastic housing of the mike is going to be over time but it only reflects the price. I intend to update this review if there are any cons to report but on first impressions am very pleased with the purchase and the effort to get it here some 14,000 kilometres distance to home.
