I would rate this high for being a &#34;polite&#34; group session bodhran.  It looks nice and has a &#34;tight&#34; factory type construction.  But I think many people will have the urge to deepen the sound to get some real bass sound out of it.  I would caution people about dampening the drum head more than lightly as too much dampening can lead to weakening the drum head leading to holes and cuts in the head.  That might mean having to buy and remount a new head. Keeping this bodhran in a cool place between use is a safer way to get a lower tone.  If you wish to dampen the head, do it to the backside of the drum head inside the drum with a lightly dampened wash cloth.  The 14 inch diameter works fine with the modern top down type playing while holding the tipper somewhat like a pencil or pen.  If you are playing the old style &#34;triplets&#34; with both ends of the tipper 14 inches is a little tight.  Everyone needs to be careful with the typical wood tippers or the type of tipper made from bunches of wood dowels as they can damage the taping around the drum head.  I have used foam rubber pencil grips whole or cut in half on the end of tippers for  eliminating damage to the tape and achieving more of a musical note being played than just percussion.  You can use your non tipper hand on the backside of the drum head to move the sound up and down with a backslide technique.  You can also use wood or other rounded types of objects as a backslide tool.. The idea is to play just above or below the backslide pressure to raise or lower the tone. This increases the resonance.  I would strongly recommend Meinl expanding the line and coming out with a 38 or 40 cm diameter bodhran in the same model style for people that want more of a full bass and more aggressive playing than just for the usual public sessions.  I have a 40 cm bodhran from another leading German company and it adds a new dimension to playing to be able to access a real deep resonant bass sound.
