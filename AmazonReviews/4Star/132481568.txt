Just bought this. Seems durable and built well. Would prefer a little more padding in the main pouch but you get what you pay for and that might be expecting top much at this price point...<br />Certainly adequate for basic transport and protection.<br />I love the small cymbal pouch and stick bag pouch on each side. That's a nice touch.<br />I will say my 24 K fits but barely fits. There's no extra room at all. This makes me nervous a little as there's no real protection for the edge since it's right up to the zipper.<br />All in all, I am satisfied with this as it will suit my needs just fine, but if you need something with a little more protection, buy a case or more padded bag.
