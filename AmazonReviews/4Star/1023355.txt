For the money this is not a bad instrument.  Just keep in mind that it needs to be setup by someone that knows what they're doing.  Mine needed the neck adjusted, head tightened and tuned and the bridge positioned.  It also had a couple of loose frets and most of the frets needed leveling.  Lose the factory strings immediately.  If you're willing to spend the extra money this is a fun instrument.  If not you're probably not going to be satisfied with it's performance.  You also may very well want to get the model with a factory installed pickup.  You'll end up wanting one and adding one is a pain.
