This banjo was listed with all of the left handed banjos & comes right up when you search &#34;left handed banjos&#34; in search bar. It's NOT left handed & the left handed model is far more expensive. I can't understand why they would charge so much more for the left handed model, when it's the exact thing, just with everything on opposite side. So please don't make the same mistake as I did & order this thinking it's left handed, because it's not. It says so in description, but I didn't read the description because, we'll is a banjo. On the plus side, this is a great banjo for the money (if you need right handed) it plays great, had great sound.  Amazon was very quick about refunding my money as well, which was greatly appreciated.  They made the return process very easy.
