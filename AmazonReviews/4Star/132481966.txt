I bought this guitar a few months ago and I really enjoy it.  I've owned a 410ce, 316ce, 412ce, GS Mini and the 514ce ltd is my latest.  I'm keeping this one and the GS Mini for my beater.  It has a spruce top with koa back and sides.  It's not a terribly bass heavy guitar, but after playing it often and using a Tonerite on it for a week, the bass has gotten a bit louder, but the sustain much more so.  I know this guitar isn't all koa, but guitars with koa have a reputation for sounding a little tight, so it has already changed a lot.  Anytime you have a koa guitar, give it time.  I would definitely recommend you try playing it before you buy it.<br /><br />As with nearly all Taylors, action was low and intonation was great.  Koa wood (and guitars in general) aren't getting any cheaper, so if you're considering it, save up your money quick and give it a purchase.<br /><br />PS, if you're a really heavy strummer and want more bass, there is a 316ce Grand Symphony limited model of this same guitar on this site.
