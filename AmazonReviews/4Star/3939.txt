For a cheap sax, it is pretty darned fun.  I am looking forward to getting it to my son for Christmas.  It has something off with the low C key, but I think it just isn't sealing well, easy fix.  Otherwise, plays nice, has a decent sound, definitely not a professional sax, but a great sax to get started on.
