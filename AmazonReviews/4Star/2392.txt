I use this bench for my very small 5 year old to play the keyboard.  We have been able to adjust it up high enough for him, but his feet don't hit the floor.  We were using a kitchen chair, this is a vast improvement.  He has tipped it over once getting off, but now he is just more careful.  I'm sure it would also be a good bench for adults. The only downside is that it's vinyl, and after a while you kind of stick to it.  It's pretty easy to just put a towel down though.
