I started playing again after many years off. I tried this ligature and hated it at first. I found I needed to set an old reed on and leave it between practice sessions. the cap was hard to get on until it broke in too. that took around 3 weeks.<br />I think its an OK ligature but I find it somewhat hard to see the full reed placement since it's covered by the material.
