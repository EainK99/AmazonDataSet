I like to dictate the first version of my novels using Dragon Naturally Speaking by Nuance. The combination headset/microphone that I got with the program had a tendency to miss words and so I started looking around for a better microphone. After trying a few cheap desk top types I decided I would do it right and ordered the CAD U3 in the USB version. I also am a musician and wanted the ability to record. This microphone has fit the bill on both counts. I also got a boom mic stand so I can avoid having another item sitting on the desk as well as being able to use it with various instruments or on stage.<br />It is both sensitive and responsive enough for my broadcast and singing voice as well as my instruments. It is not a Shure57 or a 2020 but for the price and performance it is a great unit to start with. I have put  a &#34;pop&#34; screen on my wish list, though I haven't had a big problem.
