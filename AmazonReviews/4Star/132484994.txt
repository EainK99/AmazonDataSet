I have had to rethink my original review. I am still a little angry that when I ordered mine the fact it was shipping from overseas was obscured. That deception seems to have changed now, and at least one US store is also selling them. Theoretically, I have no problem with overseas shipment if it is clearly stated.<br /><br />Past angst aside, so far, I have used this pickup attached by blue painter's tape on the head INSIDE a banjo and on the top (OUTSIDE) of a mandolin. The sound this pickup produces is sensitive and clear. It responds like a microphone, and it does not need a preamp or phantom power to boost it. Just plug it in with a typical guitar 1/4 inch cable and go direct to the amp or board. I have used the pickup onstage through several different amps and PA's. It is always good once you get the sound guy to adjust the mid and bass levels.<br /><br />The build of the pickup is okay, maybe not \\"high quality,\\" but the sound definitely is \\"high quality.\\" The butterfly paper clip pictured literally ships with the pickup as some sort of wire tie, I guess, because there are no real instructions in English, only Chinese. (I thought the clip was pictured to show size, but it has some other esoteric function.) I did not use the Velcro tape. I prefer to attach the jack using blue painter's tape so I can remove it, but a well-place wire tie, at least on a banjo, could work too.<br /><br />This is an external pickup. No hole has to be drilled in your instrument. The pickup is not built in anyway to be mounted like that. The jack is sealed in plastic. The main issue is how you plan to stably mount the pickup. Whichever way you choose, you will not be disappointed with the sound.
