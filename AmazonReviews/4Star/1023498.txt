Has all the features of the name brand device at $20 less.<br /><br />Some things I've noticed.<br />The battery is difficult to insert, there isn't alot of extra space in the compartment. I do not look forward to replacing the battery.<br /><br />Also the USB cable tester seems useless, as both sides are the same connection. But with so many different styles of USB cable, and low price, I don't ever see myself needing to test USB.<br /><br />It would be nice if the RJ45 tested continuity over the shield.
