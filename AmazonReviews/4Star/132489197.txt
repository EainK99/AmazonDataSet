These are not the same as stock Tele knobs. They have a more domed head, slightly smaller and the knurl pattern is different. If you replace all your knobs with these then you will be fine. Also these are for split shaft pots, not smooth shafts. You cannot use these with a smooth shaft pot unless you melt the opening bigger. Too big and they are useless. You can usually get away with using your smooth shaft pot knob with a split shaft pot. If you put in a split shaft pot and are using these they will not match your smooth shaft pot knob. They are close, but not quite. Depends on how finicky you are, I suppose. I used it on a rotory pot I later installed in the pickguard so as looks more stock. It looks decent enough as it is far enough away from the others to look good as a stand alone knob.
