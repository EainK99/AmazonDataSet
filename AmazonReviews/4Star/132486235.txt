The caps were the solution to make the whackers sound a bit clearer and avoid to get them easily broken because I told my kids to hit them to the floor with the caps on and that prevents them from breaking.Not only that, the caps I don´t know why gave a better sound pitch, so now I can listen to them clearer.So if you didn´t like completely the whackers as I did in my review, maybe the caps will help to make them sound better so I would definitely recommend them
