Bought two of these at the same time. They have a nice long cord (about 20'), which is good for use with a camcorder. Well packaged. Unfortunately, one failed right away when I first tried it, but unfortunately that was just outside the return period, so I'm a little dubious about reliability. Might have just been a fluke, but I'd definitely test these thoroughly right away on arrival to watch out for duds.
