I bought a Kentucky mandolin some time ago...fairly typical of the mass produced, made in China instruments.  I went to change the strings on the mando and two of the hooks in the stamped tailpiece were bending up.  As I tightened up the new strings, one of the hooks broke off and two others were ready to go.  So, I tried to order a tailpiece that was a little more sturdy.  This stainless steel tailpiece looked different from the rest.  When I got it, I found it was about the same size as the original, but it weighed about 10% more (according to the mail scale).  Subjectively, it just seemed sturdier.  It took me about 10 minutes to swap it out with the broken one and a few more minutes to string it up again and it's working fine.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the cover doesn't fit worth a darn.  I haven't bothered to adjust it to make it fit, but I'll probably get around to it sooner or later, or maybe I'll crimp the original cover to make it fit the slightly narrower stainless tailpiece.<br /><br />I'd buy it again...but I'm hoping I won't have to.
