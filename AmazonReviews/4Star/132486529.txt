I wish they had an ear for sale... The kit works great, exactly as it should, but the OPERATOR (me) seems to have issues with the top & bottom few notes on the piano.  How do people do this?<br /><br />Do some googling for good instructions.  The first time it took QUITE some time, but I expect that the next will take less than half!
