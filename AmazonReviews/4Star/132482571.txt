I received the Pastrami Overdrive pedal from a friend about five years ago with the volume knob missing, and it has been on my pedalboard since. So after several hundred hours of use, no construction issues and great sound. Using the combination of volume and distortion provides great versatility in tone. I find the quality good and I recommend it to anyone hitting the stage.<br />Construction is actually metal and plastic. Mine lived for years in a rummage crate full of old effects, so I think this and five years of moderate service address much of the durability myth.
