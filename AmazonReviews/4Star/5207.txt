While it comes with instructions on how to tune the drum, they don't tell you how to know when it needs to be tuned.  I received this in perfect condition, well packaged.  It is 'loosely' tuned as all of them are because depending on here you are going to use them, ambient temperature and humidity, you might not want to tighten it up very much or you risk splitting the goat skin head.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this drum is it is truly hand made.  The inside is very rough with signs of hand made workmanship.  I can't speak for anyone else but I love that. You can tell an Indonesian carver made this drum.  It is exactly as described except the head isn't 10&#34;.  I have 7&#34; hands so this drum is a little small for me, especially when the playing surface measures 8 3/4&#34;.  The drum head measures 9 1/2&#34; from side to side, not including the mounting material.  When I play this drum, I'm using all fingers and no palm at all which isn't recommended.<br /><br />Except for the size, this drum sounds awesome, well constructed and is a good value.  I'm keeping this one, not only for it's design and cool factor but also for the possibly get others interested.  For someone with smaller hands than I have, it will be great for them.  Sound wise, it is better than I expected and much better than I heard on youTube.
