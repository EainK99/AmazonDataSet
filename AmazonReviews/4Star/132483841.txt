After much research and reading forums and procrastination, I replaced this neck for one of my strats that I highly customized from an original re-issue 1990s mexican strat (heavy as heck).  The neck on the original (like most re-issues of the 60s and 70s) was a bit on the shorter width side.  My high E string was barely on the fretboard and when I went in for a solo, sometimes the string would slip off and I would fret out.  Horrible for fast runs haha.<br /><br />I have many electrics (a couple american strats, tele, hollowbodies), but finally decided to throw money in to replace my mim vintage strat neck.  Necks are SUPER important to me.  This mighty mite guitar neck is really nice, especially for the price.  I thought I was getting a soft V neck (like my USA 1998 Fender Telecaster), but this turned out to be a hard V neck.  It took some getting used to and now I love it.  This is my go-to guitar for &#34;thumb over&#34; the top playing on those middle power chords.  Great for fast &#34;middle chords&#34; but not quite as comfortable on barre chords.  I grab one of my other guitars for that.<br /><br />The fit is a perfect replacement on Official Fender strats.  No fit issues.  The surprising part is that none of the holes are drilled for the tuning pegs (the large holes for the pegs are there, but none of the smaller holes for installing tuners).  Those are easy to drill.  I guess they don't want to pre-drill because they don't know what kind of tuners you'll have.  A little warning would have been nice though.<br /><br />The other thing they don't tell you:  None of the holes are pre-drilled at the base of the neck for installation to the guitar.  You have to be EXTREMELY carefull to drill these in.  I recommend taking it to a luthier if you don't know what you are doing.  If you are 1 degree off, you could screw up the positioning of the neck.  I drilled it myself, but consider myself lucky enough to be perfectly straight in line with the drilling and placement of the screws.  this is not like hanging a picture on the wall. you have to be precise if you want your guitar strings to be perfectly straight, in tune, playing right.<br /><br />I gave this product 4 stars because of lack of description of mentioning non pre-drilled holes and for not stating this is a Hard V neck vs a soft V neck.<br /><br />The neck itself plays and feels right.  The Medium Jumbo frets are my favorite (I'm not a fan of medium frets).  the unfinished neck has a nice feel.  It collects grime from your hands quicker than a finished neck, so wiping the neck down often is recommended.  All in all, I'd buy a Mighty Mite neck as a Fender Replacement neck again.  I'd probably get a soft V or try to find a shallow D neck though.  One hard V neck is enough for me.  One last comment.  I've played on friends' strats with $300 - $350 replacement necks.  Those necks don't feel better nor do they play like a $300 neck.  Just sayin... mighty mite necks are perfect inexpensive replacements.  I've had friends play on their expensive replacement necks and then sell them because it doesn't feel right.
