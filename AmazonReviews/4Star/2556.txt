Hard to decide 3 or 4 stars on this for me. I love a wedge pick. Maybe a little thicker than I would prefer. They move around a little more for me than I'd like, too. Put a Monster Grip pad on one and that's better, but still not my favorite pick. Really prefer the Planet Waves celluloid wedge (Light).
