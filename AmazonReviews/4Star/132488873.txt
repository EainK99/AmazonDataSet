I was a little skeptical of this product based on other reviews but I am glad that I purchased the product. These are plastic but very sturdy. I installed them into the frame of a drop cieling in my basement and it took less than an hour to install the brackets, mount the speakers and get everything fine tuned.<br /><br />I used these on the Bose Accoustimass 6 system (single small square speakers). Some reviews state that one or more of their arms wouldn't tighten down to hold the desired angle. Check to make sure the nut and bolt at that joint were put together properly. One side of the bracket is cut for the hex shape of the nut and the other is just a round opening for the bolt head. The nut and bolt were reversed on one of my bracket arms which created the free spinning when trying to tighten it down. Just reverse the nut and bolt and you should be all set.<br /><br />Another complaint was the shiny nuts and bolts that stand out. These aren't horrible and aren't even noticeable unless the lights are on (and then only when looking closely). Being a perfectionist though, I picked up a small bottle of black nail polish and put a light coat over the silver hardware. It was a cheap and easy solution to a minor inconvenience.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars instead of 5 simply because the packaging was poor. When I opened the box there was loose hardware (screws, nuts bolts, washers, etc) rattling around in the bottom. There was a small zip closed bag that had some hardware in it as well but there was a large hole in the side of the bag. It didn't take long to sort the pieces but the presentation left something to be desired and didn't do anything to add confidence that all the parts were there (they were all there though).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these as an inexpensive solution that not only installed easily but seems to be of decent quality.
