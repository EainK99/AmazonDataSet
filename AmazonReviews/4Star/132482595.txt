This little amp sounds nice.  It has a great clean tone that doesn't distort when turned all the way up. It is a heavy duty metal casing and should last a long, long time. I am using Bose ear bud type headphones and they sound great.  Headphones are not included.  I would recommend them to anyone.  A fine product
