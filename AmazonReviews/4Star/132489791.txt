So, to get the first thing out of the way; the floppy head.<br /><br />I bought mine at the Apple Store and yes, it came with the 'floppy' head.  I reached out to Blue support and they advised me that I could either A) return it, B) submit it for service, or C) tighten it with a T10x60 torque head.<br /><br />I opted for option C) and it took no time at all.  However, it seems in bad form that they are shipping it in this condition and incurring a lot of customer wrath as well as returns.<br /><br />To level set what my setup is, I have a small recording studio in my home for podcasting and voiceovers.  My equipment:  Tascam 144a USB mixer, Rode NT1A, Studio Projects C3, Blue Yeti, and now Blue Nessie.<br /><br />I use the Tascam when I need to mic a voice and an instrument.  However, I also like the simplicity of a USB mic when I'm just doing podcasting or voiceover work.<br /><br />I do very little instrumental stuff, so any time I talk about quality it is primarily about voice.<br /><br />I've seen a couple of people complaining about low gain... it seems that when the USB driver loads for this device it sets itself to medium on the volume side of things.  I was recording with Audacity and I just had to go under the covers and got it all working.  The gain was great after that, exactly what you'd expect from a condenser mic.<br /><br />In terms of the quality, I find it to be very good.  Like with any condenser mic, you are only as good as your room.  If you set the Nessie on the desk and talk sitting up, you'll have to up the gain enough to pick up the ambient noise of your room.  If you turn it down and want to talk close to the mic, you'll need to put the Nessie up on some books or some other arrangement.<br /><br />For the record, I use Audacity for recording and always use the noise removal filter after getting a room sample, and it worked like a champ with the Nessie.  Nice, clean voice recordings after the filter.<br /><br />I did find that it did pretty well without a windscreen.  Pops and T's and all that were pretty much taken care of in voice mode.  However, it is still a sensitive mic, so yeah, if you're going to be close to that thing, you might want to consider a pop screen, regardless.<br /><br />I only have one question, however... and that is: Why opt for this over the Yeti?<br /><br />The Yeti is more solidly built and has so many more patterns.  Omni, Figure 8, and stereo.  The sound quality is equal (and IMHO a little better on the Yeti), so the only thing going for a Nessie is weight and the pop filter/auto correction.  The Yeti costs the same, and is often listed on Amazon for almost $20 less.  If I'm a podcaster or do quick acoustic recordings, the Yeti is sort of a one-stop-shop.  For example, if I'm going to do an interview, I can just put it between the two people and put it into figure 8 pattern.<br /><br />PROS:  Very good sound<br />  ease-of-use<br />  in-mic monitoring<br />  Internal shockmount/pop-filter does a pretty decent job.<br /><br />CONS:  Shipped 'loose' from the factory and needed adjustments.<br />  Still sensitive, so this isn't a magic bullet for noise.  It won't filter out everything.<br />  Only one pattern, so this is a nice cardioid condenser mic for one voice/instrument.<br />  The Yeti still wins if you are shopping for that one usb mic.
