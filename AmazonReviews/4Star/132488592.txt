bought this to play a song that changes keys in the middle of the song.<br /><br />it took me a while to get used to sliding the capo seemlessly while playing.. (still a little rigid, though) but with practice, i can see how it can be quite useful!<br />the spring is really strong so it'll take some time before the spring adjusts to the neck on your guitar.
