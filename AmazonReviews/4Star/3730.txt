These strings sound as good and play as comfortably as everybody says, BUT: I bought &#34;heavy&#34; strings and the lowest they can go on my 25.5in guitar is drop Bb, then the bottom string starts gettin floppier than I want. But they sound great, and next time when I get Heaviest gauge I'll be completely happy. If you want to play death metal you should get heavier or heaviest strings.<br /><br />I mostly use them in Drop C and they're great.
