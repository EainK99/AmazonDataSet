I'm not sure I would base my career around the sound of this but if you need instant metal from any clean channel amp buy this. On my amp Blackstar the bass isn't able to go high enough for this pedal for my desire so I deducted one star since the pedal has no bass control. But when you buy this micro you knew this going in.  The sound still crunches real cool and it's worth a buy but I suggest the mothership metal muff model.
