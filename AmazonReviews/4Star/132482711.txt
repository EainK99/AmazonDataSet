After having to return two disney princess guitars that arrived with loose or broken strings, I decided to give this a try for my daughter.  It was a nice decent guitar, and she loved that it came with a strap, case and a pitch pipe.  Given that it was basically the same price as the disney guitar, this was a much better value.  It is a little big for small child, but overall worth the price.
