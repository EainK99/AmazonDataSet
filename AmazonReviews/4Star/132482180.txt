I have 2 problems with this bass. The first one is that when it arrived out of the box the strings rattled a lot. That can be fix with adjusting the bridge with the included hex wrench and second is that if you plan on using the strap a lot, order another strap ive had my bass for 2 weeks and i have already broken mine. This is probably do to me since i do  play for long periods of time during the day. OVeerall great bass for a great price.
