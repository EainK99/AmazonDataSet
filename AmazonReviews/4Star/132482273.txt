The display is very readable but you have to be looking at<br />it from a near perpendicular angle.  Maybe I'm using it wrong but I<br />have trouble finding anywhere to clip it but my pegs.  But from there it works great,<br />just have to work to find a peg at the right position to afford a  good angle.
