I am using the leds to light my aft cabin I placed in ddirectly on the teak trim on the ceiling it stuck great. After seeing how well it does I will be using it to replace my standard 12v lighting. I like that the leds can be used for 12v and 110. Next will be lighting the salon and the rest of the boat. My son will love it in the V-Birth.<br />Once I use it outside in the deck and fly-bridge area I will post again to give the updates.<br /><br />I thought the ribbon would be bulky and harder to place without being an eye sore when it was off but it is slim and flat also light weight so I can see how the 3M tape would work. It is the same tape that is used in window shrink film for the winter season. If you prep the surface correctly it will stick well. Now about the heat and getting hot. So far mine stays cool no hot spots when used indoors.
