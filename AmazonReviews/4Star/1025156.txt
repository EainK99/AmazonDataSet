These things, although not exactly &#34;audiophile&#34; headphones, are simply the most versatile over-the-ear headphones you can buy. They don't need a headphone amp to shine, they are good for casual listening, reference and studio work, and they are built well. I use these headphones more often than any other pair. Some higher-end stuff, particularly Sennheisers, Grados and Etys, will sound better with some setups but I would never think about using any of those as dedicated studio phones. The fact that MDR-7506's can do double-duty in the studio and in the home makes them an excellent buy. The cord, which is about 700 feet long and coiled, could be annoying to some but I like it because it allows me to plug in my phones to my home system and still take a stroll about the neighborhood.
