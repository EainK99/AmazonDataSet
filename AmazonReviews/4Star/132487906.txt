OK, for some reason, most of these people who buy this mic doesn't really know what they are saying. On the menu clearly said, \\"must use a gold plated xlr cable or better\\". Which mean, the mic must use a xlr cable that is worth the same price or more than the mic itself. And above all that, it does matter by the interface too. If you get a cheap one, then sucks for you for trying to go cheap because this mic needs a lot of phantom power just to make it have good quality. This mic is a good mic itself no lie. I took weeks to research about this mic to see if it really worth buying for it's price, and it was. But the down fall about this mic is that even if the price is low, every other equipment that you have to buy for this mic to work properly isn't cheap, from the interface to the cable and ect. That's why I give it a four star because of all the other equipment, but then the mic is great.
