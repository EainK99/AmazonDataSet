Nice unit - Sounds REALLY GOOD.  Yes, the battery door is CRAP - maybe worse than CRAP.  I have a ty-rap at the ready for when it breaks.  Be very gentile and it should last a while. Easy to use - no bells, no whistles.  It has no adjustments that you have to fiddle with.  It has a setting for &#34;cable tone&#34;  Has a transmitter battery signal strength meter on the receiver that you can easily see. First time I used it thought it was broke 'cause the little cable to the transmitter from the instrument is BAD. Gee - Should I like this thing or what?  It has two flaws - the short cable - (Replace it)  Weak battery door (be easy on it) It's inexpensive - But I REALLY, REALLY like the way this thing sounds.  I did a side-by-side with a good cable and couldn't hear any difference.
