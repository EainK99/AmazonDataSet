Quite impressed with these inexpensive pickups.  Easy to install (if you know what your doing) - they fit perfectly in my Epiphone LP Custom.  They sound really good for inexpensive set.  The only thing is that they seem to be hot pickups - which can be good or bad depending on your playing style.  They have a small tendency to feedback if your close to your monitors.  Other than that, recommended.
