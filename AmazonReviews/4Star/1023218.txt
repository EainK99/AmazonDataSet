I bought two of these to install under a concrete ledge around my outdoor kitchen. I connected the two so that I only need to plug in one power transformer. I have them on a dusk to dawn timer with no issues after a month so far.<br /><br />Pros: Waterproof, appear to be good quality, low wattage.<br />Cons: Remote control seems to be of cheap construction, 3M tape is worthless.<br />Suggestions: I used contact cement to get the light strip adhered to the concrete. Simply peel the tape backing and brush a coat on the light strip (lay out all 16 ft on a flat surface) and then a coat on the surface to be mounted to. Wait 15 minutes and then mount from one end to the other, pushing firmly as you go. Have a other person hold the other end as you go. If finally, take some Marine Goop (or similar) and work it all around during the connections. This will keep moisture out of the connection, assuring a corrosion-free connection.<br /><br />Overall, these are well worth the price. Feel free to post any questions and I'll try to answer.
