Overall I'm satisfied with the value I got from purchasing this pedal.  The one main feature that this pedal is missing is an auto-start feature.  Many loop pedals won't start recording until sound is passed through it; this one starts as soon as you tap the switch which makes it difficult to create an accurate loop.
