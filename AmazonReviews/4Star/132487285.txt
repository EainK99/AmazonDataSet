We have installed 25 &#34;plus&#34; Hitlights this year. The lighting is excellent, the bulbs well designed, and the value above average for LED lights. However, we have had to return one light within 6 months of use and another appears to be going bad. The bulb begins to flicker.<br />Hitlights can determine your purchase from Amazon and will send you a shipping label and exchange the bulb very timely.
