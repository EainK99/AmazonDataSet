Classic marshall sound. Best deal on an el-34 powered tube amp. Wish they would have gave us 3 tone controls on the clean channel for more versitility. Also power scaling and maybe a rectifier would have been nice, but what do you expect for $500. Maybe a mid level for $750 with a few more bells and whistles, but definitely not any more watts! Any louder and I couldn't crank it up to the sweet edge of breakup sound at a show! But seriously, very good marshall tone at much lower volume than a 50 watter. And reverb! Who decided all of a sudden we didn't need reverb? Well this amp has it! And it's good! Honestly if you go any more powerful than this you limit yourself to crystal clean sounds at usable volumes or overdriven sounds at unusable (way too loud to use live) volumes. Crank up the volume and be your own guitar hero!
