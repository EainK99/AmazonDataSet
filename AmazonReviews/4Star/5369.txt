I have purchased two scissor arms from NEEWER. One with and one without the XLR cable built into the arm. Both are great values for the money. The one with the built-in XLR I've had now for two years and it's still performing well. I use both of these boom arms for my voiceover/podcasting studio. I don't move them around a whole lot, just making small adjustments. When I was working in commercial radio I would stand and sit and move the boom arm all over the place. In the end for basic voiceovers this arm seems to do the trick. The only gripe I have with the arm is how much weight it can handle. If you have a really heavy professional condenser mic (something over 1 lb), use it in a commercial radio studio etc... you may want to get something a little more hefty.
