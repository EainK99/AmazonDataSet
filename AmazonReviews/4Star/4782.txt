I purchased this for my daughter in college in the marching band.  It is a God-send as far as lugging around this lightweight highly padded backpack case.  To her, it's life-changing, is not sure how she survived 6 years without it.  This is so much better than fighting with the big boxy heavy non-forgiving sax cases.  The downside is the backpack is TIGHT so it's a bit of an effort to squeeze the saxophone into the case.  Once that is accomplished, there's no room for other essentials.  There's a small pouch and pocket but nothing large enough to accommodate the music.  I believe the front triangular area you see pictured could be reworked to accommodate a pocket for music.  With or without the music, it's sturdy, lightweight, easy to use, protective and ideal to carry esp for younger kids, smaller kids, those using small lockers, or those on-the-go like college students who walk across campus or in traveling bands and orchestras.  I embroidered her last name on the shoulder strap for easy identification.  The straps are very sturdy.
