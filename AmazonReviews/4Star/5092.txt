These XLR cables are certainly not high quality in their construction, but if you're reading reviews for a 10 pack of XLR cables for $40, you likely already know that.  Truth is, they're not as bad as I expected for the price.<br /><br />The important thing is, all of mine worked fine out of the box and are still working 3-4 months later with light home studio work.  I use them for drum mics, so they mostly just stay plugged in in one place.  Not sure if I would trust them on any important gigs unless I had backups, but none of them have failed me yet in light personal use.
