I wasn't very impressed with this microphone when I first used it.. It took awhile to adjust to it and I wasn't getting the sound I desired when using it with a new amplifier..  The more I used it with the new amp the better it began to sound and the better I was able adapt to using the effects that are made possible by the design...  Most of my problem with sound was due to the amp needing to break in.. I have been mostly using bullet microphones for a few decades and expect to continue using them but the more I use the Madcat the the more versatile I find it to be...
