I put this kit on a 1997 Telecaster plus. Installation was easy but take your time and do it right. Everything is of good quality but note to those who will put this on a Telecaster. The clearance between the front bar(we're the strings go under) and the bridge is very short. The bridge supplied by the manufacture is intended for a Fender Jaquare. As such, you are limited to how low you can set the string hight befor bottoming out on the bridge support plates. My fix was to drop another $168.00 for a Mastery Bridge. With that additional cost, I now have an ax that has a beautiful telecaster tone and will sustain till the end of days. The bigsby is strong and I use it alot as the lead picker in a Rockabilly band. If it wasn't for the bridge issue I would have given it five stars.
