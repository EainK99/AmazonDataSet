The line 6 FBV Express Mkll 4 button foot controller has 4 preset buttons. It also has a volume/wah pedal. This pedal uses an Ethernet cable and will only work with line 6 products. That being said if you have a line 6 amp, this pedal is a must have for the amp!!! The pedal is extremely durable. The pedal also will need some oiling every once in a while otherwise when you're doing swells in the middle of a worship set everyone in the crowd will suddenly hear a loud squeak! Lol! This is from experience Lol!!! Anyway I highly recommend This pedal to anyone who loves there line 6 amp and wants to expand its capabilities.
