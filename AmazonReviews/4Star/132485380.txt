The case that arrived with the instrument was better than advertised.  The instrument &#34;passed muster&#34; with my child's beginning band instructor.  Time will tell regarding its durability.  I took one star off due to the mouthpiece arriving with two small tarnish marks.  This is our second LJ Hutchen instrument.  The first was their alto saxophone which is now in its third year of service for my other child in our grade school's award-winning concert band.  For both instruments it was less expensive to buy the LJ Hutchen instruments out-right than to pay for a one-year rental.  While neither instrument has required repairs to date, the only potential disadvantage vs. renting/buying locally might be the ease of finding someone to service the instruments should that become necessary.
