The sound is great.  It is not to hard to install. I installed it in a Taylor 813.  I chose an external lead over drilling a hole in the guitar.  The extra lead is about $20.  I gave only four stars because of having  to pull the strings off and removing the pickup to change the battery.  I did not care for the warranty either.  You have to send the product back to the dealer that you bought it from and there will be a $65 repair fee.  If you bought it from ebay or amazon, it would be a hassle.
