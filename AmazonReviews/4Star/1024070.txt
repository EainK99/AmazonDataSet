This review is for the SGC-698.<br /><br />I use this camera with a T3i for recreational shooting. Here are the pros and cons I've found after a couple months of use.<br />Pros:<br />-Self-Powered, so it doesn't draw power from the camera battery.<br />-20db switch, which helps boost the audio and cuts down on hiss in my camera.<br />-Small and light.<br />-Comes with a deadcat cover, which helps cut down on windnoise.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It doesn't do a great job at cutting out background noise.<br />-The range isn't very good. After more than about 6 feet away, it is very quiet.<br /><br />I wasn't ready to drop a lot of money on a Rode since I making videos is just a hobby. For the money, this mic is a good improvement over the built in microphone in my DSLR.
