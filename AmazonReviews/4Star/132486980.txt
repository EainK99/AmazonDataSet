This is solidly built with adjustable legs. It is able to adjust to fit a number of different sized keyboards and can be matched with the second tier stand (which works really well). Allows the player to put legs under the stand without having a bar between your legs or in the way. You can adjust the height of the stand to allow for playing in the standing position as well.
