I love everything about this uke except……. the top (G) string does not sound through the pick up when plugged in. Since I wanted one I could plug in and plat through an amp, I'm still debating wether or not to send it back. I wish I could do an exchange but it seems that is not possible.<br />The wood is beautiful, and the finish is nice too. The tuner works great, and it has a nice acoustic sound.
