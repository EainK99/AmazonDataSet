I've tried several genres of music and overall these headphones sound phenomenal. But, they aren't very comfortable because they don't fit my head perfectly. I have them on the lowest setting (as they came stock) yet the bottom of the muffs are almost touching my lower jaw! If they built a smaller (narrower) set with the same audio quality, I'd definitely buy it!<br /><br />I'm giving them a few weeks before I make my decision, unfortunately. :(
