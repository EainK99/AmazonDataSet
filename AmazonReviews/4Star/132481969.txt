I just got these bags and here's what I think:<br /><br />They ain't great but they are definitely better than nothing!  Obviously if you think you're gonna spend $50 and protect your $3000 DW kit with something like this you're a fool, but if you play in a bar band, and you have a \\"road warrior\\" kit that you just want to keep the dust off of then this may be for you.<br /><br />The set I got these for is a PDP FS birch kit that I actually really like.  I bought it dirt cheap and it already had a few nicks and scratches on it so I'm not overly concerned about it anyway, I just want to keep it covered up during travel or storage.  My main kit though would get better than these.<br /><br />NOTE: these bags have absolutely no padding at all, so keep that in mind.  I'm gonna throw an old towel in each one to create a little cushion, I figure a little padding and these things are good enough for the price.
