Awesome little pedal. I have used a Micropog for years, and while this most definitely is not a MicroPog, for my needs it has almost replaced it on my board. I like the fact I can use it with an expression pedal too, which is unique to this pedal. I highly recommend using with a reverb and swell with it for organ type sounds. I keep the switch mostly on the lower toggle so I can emulate a bass line to start off a song with looping etc.. cant be beat for the price.
