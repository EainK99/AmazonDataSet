This was the most inexpensive trombone stand I found, and its quality is more than decent for the price. There are no unusual features nor anything special about the stand. It's basic and simple, and the same as many stands I saw that cost considerably more. My one point of irritation is that one of the rubber feet came off in transit, and I have no idea how to get a replacement.
