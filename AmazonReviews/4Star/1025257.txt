Great product, works as advertised, power brick doesn't get very hot when powering whole string.<br /><br />The two plastic eyelets on the white control device broke off when screwing down.  The first one I thought I just tighten too much, but the second one was only tightened until it wouldn't allow the control module to lift up, and it too broke off.  Ended up using ultra-strong Velcro.
