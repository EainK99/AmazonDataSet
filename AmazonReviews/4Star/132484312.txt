I would have rated this product a 5/5, but when looking at the pictures I had thought that it had 3.5 mm jacks, but just so that everyone knows, it is a 1/4 in jack for all.<br /><br />But, after reading ratings, I thought I would have to buy a EU/US power adapter, but now it seems to come with the proper US cord so that I can use it at home without the adapter. Thanks for reading the ratings and fixing that!
