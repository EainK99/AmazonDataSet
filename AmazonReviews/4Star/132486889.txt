People are critiquing this item as if it were a $300 acoustic. It's not, so lets not treat it that way. This is a starter guitar for a child... if you child shows more interest, after the fact, feel free to get a nicer guitar.<br />I would have given it 5 stars, but the frets were a little rusted (nothing that a little TLC didn't fix, though)
