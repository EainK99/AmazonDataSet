I wanted a small shofar. This fills the bill and works fine.  It is much shorter than the picture, and not shaped as nice, kind of like the picture would look if you cut off both ends leaving only the center portion.  I supose if you measure along the curve it might be 11&#34; long, but a straight line from end to end is more like 7&#34;.  It does sound good, and is easier to transport than my Large one.  The price was reasonable and shipping was quick.
