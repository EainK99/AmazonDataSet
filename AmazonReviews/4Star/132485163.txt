I bought this trumpet for my brother, since he started learning how to play in school. He used to use a friends trumpet but the case was crazy heavy, and the trumpet was beat up and was dropped. It sounded alright, but he needed something better. So i bought this for him. The case is light, and has straps which you can wear like a book bag, my brother loves that the best. The trumpet looks great, sounds great, comes with valve oil, a cleaning cloth, and white gloves. Don't see the point of the white gloves, they are really small, but it does come with them. It says it used to cost over $500 dollars, i don't if that's true, but i got it on sale  for 130, can't beat that. The case is a little small, but very light, the one my brother used was heavier by 3 pounds, so he is very excited about this trumpet. I definitely recommend this for a student, or even anyone who wants to learn to play the trumpet.
