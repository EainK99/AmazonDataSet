We purchased this four our church. We had a 7 disk duplicator and between CD's and DVD's could not keep up. Got this because it said it was fast and the burners were connected through SATA instead of IDE. This takes about 5 minutes longer to burn the same 7 that our other burner takes. I did not want to compare 10 to 7 in order to make it fair. It takes roughly 5 minutes longer which can be an eternity when you have church customers waiting for today's service. Everything else works great. It does not have a dedicated Master drive, so assign one. Very easy to use. Oh and the price is awesome. Anywhere else we looked these were $200 and higher in price. Get this, you won't regret it.
