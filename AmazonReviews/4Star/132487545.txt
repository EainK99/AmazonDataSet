This stand rises to a good height for tall musicians who don''t like<br />to sit and play.  It's easy to assemble and then collapse and put away.<br />It's sturdy enough I think, though could have a stronger tilt mechanism.<br />I can, however, put Arban's method book on it with no<br />fear of it slipping.  I think the holes do make it lighter, and that is good.<br />All things considered I like it.
