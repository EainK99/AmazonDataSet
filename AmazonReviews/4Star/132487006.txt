I bought this sax because I  wanted to start playing again. Its a beautiful horn, but I did notice that it was out of tune,  soI had to go get it adjusted and wasn't too happy about that. Once I got past that, this horn gives you a crisp, nice sound, volume is great. Easy to hit those low notes. The mouth piece is a little big and took me a little bit to get my embouchure adjusted but overall this sax is worth what I paid for it.
