After almost two decades I recently started playing the guitar again, rather than just listening to it being played. I bought an electric guitar and (while re-learning how to play) discovered a whole new world of audio production and effects that simply didn’t really exist back when I last played. Before trying the Presonus Audiobox I had been using a Real Tone USB cable which was developed to use your guitar with the video game rocksmith as a learning tool. It can also serve as a basic recording tool. So I’m a relative newbie.<br /><br />The idea behind the Presonus Audiobox iOne is to provide a simple, digital interface for the musician/ audio person on the move; a simple box that can interface with your mobile devices anywhere: at the studio, at a gig, at your workstation. To do this they focused on the most important features: simplicity, ease of use and portability.<br /><br />The Device.<br /><br />The Presonus Audiobox iOne is a small box about the size of a stack of 5 CD cases. It’s made from a wrap-around sheet of aluminum that sandwiches a plastic block of electronics for protection and incorporates grippy rubber feet on the base to keep it secure on a flat surface.  It has a distinctive marine blue metallic finish that is synonymous with the Presonus brand.<br /><br />Controls on the device are minimalist.<br /><br />Power LED: This light flashes blue when a device such as a tablet or computer is hooked up and provides a suitable 5v power source. Mobile devices need a separate USB source to provide enough power to drive the Audiobox such as a phone charger outlet adapter like you get with your phone or tablet. When there is both power and an instrument plugged into the device, the power LED changes from flashing to solid blue.<br /><br />Inputs: On the front you have your two inputs: Channel 1 and 2 in the form of a large Mic (XLR socket)  and instrument socket (which accepts ¼ inch (6.3mm) mono TS or stereo TRS plugs). You can buy an adapter or cable to convert the Mic to accept another instrument if needed.<br /><br />Channels: Each channel has its gain control knob (similar to volume but with both positive and negative adjustment of the source signal) and accompanying micro LED which lights up green but changes to red if your frequencies peak beyond a safe range.  This is a useful warning indicator when hooking up to a big amp.<br /><br />Two Illuminated Toggle buttons: There is the 48v mic channel boost (for certain types of microphones; check this as you can damage your mic if it doesn’t support it) and Direct switch for monitoring as you record and mix between playback and input signals.<br /><br />Large Master Volume Knob: This controls output volume to your amplifier or powered speakers. There is also a separate headphone volume knob and 1/4 inch (6.3mm) headphone socket.<br /><br />On the rear of the unit you have two USB sockets. Type A for your mobile devices and a powered Type B for Desktop computers and external power sources. There is also a socket for a third-party lock you can purchase separately and two ¼ inch TS sockets for Active Monitors (powered speakers) or amplifier.<br /><br />Overall I like the design and layout except that the buttons and knobs stick out about ½ inch from the face of the box. As a result, they can get caught on something when stuffed in a bag. It would be nice if they had a push-down option to let them be recessed into the box. That would probably knock up the price though.<br /><br />Setup and software.<br /><br />The Presonus comes with one USB Type A to USB Type B cable for providing power. You will have to supply your own for hooking up your mobile device.  Also included are minimalist instructions printed on a couple of letter size sheets which include a serial number. You have to sign up and register your device on the Presonus webpage where you have access to the full manual in PDF format. They also provide drivers and software for you to use with your audiobox for Windows, Mac and mobile iOS devices.<br /><br />This is where you get some extra value for money in the form of  Progression 3 and Studio One 3 Artist edition. You also get Capture Duo for iPad which is a two-track recording app that can send your recording wirelessly to the Personus iOne. Overall, there are about 5gb of downloads if you include all the instruments and effects in the form of add-on soundbanks. They are listed individually and can be downloaded separately. So you don’t have to download everything at once.<br /><br />The main software that comes with the Personus is Studio One v3 which is their DAW software. The Artist edition lets you do everything with the supplied soundbanks that you could want but I was still slightly disappointed. I’m really interested in realtime guitar effects which typically come as a plugin for DAW software and let you replace various guitar effects pedals with plugin effects you can run in real time. Unfortunately, the Artist addition of Studio One does not support third-party VST or other common format plugins. To use those you have to buy an $80 upgrade or the pro version.<br /><br />Other than that quibble, the only real limitation in the DAW software are that the Presonus iOne is only able to record two tracks at once. So if you’re doing a multi-track recording you will have to spend some extra time creating, storing and importing your tracks.  But you’re not restricted otherwise.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />The Presonuse Audiobox iOne works very well for me. It’s a big step up from my Rocksmith Realtone cable. Sound quality when recording is pretty simple. The iPad software is quite basic but gets the job done and transfers tracks wirelessly so long as you use the Presonus software. I don’t have an iPad of my own so I used it primarily with me XPS 15 notebook. The sound-banks that come with it are comprehensive and sound good. The DAW is a little complicated for a beginner but not that bad. In the end, the only thing that was disappointing was that there no support for third party plugins such as Guitar Rig, Amplitube, Amp Room and Positive Grid Bias Desktop and FX. There are shareware and donationware DAW applications that will let you use those plugins since Presonus uses the ASIO standard API for very low latency audio input and output. It just seems a shame that Studio One has the plugin feature removed because $80 for an addon is quite a bit when there are free though admittedly less polished and not as well supported alternatives out there.<br /><br />Overall I am pretty impressed with it, especially given its price which at the time of this review is $100.indows, Mac and mobile iOS devices.<br /><br />This is where you get some extra value for money in the form of  Progression 3 and Studio One 3 Artist edition.
