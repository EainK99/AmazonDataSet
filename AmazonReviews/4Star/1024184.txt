String posts are a little bit loose which is not a defect, it is typical for tuners without a screw.<br />Build quality is very good. The little mounting screws are a bit narrower (the same thread) than the holes on my original 70s strat. Had to put some wood cuttings inside the holes just to use the black screws (the original chrome ones would also fit the tuners)<br />Pegs move very tight which is super cool after the original (from 77) sloppy ones<br /><br />Finally the only reasonable solution for an F-styled guitar without the need to make new holes (there is also Graph Tech for twice the price).
