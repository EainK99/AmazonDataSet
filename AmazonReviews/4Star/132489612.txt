Ok, first and foremost. AMD processors are NOT supported with the DJ Serato program it comes with. You can, however download ITCH software for free, but you will lose some feature that would've come with the newer Serato DJ. And by the by, Serato is replacing ITCH, so future ITCH updates are unlikely.<br /><br />Secondly, if you are using Ableton live. I am currently trying to get the program to take inputs from the 380, but its taking alot of extra work. It's not on the standard list of selectable midi and it wont recognize it as a useable controller. Even though it is a MIDI controller.<br /><br />Another, issue I have with it is that for personal home use the only sound output I can get is through the headset plug on the controller. So if you have, say, a tutorial in the background or want to chat with someone on skype while playing. It's annyoing.<br /><br />If you are really looking for a proper review (as you should be) Youtube controller reviews and make sure its what you are looking for. I simply wanted to write this &#34;review&#34; as a word of caution. Again, this is not a FULL review about the controller as a whole.
