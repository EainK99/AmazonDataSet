I bought some of these because I saw Eric Johnson used this style of string (he has his own signature brand, though). Overall, they are OK. They sound kind of &#34;mellow&#34; or &#34;muted&#34; to me. I don't hate them, but I still think I like GHS Boomers better, especially since I play a lot of clean stuff on my Stratocaster. Removing brightness isn't a bad thing depending on what sound you're going for, so it's not necessarily a negative. If you ARE looking remove some brightness, you may want to consider these.
