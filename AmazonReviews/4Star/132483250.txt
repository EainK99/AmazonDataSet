The quality of the strings is outstanding but they are pricy. Smooth playing but bright for a flat wound. The gauge is a bit larger than I'm used too, and you may need a truss rod adjustment after you put them on to combat all the extra tension. They play like having steel rods on your bass and not strings. Other than that and the mark up in price, THUMBS UP!
