They just arrived today. I ran out to my shop and plugged them into my 12V DC power supply to check if they all worked... They did! This would have gotten five stars but two inches down from the power connector the water resistant coating was ripped and separated from the LED strip.... I bought extra ends so no bid deal i guess... Just a disappointment on a brand new toy. I plan to use them as back up lighting in my shop and carport this winter during power outages. If I remember ill try to post a updated review when winter hits *** 7/24/15 UPDATE*** So I just did a quick check of my emergency shop lighting I used these LEDS for... the relay is working perfectly... the LED strip i put inside my shop works flawlessly... Unfortunately the LED strip I put in my carport for vehicle security only has about 40% of the LEDs working.... I'm not sure why this is as they are both dry and under cover.... either way I am bout to buy another strip and reinstall one half in the carport and cut the other half into sections to light up my gun safe. The strips have probably seen roughly 30-40hrs of light total...
