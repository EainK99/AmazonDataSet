The Stanton DJC4 is a terrific controller for someone just starting out or upgrading from the mixtrack pro or other entry level dj controller, or just somebody starting out. Its ease of use and aproachability is matched only by its capabilities, with super low latency buttons and fades and an extremely powerful sound card, there's not much this controller cant do.<br />It only comes with virtual dj le so an upgrade will have to taken into account when thinking about price. The traktor mapping isn't quite as good as it could be, but with some tweaking it is just as good as any real traktor controller. Stanton is a Gibson company so the rma process can be a bit of a long winded ordeal but in the end it isn't as bad as it could be.
