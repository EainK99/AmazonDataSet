for less than 11 bucks I figured why not,, I am now ordering more! I do karaoke shows and just plug it in and it fills up the whole bar,, the bar owners want some now!!I dropped it my first night,, IT STILL WORKS!! Why pay $80 or more for a LED light when these little guys work just fine,,, I had no problems with the legs falling off,, I have had no problems at all, I have used them 4 times already still working great,,,,
