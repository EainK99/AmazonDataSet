I purchased this for my father-in-law who uses it for coaching soccer practices, assemblies and teaching gym classes.<br /><br />It works great for all those purposes.  Comes with a wireless mic in the box and is iPod (regular, not nano) compatible.<br /><br />He has not run it long enough continuously to test the 5 hour battery life, but has no complaints for around 2 hours.<br /><br />Overall great item if you teach or coach, or know someone who does.
