Exceptional D/A converters warm clear sound with lots of headroom. Would have been nice to see ADAT or at least SPDIF on the back. The drivers failed several times on my Macbook Pro but I managed to get them to install separately with Pacifist. The latency is the lowest I've seen.<br />For what I needed ( live keyboards through the Mac ) it's simple, it's Thunderbolt so no power cord needed and at this price point a no brainer.
