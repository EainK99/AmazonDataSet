This microphone matched our system well and both children and adults were clearly heard when used in our church.  Being a novice at shopping for devices of this type, I would have found it helpful if the fact that &#34;phantom power&#34; is required  for condenser mikes had been a footnote somewhere.  Lastly, it seems odd that a simple mounting base is not typically supplied by most microphone vendors.
