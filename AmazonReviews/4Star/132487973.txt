I bought these to see if they might be an answer to a pair of noisy components in my rack system. Changing to these Mogamis significantly reduced the noise level. They probably are better shielded and definitely more flexible than most of the competition. However, the good stuff costs more; always has. If you do shredding and metal stuff you probably could get by with less expensive wires. But, if you do more quiet stuff like jazz and standards I would recommend them. Like I said in the title, it depends. The nice thing is that cables like these you only have to buy once.
