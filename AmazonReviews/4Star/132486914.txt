These are the best sounding headphones I have ever owned, and I have owned many pairs over the years (including Sony, Koss, JVC and others).  The Bluetooth technology makes them very easy to use without having to connect any wires to your stereo or other listening device.  The sound quality is very good.  The only slight issue I have with them is that you can't adjust the fit, they tend to slip down over extended listening periods.  I also appreciate the rechargeable lithium ion battery, which has held a charge for multiple hours of listening (I have only had to charge them up once over the last two months).<br /><br />They were easy to pair with my Bluetooth phone (BB Q10) and they sound great with my Neutron music player.  However, I have not been able to pair them up with my Sony PS3 system for some reason, still investigating what the issue might be. Regardless, I can recommend these to anyone looking for a pair of high quality wireless headphones (and I bought them when the price was only $38.00, normally $130!).
