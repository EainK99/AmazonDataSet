This is a well built case.  I have the soft-sided version of this case as well...both are good depending on your needs.  Overall its sturdy, good enough for air travel if you put in in the overhead bin or under your seat.  It is definitely not meant for being used as a checked bag.  I would rate this bag as bump resistant.  I do believe it would crush if more than 10 lbs of weight was nicely placed on the case.  If you drop something heavy on this case with your uke inside, then expect to see damage.  Since there are not a lot of reviews for this case I will break out some pros and cons that I have observed so far...<br /><br />Pros: Heavy nylon outer fabric.  An inch of padding all the way around.  Somewhere sandwiched in the padding is some sort of stiff/thin plastic material.  Fits my pineapple ukulele quite nicely.  Will also fit normal soprano ukes.  There are additional foam blocks that can be positioned to make for a tighter fit.  There are backpack straps under a velcro enclosure...you can use one strap and sling this like a messenger bag, or use both straps.  If you use a single strap, the other can be hidden.<br /><br />Cons: This is a relatively new product, so there are not a lot of reviews.  The designs/pattern in the nylon fabric are OK, but it would be nice if this was sold in solid colors as well.  The only weak point in this design is the main zipper which seems a bit too flimsy.  I think this case would be about perfect if they popped for a slightly heavier/higher quality zipper.<br /><br />Expect to pay twice as much or more for a case that you could check in the airline.  For the price, I don't think you could do much better.
