Blue Microphones are known for their sound quality and are popular among many YouTubers who are starting out. This particular microphone has 3 settings to adjust what sounds it picks up, but for the most part, you'll keep it on the same setting. I recommend making a test recording and switching it to all three settings to see which one makes you sound the best.<br /><br />The microphone has a red LED light that indicates it is getting power when it is plugged in. This is actually quite annoying at night because even when my PC is off, it still feeds the microphone power which keeps that bright light on. It's not too much of an issue, but I figured I'd mention it.<br /><br />The mic comes on a small tripod that allows the mic to raise or lower by a few inches as well as rotate the mic 360 degrees and even tilt a small amount for the best possible angle to capture your voice.<br /><br />It uses a USB A to USB B cable to connect to your PC and the cord is decently long. The cable itself is durable and looks clear which is unique.<br /><br />Finally I'd like to mention that even though the audio quality of this mic is great, it is a bit quiet a lot of the time so the audio needs boosted before being put in a final project. However, for every day use it will work fine.<br /><br />I really enjoy my snowball, but it wasn't always that way. When I first plugged in the mic, it did not work properly. It made crackling and popping sounds, but didn't record my voice when I hit record. I figured it was DOA, but didn't bother returning it. Many months later, I got it out again and tried to record, but I had the same issues as before. After some research I found that uninstalling the driver for the snowball and then reinstalling it will fix this issue. Now it works great and I use it all the time!<br /><br />All and all, I'm giving this product 4 stars out of 5 due to the low audio levels and the high chance that it will not work when you plug it in the first time.
