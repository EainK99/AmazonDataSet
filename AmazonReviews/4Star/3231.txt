This bass was a great deal from the seller compared to many other online sites or stores. Overall it has a few bugs, like some weird circuitry that causes hum in the output and unresponsiveness from the volume knob. Also, the string that ship on it are cheap, so you'll want to replace them no matter who you purchase from. Also, even though it looks like a stained solid wood finish, that is really some kind of design that is either screened on or otherwise applied (though it is done quite well). Overall I really like this bass though. For the money, it's a great bargain on a well made instrument. These are hard to get now and the seller had trouble shipping it to me within the 2 day prime timeframe but they contacted me and overnighted it to me as soon as possible just a couple of days later and included some extras (ball cap and key chain).
