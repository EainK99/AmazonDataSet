The packaging I received looked a little different than pictured, but it seems to be the same thing overall.  I use these for labeling CAT-style cable in commercial installs.  I do not see how you'd really use them well in the way pictured, and I like to have fairly verbose labels anyway.  I attach them like a &#34;flag,&#34; and find that there is just enough of the clear tape to fold over the front, perfectly protecting the writing.
