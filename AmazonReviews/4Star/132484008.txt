I bought this because of the combination of ash body, 9-1/2&#34; fingerboard radius and nitro finish.  The fully adjustable bridge saddles are a bonus (unique to this model?).  They look similar to the old adjustable in pairs type and so far they work perfectly. Overall quality is good but the setup needs adjustment to quiet a buzzung low E string and ballance the volume between neck and bridge pick-ups.  Sounds great through my Fender Deluxe amp with clear clean tone.  The bridge pick-up is bright and snappy and the neck pick-up is much fuller and warmer, although a bit heavy on the bass end.  I'm surprised by the versatility and look forward to years of enjoyment as I learn to unleash it's potential.
