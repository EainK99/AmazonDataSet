No matter what price range, Yamaha seems to maintain excellent manufacturing standards to ensure well-built instruments.<br /><br />Now, this is the low end of their price range, so they certainly use lower grade materials to keep the price down, but Yamaha still manages to make the instrument look &#34;nice&#34;, i.e. paint the backside and neck matte black to cover the not-so-pretty wood used.<br /><br />Does it look fantastic? No. There's little bumps and divots on the neck if you look really close, but the instrument still is very presentable. The spruce top looks nice.<br /><br />Sound: okay, so there's some complaints about the APXT2 not having a full sound, especially in the lower range. Well no kidding, folks. It's a 3/4 guitar, though the body is even smaller than other brands' 3/4 guitars. Think Jethro Tull's &#34;Thick As A Brick&#34; guitar opening; the small-body Martin Ian Anderson uses is what this guitar's sound reminds me of---which I like! It has its purpose.<br /><br />Plugging it in: I do not have an acoustic amp, so I will refrain from giving much assessment here, but I did plug it into my Peavey Classic 30 tube amp and there was no buzz or anything like that. My guess is it would be just fine with the proper amplification.<br /><br />Pros: good sound, very playable, aesthetically pleasing, on-board tuner works well.<br /><br />Cons: tuning machines are sloppy, which is probably the cause of it slipping out of tune a bit between playing sessions<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this guitar for anyone looking for a lighter sound, something to noodle on, travel with, etc. Good for small hands or children too!
