Its really pretty good, I cant complain to much.. as far as learning how to program it, the instructions are pretty basic and a trip to You Tube land would help you a little. and to figure out how to program the joystick,,,, you might want to talk to Chauvet directly as I could fine ZERO info on line about how to do this. other then that its well worth the money I think, but the speed and fader sliders are not as sensitive as I would like then to be. but other than that , they say 4 or 5 day shipping, I got mine in two days.  if you have some intelligent lighting such as moving fixtures, this will work.
