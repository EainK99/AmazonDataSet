So far, this gig bag is working out very well for my 88 key Yamaha P-115. I am a woman in my 50s, and I wanted to be able to transport the keyboard on my own without too much additional weight. Although I considered semi-rigid cases as well as cases with wheels, I needed a case that was lightweight and compact so that I could lift the keyboard in and out of the trunk or back seat easily as well as get it in and out of my house (including stairs). The rigid cases and the ones with wheels were both bigger and heavier. This bag is lightweight but seems very sturdy. The straps inside are very well cushioned and support my keyboard in place. I like that there are some rubber footings on the bottom of the case so that when you put the case down, it is resting on on those rather than the fabric.  I can just fit the music stand into the larger front compartment. My only reason for four stars is that I would have preferred the smaller front compartment to be fabric rather than netting. In addition, although I find a shoulder strap too heavy for me to use. I think it would have been nice to have, especially when someone is carrying the bag for me.
