Love the design and absolutely makes it easier to finger pick.  I'd give it 5 Stars but I found that the material it is not very durable & is already starting to fray after playing with it a few times.  I like the design of the shark-tooth pick though & it is comfortable to play with.  Just needs to be made out of some tougher material that will last longer.
