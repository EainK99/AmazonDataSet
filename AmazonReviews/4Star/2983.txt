For those of you considering getting into vinyl, I suggest this turntable to start out with. It is a great, out-of-the box turntable. I know so-called audiophiles might disagree, but for the everyday person this turntable sounds just fine. I've had guests over while playing LPs and they were quite surprised when they found out that they'd been listening to vinyl the whole time. My only complaint is the lack of shock absorption in the base. Heavy feet can make it skip.
