Decent cheap suspension mic stand, is able to support an AT 2020 (USB) with a pop filter on the arm. However, you should be careful that the part of the arm the holds the mic doesn't get loose by its nut screws, otherwise your mic could drop from it after slipping. Make it tight with a wrench so it doesn't fall out so easily. Otherwise, it is a good first time suspension boom scissor arm mic stand.
