My guitar cases last for decades but I burn through handles regularly. Using a rope tied to the connector wasn't cutting it so I looked far and wide for a handle and found the Grover on Amazon. Installation took about 1 minute. If you can bucket your belt, you are already a master handle installer!<br /><br />I own an old Grover handle from the late 1980s. It's still going strong on an ancient Ramirez guitar case. It has thicker leather and a metal reinforcing strip backing the leather where it attaches to the guitar case. This newer design still uses quality leather but lacks the metal strip and probably won't last as long as the old handle. Oddly, the Grover packaging and graphics look like they were designed during the 1950s so that part hasn't changed. All in all a nice handle but at $20, a bit pricy. Of course, while writing this review, I noticed the Amazon price had dropped to $16...
