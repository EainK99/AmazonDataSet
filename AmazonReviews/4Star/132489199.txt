It's a cheap laptop stand, and I didn't expect much, but I am impressed with what I got. This stand can be assembled in several different heights, and by using extension studs, can be made wider or narrower, depending on how you want things set up. I bought mine for photography work, where I can have my laptop up top and a small printer underneath.<br /><br />Everything goes together in a matter of minutes, but I wasn't able to torque down the support bars hard enough to keep the whole thing from wobbling slightly. It's not enough for me to return it or even worry about my laptop falling over, but it'd be nice if it were sturdy.
