i initially bought these because i planned on using them for little pa speakers and was gonna plug a mic into them. but when i received them, i realized that there isnt any input for a mic. i purchased a cable that had a headphone jack on one end along with them, so even though i cant use them as pa's, i plugged them into my tv so they make great speakers. ANYWAYS, with all that said, just in case you're in the same state of mind i was and are planning on using these as pa's, dont make the same mistake i did.
