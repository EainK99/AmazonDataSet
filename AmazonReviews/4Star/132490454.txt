Made it through airline baggage handling four times with nary a scratch on it (maybe the baggage handlers were being careful).  TSA latches a huge plus.  Only negative is I wish it had an internal compartment with a lid to keep picks, tremolo arm, strap, tuner, etc. in.  It does have two open inertial compartments.  Works great with Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars (I travelled with both).
