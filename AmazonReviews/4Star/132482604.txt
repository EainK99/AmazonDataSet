Keeps my guitar and ukulele perfectly in tune.  It must rely on vibration as it will not work if it is not clipped on to your instrument.  Another short fall, though many will not play their guitar in this mode, is that I could not tune my guitar in drop D or double drop D.  I had to use other resources (youtube) to do this.
