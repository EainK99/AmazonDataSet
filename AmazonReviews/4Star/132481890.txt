This is the same foam as you'll find used as inserts to many professional camera and equipment cases. It doubles use as a foam insert for a camera case or as acoustic foam. Place this around a microphone and it will effectively reduce the amount of room echo that is reflected back into the mike as you speak. While normally the smell of such a product is not something noticeable, the chemical aroma of this material definitely overwhelms you when you open it. It does not seem to dissipate much as days go by. I have no basis to determine if it is harmful, but plastic out-gassing is rarely anything good.
