The set is of good quality but the crowning tool was disappointing. It will take the peaks off the frets before it touches the sides, if it touch the sides. It did not for my Fender. My frets seems to be getting bigger, (optical illusion), when I noticed that the fillings from the fret wire were in the valley of the tool instead of on the sides. I was seriously upset about that. I was able to level the frets easily enough with the level guage, sold seperately. With that I was able to get my neck in the proper position for leveling. The fret level guage was helpful with finding the \\"buzzers\\".  But, I will get the tried and true crowning tool to do any more crowning work.
