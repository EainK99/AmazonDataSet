I bought this to replace a Nady 6&#34; pop filter. The Nady is the sturdier of the two, with a long steel attachment arm and a heavy duty steel ring. And that was actually the problem; I bought a Rode Podcaster and a Rode PSA1 desk mount arm to go with it, and with the Nady filter attached the mic was just too heavy for the arm's tension and it would constantly sink down. This filter is considerably lighter, and the smaller clamp is also easier to attach to the Rode shock mount.<br /><br />If you're looking for the best quality pop filter, buy the Nady. But if weight and bulk are factors, this is a great choice.
