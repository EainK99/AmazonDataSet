I'm a pianist and saxophone player, so I thought that melodica/melodion/pianica instruments might be just the ticket for more portable participation. After consulting melodicaworld.com, I selected the M-32C (it is important to specify precisely as there are less professional Suzuki melodions available). It is a quality instrument and I am having fun. The only reason that it did not get a full five stars is that the intonation is a bit off. While overall it's tuned to 441 which is probably a good spot, it has a bit of variation. The good news is that these can be adjusted (after a break-in) period by anyone with basic mechanical skills...it's not as hard even as adjusting an accordion. In the meantime, I'm having fun breaking it in, and looking forward to get it straightened out soon. You can see the tuning on it here:<br /> http://www.melodicaworld.com/forums/topic/tuning-standard/page/2/#post-5713
