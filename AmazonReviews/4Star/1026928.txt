The unit itself is solid and well built, all the knobs and switches have a very high quality feel to them, especially the monitor output volume knob.  I keep it just to the right of my mouse, so I can reach over and make drastic or minute adjustments as easy as can be.  The reason I got this unit was because the other interfaces I've used which didn't have balanced outputs caused an unbearable high pitched whine in my sensitive studio monitors.  You could literally hear the CPU and hard drive activity of my computer through them.  With the balanced outputs of this unit, that problem is completely alleviated.  Dead silence when I turn the volume down.<br /><br />However, it's not perfect.  Occasionaly, it will cut out on me, especially when switching between several different applications that are all playing (or are capable of playing) sounds, and won't work again unless I unplug the USB cable, wait a few seconds, and plug it back in.  You'd think this would be a deal breaker, but honestly, I've never owned a pro audio interface that didn't do this.  Seriously, Echo Audio's Mona with a PCI interface, Stanton ScratchAmp 2 with firewire, Focusrite USB, ProjectMix IO, and this unit have ALL done this to me.  And this is on multiple different PCs, different OSes, different everything.  And I'm no PC noob, either... I've been a Systems Administrator for over 15 years.  I'm highly suspicious that Windows' audio system just isn't designed to deal with multiple multi-channel interfaces well at all.  Hey, at least it's better than PulseAudio under Linux.  Good luck getting that one to cooperate.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend it.
