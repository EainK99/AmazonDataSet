Some good news and bad news -- first the bad.  I ordered this for my daughter's birthday.  The first one that we received worked fine for about a half dozen songs, and then stopped playing.  The display showed &#34;OP&#34;, meaning &#34;CD door open&#34;.  It was frozen in this mode despite repeated opening, closing, turning the unit on and off, etc.  Unfortunately my daughter had waited a couple of months before using it, and so I could no longer return it through amazon (30 day limit).  I contacted the manufacturer, and they agreed to fix or replace it for free under warranty.  I needed to take a photo showing the problem to include with the return.  When firing the machine back up to do this, it started working again.  So, I let the manufacturer know it was now working and I wouldn't need to return.  And then it started doing the same thing again after another dozen songs or so.  I contacted the manufacturer again, and after some haggling over who was responsible for the return shipping cost, they agreed to cover everything and emailed me a UPS return shipping label.  I returned the unit, and a new one was received within a couple of weeks.  And now, the good -- in addition to getting it replaced at no cost to myself, the new unit has (knock wood) so far worked flawlessly.  It's nice and compact, and easy to take over to a friend's house to use.  Sound quality has been good for a unit in this price range.  We had a second microphone already available to use - if you don't, you may want to consider buying the model that comes with two microphones.  In reading other reviews, my impression is that overall this is a very good karaoke machine in this price range,  but quality control at the factory is less than ideal and quite a few &#34;lemons&#34; come through.  Be wary of a bad unit and ready to send it back for replacement if needed, but otherwise this is a good buy for an inexpensive, portable CD-G karaoke machine.
