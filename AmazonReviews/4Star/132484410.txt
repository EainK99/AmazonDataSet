And I like it.<br /><br />For its price, this is an effective way to split a headphone signal four ways and not lose volume. The quality is ok, not great, and I'm sure some people would think it's bad. For the sake of this review, I'm thinking along the lines of the sound quality compared to the price. You get what you pay for. It's really that simple.
