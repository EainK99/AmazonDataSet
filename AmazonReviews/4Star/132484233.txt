cheaper than a Jaspo0rt backpack, this bag does the job and does it well. Has individual sleeves for each cymbal (by sleeves I mean thin sheet of synthetic nylon). Straps look like they'll last a while, shipped fast. Wish it had padding at the bottom. I set it down and think I damaged the cymbals... wasn't expecting them to just rest on the floor. Not well designed on the bottom. Hihat pouch is handy. comes with caribeaner, not sure why. Zildjian got a deal on caribeaners and just threw one on there for no apparent reason, maybe should have padded the bottom instead?
