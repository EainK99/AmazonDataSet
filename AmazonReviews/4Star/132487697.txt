I like that the rod is plastic so that it doesn't scratch the slide from the inside and that the fuzzy hair<br />on it is integrated in the plastic rod so that it doesn't come apart when inside the slide. I don't however like<br />its price for something that didn't seem to durable. However with other cleaning rods they cant clean the<br />entire slide so definitely worth the money.
