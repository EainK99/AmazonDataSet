I love this violin!  I'm teaching myself to play...with a little help from YouTube ; ). I had to have it restrung after I attempted to tune it myself. It wouldn't stay tuned but I found out that the knobs needed to be pushed in further and that the strings should only be adjusted one direction. Well... I'm learning...  After I had someone who knew what they were doing put new strings on it and adjust the tightness of the knobs it's a fantastic instrument!  It stays tuned and sounds wonderful...that is when I play it correctly. I reviewed several others but chose this one as a beginning player, but a seasoned musician.
