The sound quality and versatility are great.  There is only one drawback:  please fix the power supply.  It's twitchy.  You have to jiggle the cable in the back after flipping the on-off switch to get power to the unit.  The first Joemeek One Q2 I bought had this problem.  I took it back and exchanged it for the same model.  The second one had the exact same problem.  If mine were mounted in a closed rack with other effects, it would be impossible to turn it on, because I could not fit my hand around the back to jiggle the power cable.  Fortunately, mine is on a shelf.  I'll keep it, but once the two-year warranty I bought expires, I'm unscrewing the power supply to see if I can fix it myself.
