Recently bought this cable to connect my digital keyboard to a &#34;refurb&#34; sound bar - also purchased from Amazon.  The sound bar was defective so I'm not sure how the cables really worked.  But I can say that the &#34;external&#34; quality seemed good.  They looked well made - I wish I could have heard whether they actually worked with my keyboard or not.
