My husband and I bought this cello for our son who was beginning to play.  The sound is good, but we had to purchase new strings for the instrument.  The reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars...The first cello we received had severely damaged wood which did not happen during shipping, leaving us to ask why would they ship a broken cello?  However, once we notified the company, they had a nice new cello here within a few days!  Definitely a good cello for beginners, my son loves it!
