Actually, this will probably sound crazy ... but these days ... bad people tend to TAKE things that don't belong to them. And b/c I live in a sort of high-crime area I've placed them inside my new out-door planters to act as an ALARM ... to make NOISE ... if and when someone tries to TAKE my new planters. So, I will append this if and when it happens.
