I've had my 7506 SONYs for 13 years now. They're efficient (My ipod has enough power for them), comfortable, and they don't fatigue my ears. HOWEVER, if you're going to use the headphones for producing/mixing music or video  please be aware that these headphones are not neutral, THEY ARE BRIGHT - meaning they add a lot of high end (treble/presence) to everything and if you don't adjust your mix accordingly you'll end up with very dark mixes (not enough treble/highs).  You'll have to play your mixes on lots of different sets of speakers to make sure your mix sounds good (you should do this anyway) or compare the sound of your mix against other CDs through these headphones (if you're only using these headphones) to make sure your mix sounds as bright as the others.<br />  Don' let the brightness scare you though. You'll be spending a LOT more to get a set of (sufficiently powered) neutral \\"reference\\" headphones to mix with if you go another route.  Just be aware of the brightness. These are a bargain and they're a real industry standard for good reason (they aren't a mixing standard, however).<br />  Another issue some folks nitpick about is that over time the vinyl on the ear cups may disintegrate or flake off. This doesn't affect performance or comfort, but you can replace them or re-cover them if needed (mine show some wear but i've never noticed or been fussed about this).
