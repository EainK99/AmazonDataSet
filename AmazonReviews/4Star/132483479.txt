I needed something bright for a particular job, these strings are my &#34;go to&#34; strings when I need something relatively inexpensive and I'm going to be needing a bright string. Sounded just fine on my Lakland 55-02, will buy another set of them again when needed. Only four stars because GHS quality control could be better.
