I don't have a ton of cabinets to store musical instruments in. I don't even have much space to lay them all. But these racks work great, take up nearly zero space and are super soft so they won't damage the finish or anything.<br />They did smell like they came straight out of the mold. But I left them out in the (Texas) sun for a day and they're pretty much innocuous now.<br />So they're cheap (You already knew that) and they work. I'm tempted to get a few more stringed instruments now and maybe fill up a the whole wall.
