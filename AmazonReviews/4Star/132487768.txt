The picture displayed shows the Hand Microphone option; but this is clearly the Body Pack System as the item headline clearly states. Not showing the Body Pack Transmitter (roughly the size of a pack of cigarettes, just a bit thinner) is a major disservice.  The description is also rather generic - the system could have a hand-help OR body pack microphone.  The foam in the box supports both as well.<br /><br />Fortunately, I had a hand mic that easily plugged into the body pack transmitter. I am very happy with the quality and range - we use it for Side-line Football reporting on our high school broadcasts.
