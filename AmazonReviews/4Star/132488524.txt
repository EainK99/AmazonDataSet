Looks decent.<br />I ordered the one for a 2-12\\" even tho I own a 1-12\\" Fender Mustang III, thinking that I would use the extra space to put my pedals, wireless etc...and I could do away with my folding amp stand.<br />I did not realize that the handle for your amp would be the handle you would be using to pick it up and down with :-(<br />That is my fault for not investigating more than I did.<br />It is not insulated, so I plan on putting foam in it as well.<br />I think it will work fine for me as I intended it to.
