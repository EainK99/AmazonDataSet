These picks are awkward and weird unless you hold them upside down and rake them on the strings to get that percussive attack thing The Edge does. If that's what you're looking for, get these. I think they make them in another shape. One less oblong. I'd actually get those if I were you. Less weird. But again, these do that thing.
