I purchased a wireless MIDIJet Pro as a pre-installed part of my Zendrum MIDI percussion instrument.<br />Though it is incredibly expensive, I am highly impressed with its performance and longevity on battery. There is almost no lag (the system adds perhaps 3-4 milliseconds to latency overall). I have yet to encounter a situation where I ran out of range while using the system.<br />Two AA batteries power the receiver and provide it with a long lifetime.<br />The only disappointment I had with the system is that the battery compartment is poorly designed and the battery cage is loose inside the compartment. It should have been secured better so that it would not rattle around and perhaps cause damage to the internals of the unit.
