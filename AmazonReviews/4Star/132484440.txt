At first, I was disappointed with this bow, because it had synthetic strings rather than horsehair. But try as I might I could not find anyone who had horsehair bows in stock, so I was stuck with this one, which is identical to the one I got with my Stringed Psaltery from Lark of the Morning in California. The horsehair has more tooth, it is better in producing a tone. To satisfy myself, I bought some violin bows of horsehair, but they are entirely too long. I had also gotten the violin bows because there was no way to adjust the tension on the Psaltery bow. But I pushed on. I then discovered using the rosin and all fears about tooth and tightness disappeared. The Psaltery and bow were now in sync with one another, and I was happy<br /><br />The finish on this bow is very nice, a darker brown, not the blond I find on so many instruments these days. There is a way to tighten the threads on the bow. But I am not adventuresome enough to try, as there seems to be remarkably little forgiveness in the design.<br /><br />For all but the most accomplished professional, I recommend this bow (and get lots of rosin.)
