This isn't plug and play. You need to be able to strip wire and screw it down.<br />Watch your polarity.<br /><br />The adjustment of brightness has very fine control.<br /><br />I'm moving into RGB dimmers to separately adjust face, hair and backlight.<br /><br />However for a basic dimmer, it is great!
