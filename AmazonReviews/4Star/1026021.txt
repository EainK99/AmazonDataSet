Not a bad sound from a small speakers. I use them for small functions and they work great. Love the bluetooth, i hook it up to my phone or my ipad and listen away. We mostly use the speakers for outdoor movies and have to say the sound is really good, just need to get a portable sub for the bass and i will have full quality movie sound.if your thinking about this unit for amall functions, then get it. Not for a dj or large events.
