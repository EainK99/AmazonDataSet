I purchased this horn to try my luck with a soprano. I have been playing for 25 years mostly on my King Super 20 tenor. The horn was definitely playable out of the box with a few minor intonation problems with were easily fixed with a professional mouthpiece.  I would definitely purchase again because of the price and easy playability.
