It is a good karaoke system. It is compatible with the phone, CD/DVD, and computer. The speakers are good as we also sometimes play songs on it. It has two microphones and individual controls. But there is a humming or a buzz when you sing in the microphone. If you don't mind that it is good, also easy to handle.
