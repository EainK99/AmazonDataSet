I bought this item as a gift but I of course had to tune it and try it out before gifting it away.  The uke was surprisingly lightweight...I originally thought it came with a carrying case or something besides the cardboard box in which it came...that was disappointing.  Other than that, the uke came with very high quality strings already strung, a handy chord sheet, and the mahogany finish felt much  more expensive than what I paid for.  I did a lot of research before finally settling on this product, and I hope it is durable and has a good life making people happy with its quirky sound.
