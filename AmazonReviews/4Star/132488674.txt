Like many others, I read the stellar reviews of the SM7B.  I blindly purchased and although I can see why broadcasters would use it, I wonder how many pop/alt vocalists actually do.  It's a dynamic mic, so I compared it to my workhorse live/studio mic the Shure 58A.  There's no comparison, the 58A is powerful.  The SM7B sounds faint and actually took away from my voice rather than enhancing.  Then I compared it to my Gauge ECM-87 (a replica of the Neumann U-87)...still nothing.  I have a thinner voice, so that might be it, but I urge anyone interested in purchasing it to try it....preferably on a mix of their own music.<br /><br />Above is the original review.  To be fair, I have to add:  I was in a situation where I could not use a condenser mic due to a weird low rumble around where I live.  So, I said, OK SM7B...one more chance.  The song was very \\"pop\\" with lots of drums and heavy base line and I had to really belt out the vocals.  The SM7B allowed me to put the song down in a single take that day.  So, definitely one for the microphone locker.
