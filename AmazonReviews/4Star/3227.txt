Once assembled this is the perfect guitar stool.  Nice padded seat.  However the instructions for assembly are totally useless making the assembly process very difficult.  It's sad that Gibson would build the perfect stool and then make it next to impossible for those of us without engineering degrees to put it together.  Please Gibson rewrite the instructions.  Still a great stool.
