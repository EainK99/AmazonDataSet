The sound quality in this is WAY better than I expected, and I'm shocked that the strings haven't broken because we've adjusted them several times (including our four-year-old son \\"tuning\\" the guitar by tightening the strings as much as he can). Our almost 2 year old has strummed it too, without damaging it at all. I think other reviewers are right that this is technically a ukulele, but my daughter doesn't care about that distinction, and neither do I. :)
