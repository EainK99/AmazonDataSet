I bought this guitar to use in the various \\"lively\\" bars where I play regularly, I have a Gibson ES345 which is too expensive to risk. The Epi was playable from the box, I agree with the comments about rough frets,although not a serious problem, and IMHO acceptable at this price level.A couple of other small adjustments were necessary to suit my taste. The action is now very low, no rattles. The strings were a disappointment, feeling cheap and unpolished on the bass strings. Once changed, the feel improved tremendously, as did the guitar's response - acoustically, a nice ringing tone. I chose the natural version, and it has attracted much favourable comment. Only one small blemish, in the binding at the end of the neck, which incidentally is quite fat, although not uncomfortably so, around the lower frets, unlike the Gibson. Plugged in, the guitar performed well, givng a wide range of tone from mellow jazz to country twang and distorted rock leads, where I was pleased to note a lack of squeal from the pickups. Coil taps were<br />useful, giving a clear bright sound in contrast to the fatness of the humbuckers. All in all, excellent value for money
