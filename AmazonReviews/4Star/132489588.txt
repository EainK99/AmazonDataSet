Pros:<br />- Bright lights<br />- Customizable<br />- Great Fade effect<br />- Plenty of colors<br />- 3M tape is decent<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Confusing instructions for programming remote<br />- Somewhat pricey<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br />This LED Strip is definitely of high quality. They are bright (adjustable) and very colorful. It was a great addition for my homemade computer desk. I will try to upload a photo later. The only gripes I have are the instructions and price. The instructions are poorly worded/bad grammar. I haven't figured out how to program the custom settings on the remote because of how confusing they are! The price isn't bad, especially for this quality, but there are some cheaper ones out there (although probably not as good of quality). I would definitely recommend this product.<br /><br />&#34;So why 4/5 stars?&#34;<br /><br />Well, it would actually be 4.5 stars or so. I don't give products 5 stars when they have some bigger cons. These have two somewhat big cons (the instructions more so). I dislike it when people give a product 5 stars when it has cons. Doesn't matter how satisfied you are with it. Cons are cons and need to be reflected so. 5/5 Stars means the product is perfect. A 4 star product is actually pretty decent when it comes to rating, obviously it's portrayed differently to how people actually rate.
