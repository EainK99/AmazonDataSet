That's what she said!! Just kidding. Seems like a nice filter. A lot bigger than I was expecting. I bought it to use with my microphone when I do voice overs and when I'm making mix CD's.. I like to pretend that I'm a DJ and I add comments to my music. I had purchased a slip over foam filter which did a good job of stopping the popping sounds, when I tried this filter with foam filter it did make a difference. I have to hold it in front of my mike because it is way too big to clamp on but still a good product.
