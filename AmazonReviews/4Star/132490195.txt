I use it only to record vocal/acoustic demos.    By setting it according to other reviewers' advice, it works very good (in Windows 7, right click speaker icon> recording devices> USB microphone> properties> custom tab> uncheck AGC> levels tab> set at 20> press ok). Also, because of electrical interference, I unplug my laptop, and turn off the desk lamp.    There is still some tiny residual electrical noise, and what sounds like tape hiss, but it is so low it's not enough to be a problem.
