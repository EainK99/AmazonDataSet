I got 8 of these guitar wall-mount hangers. I put the first one up, using the screws and drywall anchors that came with them. I then gave it a little tug before putting a guitar up. One of the two screws bent in half, and the other anchor came right out of the wall. I went to the hardware store and spent $8 more on some real anchors and screws, and now all 8 of my guitars and basses are hanging on the wall. The only other comment i have is about the &#34;fits all size guitars, basses...&#34; My 12 string Les Paul (off brand) barely fits. I'm sure there are guitars with a slightly wider neck that would not fit.
