One of the best bangs for the buck I've ever purchased. I already have the heavy tube amp and the big multi-effects modeling rig.  Sometimes I just want to grab and go, plug and play.<br /><br />The Fender Mustangs do a better job modeling and give you the deep editing for a few $ more. 4 modifiable presets vs 30. But, I just wanted to dial in clean, crunch, and lead tones that will cover 80% of what I like to play and switch between them. More playing, less knob twisting and computer editing.<br /><br />It's small enough to hide beside the bed. Quiet enough to play while family watch TV in the next room. Loud enough for a reasonable band practice. You can also mic in to the pa and get all the volume your band needs.<br /><br />In a practice situation it sounds close enough.<br />It could work for recording a quick demo.  Lay down the tracks and get on with your day. If you need that authentic tone go elsewhere.
