I'm not a violin aficionado so I can't attest to it's quality but it suits my 12 year old who is starting his second year in practices.  From everything I researched online this has all of the parts necessary for at least a decent setup: ebony tailpiece, pegs, etc. and the standard maple body.<br /><br />My son had an issue with one of the micro-tuners where the &#34;needle&#34; came down beside the hinged &#34;lever&#34; and bent it and the rest of the micro-tuner metal casing sideways.  I was able to fix this by taking it apart and bending the pieces back in place.  I believe this happened because he loosened all of the strings enough that the bridge was allowed to move off-center and was pulling all of the strings at the fine-tuners to the side, slightly-but enough.  So when he proceeded to tighten them the tuning needle landed just off-center of the tuning lever and pushed it aside rather than pushing it down.<br /><br />My point being is that the metal micro-tuners aren't made of very heavy-duty metal (whether they are supposed to be or not) and my son learned that night he had to take care when fiddling (no pun intended) with his instrument.  So your take away from this case-study can be: 1. &#34;this violin seems low quality&#34; (which it is) or 2. &#34;this is a good price-point for a kid just learning to play and who may break something more expensive&#34; (bingo).<br /><br />With all of the parts, the handy case (with back straps!), the digital tuner, extra strings, etc. I feel I made a good purchase.  And before you start looking at the $60 violins take my advice - don't go so cheap that it makes learning frustrating (doesn't stay in tune, breaks too easily, etc.)  This is just quality enough that it's fixable and worth fixing and stays in tune after the requisite &#34;breaking in&#34; of the strings and other parts.
