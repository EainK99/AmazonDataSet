The unit needs a 9 volt battery to operate, and powers on while the cords are in, so if you are using this in a pedal board or something you'll need to remember to pull out the cords.  Plugging into external power would be recommended, and the Boss PS-120 seems like overkill.  But, very solid unit, works great, can be switched between latched and unlatched so real flexible for applications, and it locks to other units or older single foot switches which allows a nice, low profile series of switches.
