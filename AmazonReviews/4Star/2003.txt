Works great for charging our keyboard. The only issue we have is the cord is SUPER short. We have to plug it into an extension cord and then into the wall in order to use it. Otherwise, it gets the job done and lets our daughter practice her keyboard lessons by keeping the keyboard charged without pesky battery changes!
