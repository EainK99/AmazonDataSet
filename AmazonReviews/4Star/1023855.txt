These clamps are excellent for lightweight microphones, such as a condenser, but if you are planning on using an SM57 or a heavy Audix, skip these and go for something more robust.<br /><br />I purchased four of these because our drummer had a mishap that left him without a mic at a recent gig. The actual clamp he uses is about 30 bucks for ONE.  I went this route thinking it would work in a bind at least.  It fulfilled that duty and I believe I got my moneys worth.<br /><br />They mount securely on the rim, but the mic clip itself lets heavier mics droop and slip out of them. We wrapped tape around one to keep it in place.  Not beautiful by any means, but again it worked...<br /><br />Bottom line - excellent design, just a little to flimsy.  Increase the grip of the clip, use a harder plastic or more of it and I will give this 5 stars, and for the money, I should give it five stars anyway, just didn't want to mislead anyone!
