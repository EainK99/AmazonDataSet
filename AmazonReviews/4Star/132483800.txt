Looks great, solid feel, nice &#34;carpet&#34; finish, holds my equipment just fine. Only thing is I have ot put it on a little table in the studio so it's at an appropriate height when I'm at my desk. I use this to rack my interface and preamps so I need access to them while at my desk, so just think it may take up some space at your desk since it is not on wheels and is really low to the ground.
