So i just received this in the mail, got excited and played for ten minutes, and i've been playing for about 5 years now, and this is the greatest toy i've ever gotten for myself. Its great in a bedroom or a guitar like myself, but its a toy not a real amp, plug in, and just play! if you set everything to 12 on the amp, and go over the pickups on your guitar it makes some funny noises, and you control them with the tone knob if you have one. Its a good thing to have when your on the road, but just to be clear, its has a weird sound, but if you just want to go out with beloved electric guitar, then go ahead and buy this like i did!!
