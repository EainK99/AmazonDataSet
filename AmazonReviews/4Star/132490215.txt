Pros:  The sound is great, and they are very comfortable, even after several hours of continuous use.  They are sturdy, but light, and the fit is adjustable.  My only concern is that the fabric covering the foam feels very thin, and I worry about how well it will hold up over time.<br />Cons:  The cord is not detachable, and is very long, which is great if you need a long cord for studio use, but cumbersome for personal use.  This is easy enough to solve by cutting the cord short and attaching a new end, but a detachable cord would be nicer.
