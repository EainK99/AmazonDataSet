I love this guitar, the only thing that could be improved is the &#34;feed back&#34;.  or may be I need to change the setting to my amp.  I just got it too.  I am learning how to set it.<br />The sound is great, easy to play, light.  The finish is beautifully done.  The price is right for me, not too expensive for the quality.
