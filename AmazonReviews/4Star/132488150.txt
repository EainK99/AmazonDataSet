I got this hoping to attain the Roger McGuinn sound and it does a pretty awesome job.  This pedal sounds really really good on guitar, thought can be a little bit noisy.  It really does a good job of sparkling up a 6 string to the point of thinking it almost sounds like a 12 string.  I also was hoping this would work well for bass, and to some extent its decent for bass, but with controls only for attack and gain it can be difficult to dial in the right amount of compression for a 4 stringer.  Though i have to say that the low end still came thru loud and clear.  The 3 setting switch goes from dark-normal-bright.  I kept it on normal for both guitar and bass, but the bright switch was handy when i wanted to use the pedal as a boost box for solos.  I kind of wish i saved up for the super janglebox that has the boost pedal added and more controls.<br />I also recently purchased a Diamond Compressor -  which seems to be janglebox's main competitor for top of the line compression.  The Diamond is a more subtle beast and lends itself to more varied situations, but the Janglebox immediately gets the bright jangle of the Byrds that i wanted when i originally purchased the pedal.  I'll keep the janglebox for my guitar and use the Diamond for bass situations.
