I have just recently purchased this LED light strip package, and am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the materials inside. I was expecting the remote to be unreliable and finicky, but there is no issue I have become aware of.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Bright! (and dimmable!)<br />Flexible and easy to manipulate<br />Relatively small power and IR receiver components<br /><br />Cons:<br />Garbage adhesive strip (as others have mentioned)<br />Adhesive backing must be removed before using one's own tape because the backing paper is non-stick<br />Emits slight buzzing while emitting white light<br /><br />**Not necessarily a con, but something to be noted: TV remotes can trigger the light strip to turn on, change color, and strobe. My Vizio TV remote has caused all of these as will other remotes since they also give commands via infrared communication. Fun at times, but something I certainly did not think about before it happened.**<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with the performance and ease of setup for this product. The adhesive backing is where the biggest improvement can be made, but otherwise it's a great addition to my dorm room! Visitors have enjoyed the light show and ambiance the light offers.
