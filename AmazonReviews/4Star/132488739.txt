I broke my previous amp, and I wasn't ready to just spend another 200 for a bass amp, so I looked around, try to find something within 100 dollars and this along with other ones such as the fancy VOX with built in drum-beats came up.<br />I ended up choosing this one and I have to say, this is a really nice amp, it can get really loud (although people have said sustained loud volume will blow it) and the sound quality is comparable to the last one i owned (it was 150 dollars)<br />However, this amp does not have the presence knob as shown in the picture, there's only Bass, Middle, Treble, and Volume knobs, so keep that in mind, not that I care about the presence knob anyway, but i thought other people should know.
