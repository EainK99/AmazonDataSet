The good: 1. The tone is fairly good. Not full, kinda thin, but I still like it. The tone is somewhat comparable to a Special 20, but with less volume. 2. Phosphor bronze reeds are more durable than brass reeds, so I've read. 3. Made in America. 4. Construction seems pretty solid and durable. 5. Replacement reed plates are available. Unlike Lee Oskar replacement plates, the DF plates come attached to a comb. I don't know why. Cheapest price I've found for Lee Oskar reed plates is $18.99 and free shipping. Currently, the cheapest price for DF reed plates (and comb) is here on Amazon for $24.99 and free shipping. That's not bad.<br /><br />The bad: 1. No case is shipped with these harmonicas. Bummer! If you want to carry it around, better keep the box it came in, and the little info paper as well, so the harp won't rattle around so much inside the box. You can also (at least right now) purchase a Hohner Zippered Case here on Amazon for $5.96 and free shipping.  [[ASIN:B00H8AOKO2 Hohner Zippered Harmonica Case]]This is what I'm doing.<br /><br />2. It's just a little less airtight than some other harps, such as the Special 20 and Lee Oskar harmonicas I've played. This is minor though.<br /><br />The main reason I play this harmonica is because it is quieter than most I've tried. I have tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Most other harmonicas irritate my tinnitus more than this one, causing more pain.<br /><br />Next, I'll compare the DF to Hohner Special 20, Lee Oskar Major Diatonic, and Seydel Blues Session Standard since they are similar to each other in some ways, but different in others.  They are in the same price range, look similar, sound somewhat similar, and have black plastic combs which stick out further than the reed plates.<br /><br />Delta Frost vs. Special 20:<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, both Special 20's I own, one in C and one in A,  are more airtight than this harmonica.  SP20 does not have a comb that sticks out as far in the back, and I like that. I'm getting used to the DF's comb sticking out further in back, so this is a minor thing. The SP20 has brass reeds, which supposedly don't last as long as phosphor bronze reeds. Also, Hohner replacement reed plates can only be found on the Hohner site, and are $28.99 plus shipping charge (I don't know the shipping charge). Which has the better tone? That's a tough call. These two have a similar sound, I think.<br /><br />Delta Frost vs. Lee Oskar:<br /><br />Lots of harmonica players like Lee Oskars, but I don't. They are the most narrow harmonicas I've ever played.. uncomfortably narrow. Also, in my opinion, they do not sound good. And, the top cover plate, because of the deep engraving of Lee Oskar's signature, agitates my top lip. But, the replacement reed plates are cheap: $18.99 and free shipping. DF reed plates cost more.<br /><br />The comb of the DF sticks out a bit further in the back than the comb of the Lee Oskar. Other than that, I think the DF is superior to the Lee Oskar, except that the Lee Oskar I have is more airtight. The DF has phosphor bronze reeds instead of the brass reeds of the LO, and the tone of the DF is lots better, in my opinion.<br /><br />But, the Lee Oskar at least comes with a case. Not only that, the Lee Oskar cases can be attached to each other.. so no need to buy a separate case if you have many LO harps to tote around. Also, the LO reed plates are cheaper, and easier to get. You can probably even find LO reed plates at music stores, but are quite unlikely to find any Bushman products at music stores. Even so, I like the DF better than the Lee Oskar Major Diatonic. I find the DF to be more comfortable to play and I like the tone of the DF better than the LO.<br /><br />Delta Frost vs. Seydel Blues Session Standard:<br /><br />The BSS is thicker than most harmonicas, and longer. Its cover plates are uniquely shaped compared to other harps. Because of these factors, the BSS is awkward to play. Other than that, it is rather good,even though it has brass reeds, not phosphor bronze. The tone of this harp is rich and full. The BSS comes with a stupid little leather pouch instead of a case, which is a bummer. I'm buying a Hohner case for this one as well.<br /><br />In summary, this is a good harmonica, and I play it fairly regularly.  But, if my ears could better handle the sound certain other models, I'd be playing those more than this one. I think the Special 20 is better, but and the Seydel Blues Session Standard is just as good. But, the DF is better than Lee Oskar.<br /><br />Side note: For some reason I don't know, there are two harmonicas which are the same as the DF, except for the logo on the cover plates. The Suzuki Harpmaster (made in China, I believe, it being one of the cheapest in the Suzuki line), and the Soul's Voice harmonica, made by an American company called Buckeye Music, are pretty much the same as this harmonica.<br /><br />You can find the Suzuki Harpmaster on many sites (and it is cheaper than this one), but you can get the Soul's Voice only from Buckeye/Coast2Coast music online, or occasionally on ebay. The prices for these are similar. I decided to get a Bushman. It's a more well-known brand than Buckeye Music. Buckeye's Soul's Voice might be plenty good though.<br /><br />The Delta Frost harmonica is named after a late Bluesman named Frank Frost, who lived and performed in the area of the Mississippi Delta, where Blues music was born.<br /><br />If I remember correctly, the Bushman company is named after Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann, who is often credited as being the inventor of the harmonica.id little leather pouch instead of a case, which is a bummer.
