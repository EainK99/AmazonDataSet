So these under 20$ pickups are all the same. They work and they sound decent.  I put this on a hundred dollar Yamaha laying around at church. Someone said it sounded \\"stiff\\". I don't think it sounds worse than our low end Fender, next to our Taylor - yes - \\"stiff\\".<br /><br />Between a 20$ under saddle pickup (UST) and a 20$ soundboard transducer (AST) I would choose the AST - more natural sound - less stiff. Drawback to the AST is the finger squeak.<br /><br />So at 20$ I like it and now we have a backup plug-in acoustic that sounds as good as our Fender or Ibanez with name brand pickups.
