Mine is plenty solid and handles whatever I do with it. After about 1.5 years of use, no problem. I do suggest weaving your mic cables around the boom/stand though, because their weight will affect this thing. Also, instead of screwing this attachment on, undo the boom lock and spin it around in place. That tightens the mic-holder without adjusting its position, so you can 'fix' it even mid-take without screwing up your sound.<br />For the price, can't really beat it. Mine came with a free Euro-size adapter, too.
