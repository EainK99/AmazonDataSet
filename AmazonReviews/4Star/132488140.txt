It takes a while to get used to it, especially if the Spanish guitar is not the only guitar you play on a show.  You have to develop a pattern to set yourself up with the strap and the guitar and the same to take it off during instrument switching.  Since the strap only has one-point of support on the guitar, you must always remember that you cannot let go of the guitar.  You must always have one hand holding the guitar or the guitar will kiss the ground.  Once you develop this routine, it is a very handy and comfortable strap.
