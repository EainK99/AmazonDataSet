I read rating of products, especially these with low number of stars.<br /><br />I needed to replace my original 120 bass accordion straps. Looked on line, here and there, and decided to choose Hohner on Amazon. Good choice. Very soft on my shoulder, accordion feels to be lightweight, adjustable (little bit too much adjustment), my friend, also musician, tried them playing, and liked it.<br />Recommended. It is worth to buy Hohner, instead of other, questionable (maybe cheaper?) brands, with poor quality, where multi year usage can be marked with dissatisfaction.<br />Hope there are going to last 10-15 years (like an original ones).
