My son says it's not a keyboard because it doesn't have voices, but I wanted a digital piano, which is what it is.  I would say it's somewhat entry level - gives you a good feel for what a digital piano is without a huge investment - but it's nothing particularly fancy.  It has a good feel and pretty good sound.  It does have a number of different keyboard voices - organ, harpsichord (I think), etc., maybe even violin?  Has a good feel, touch (loudness based on how hard you hit - now I can't remember what this is called), although it certainly doesn't have the same range as a piano.  But I'm really enjoying it and I've been a purist for 45 years....especially that I can use ear/headphones and not care whether or not anyone else hears.
