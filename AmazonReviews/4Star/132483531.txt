I have been using a [[ASIN:B0002E56JY Remo RT0010-00 10-Inch Practice Pad]] which is great because it's made with a real (padded), tunable  drum head, but believe it or not, last time I was practicing in a hotel room I got complaints about the loud noise, so when I saw this I thought it would be quieter and very useful with its built-it meter-and-rhythm-adjustable metronome. It does feature a very nice drummer's metronome using three pitches of beeps. For example, on the 4/4 16th-note rhythm, the highest beep signals the 1-count, the lowest beep signals the 2, 3 and 4 counts and the mid-pitch beep signals all the \\"e-&-a\\" counts. I would have preferred the feel of a slightly livelier and \\"giving\\" rebound than that from this thin gum rubber pad, but it is good enough and very quiet.<br /><br />I like the stroke counting mode, not because I want to set any speed records but because I can test my ability to hold a particular tempo. For example, by default the stroke timer counts down from 30 seconds (you can set it to start from 5 minutes 5 seconds) so I can get a tempo of a quarter note = 100 bpm in my head and try to maintain that tempo for 30 seconds, meaning the counter should read close to 50 when it stops. If I'm playing 16th notes it should read 200, and so on.<br /><br />My one surprise disappointment was that for some reason I expected this pad to give me a synthesized drum sound when hit, especially when using the earphones. Probably the presence of a mini-stereophone jack as well as the fact that the unit obviously has an electronic drum trigger -- since it can count strokes -- made me think they would serve up at least a snare drum sound, but no. I mean they must have a chip for the beeps, right, so why not replace that with an old-fashioned YM2413 chip or some such for pennies a piece and get the beeps plus simultaneous percussion sounds triggered by the pad? Maybe they will listen to me and make that a part of their next model. As it is, using ear buds --not to mention headphones -- only makes the soft pad hits unsatisfyingly hard to hear, even at low volumes so I prefer to use the onboard speaker which is fine for beeps and can be set at a nice balance to the pad hits. However, the earphone capability will be very useful when using this unit simply as my metronome while playing my acoustic drums.<br /><br />I just received this product so I can't comment on durability, but it is solidly made. I wish the LCD were placed at an easier-to-read angle since the sequenced pulsing dots on that display are a helpful metronome feature. I can't fault the Ahead Metronome Practice Pad for not having a synthesized snare drum sound, since it never claimed to, but it would surely be a better value for the price if it did and if the pad had a more responsive feel, so I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.
