Everything good that has been said about it is true. Easy hook up, well constructed, works as expected. Impressive amplification for the little guy. I was also impressed that it has 2 rows of rubber on the outer edges to hold it in place. Even the bright blue LED doesn't bother me, well maybe a little. The LED's are quite bright on it, nothing a little black electrical tape can't hide. However, my only real complaint is there is no way to power it off without unplugging. As someone who religiously hides wires and tries to keep everything neatly organized this is a problem. I would have thought that if you turned the gain all the way down it would click off, but it doesn't. There is no power button. Even with no signal from turntable the thing stays active and bright. So that is why it isn't a 5 star product. There needs to be an easy way to power off instead of unplugging.<br /><br />Also, a few people have mentioned the ground connection isn't working. However, using my grounding wire from the turntable to the pre-amp's ground connection worked fine. Other's may just have a bad grounding wire.
