I have a small head, and I have to pull the headband ALL the way up to use this because the weight of it is so heavy it's hard on my neck.  Especially if you're working for long periods of time.  It does have very good sound quality, and I'm not sure how you could make these things more comfortable - to be over ear they have to be big, big means heavy I guess.  I don't trust blue tooth, I really wanted plug-in.  If you have neck issues, I'd say pay the extra money and get a more expensive pair that claims to be light weight.
