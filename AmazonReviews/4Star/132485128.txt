Its louder than I expected from something that this size, Its pretty clear and works well with my small room. I use it for monitoring purposes and I'm not disappointed. I must admit, I wish I had spent some extra cash and got the M-Audio BX5 D2, those are REALLY GREAT, a friend of mine let me preview his work on them and its louder than the AV40 by far! and clear and guess what... Its not that much difference in size!. Overall though, the AV 40 is good stuff that gets the job done
