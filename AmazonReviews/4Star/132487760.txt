This guitar is good in its price category. It's been a beater of mine for a good while, some things to note: the tele style headstock going on here, I personally really like. A lot of strat copies have these way aggressive heads just seems off to me, this has a cool old school vibe that compliments design. This guitar has a solid poplar body, you can like that or not, but it is wood rather than plywood etc. one thing I really like it is lightweight, I've got hefty alder and mahogany stuff I love the grab and jam feel of this, that's why it gets beat on, I got dings and rash and whatnot, but to me it looks relic-ish,<br />The black is worn through here and there, not that it came off easily... but plays like new and good. I've changed lots of parts over time out of preference, not that I had to, the original hardware is ok, just average but durable. Easy upgradable, I put in a bone nut, locking tuners, lefty fender made in Mexico bridge with full size block, all fit easy... to me made it totally stay tune and get action dead on etc. I got one of the loaded pickguards but didn't fit so I transferred the goods from it to my old plate and tada... Partscaster supreme. I have no problem not even having a strap on this that's how light it is.<br />Never had any fret buzz or dead frets etc. did polish the edges back when they weren't like poorly finished but a little less than perfect.<br />In all good guitar, learn as you go type thing, it's still at arms reach most times.
