Good tool for a piano enthusiast who doesn't mind doing a little piano maintenance.<br />A word to the wise...  If you mess this up it'll cost you big time.  You can get hurt or damage your piano.  Be careful<br />A must have for those of us with a less than perfect piano.<br />I use it to keep the low end in tune.  When the piano gets too honkytonk it's time for a professional.
