When rating this item, I'm taking the price into account. I might not be so generous if this cost 3x as much.<br />But as long as you know what you're getting, what it takes to install, and how your guitar will sound, this is a great product at a great price.<br /><br />The bad part is that this kit didn't come with a single bit of instruction. As another reviewer pointed out, a template would've been extremely helpful so you could tell where to cut, and where your screws would line up. This is important because there's not much space at all in between the hole you have to cut out of your guitar, and where the screw will go.<br /><br />After watching some youtube videos I decided I needed this [[ASIN:B0002JFMIO 6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper with Extra Battery and Case]]. It came in very handy for measuring the size of the tuner and pre-amp and transfering those dimensions to the guitar.<br /><br />I used a dremel with a heavy duty cut-off wheel to cut the opening in the guitar. I've seen videos of guys using just a drill and it just looked sloppy. The dremel was the way to go for me. Once installed, the screws were a bit off. The 2 on the bottom went right into the wood while the 2 top ones just went into the opening I had cut. A template would've really helped. If I had it to do over (and you only get one shot) I would measure a bit more carefully and maybe make the opening with 45 degree angles on the corners instead of square so that the screws have a better chance of finding wood. As it is, and since I didn't put it in an expensive guitar, it's good enough.<br /><br />Instructions would have also help me determine if the pickup had an orientation it needed to follow. i.e., should the thickest part of the pickup line up under the the thickest (low E) string? Does it matter? I don't know... but considering that the side the pickup wire comes out of would be closest to the tuner that you plug it into, that's what I did. I had to dremel the slot in the bridge down further so the saddle would fit back in. Not something for the faint of heart, but seemed to have worked out okay.<br /><br />The tuner itself isn't quite as helpful as I had hoped. It's not like my trusty [[ASIN:B003VWJ2K8 Snark SN-1 Tuner]], that finds the note you're picking. You have to pick the string you want to tune to - E, A, D, G, B, E, then tune, then move to the next note. Does the job if you don't have another tuner handy but I doubt I'll use this tuner at all as long as I have my Snark with me.<br /><br />The sound - be prepared for an electric guitar sound. Not knowing all that much about guitar components (live and learn though, am I right?), I was expecting an acoustic sound amplified. Sounds like a transducer pickup would probably have been the better option over this piezo pickup.<br /><br />But for this price, it's hard to complain about anything. The installation is not for anyone not familiar with basic wood working but I had no prior experience with guitar repair at all so it's not too bad at all.her so the saddle would fit back in.
