This is definitely a very unique set of strings - the combo of hard & normal tension has a certain sound which is .... pure class ! The bass strings are bold,well defined & bright while the trebles are silky sweet. Its a great combo for playing many kinds of music - classical, pop arrangements, neuvo flamenco etc. The trebles will never get bold or aggressive even with hard playing. definitely the most crystalline arpeggios & tremolos with these strings. Tonewise, I surely rate these strings higher than the standard daddario EJ45(cheap & convenient) which I was using.<br />The only drawback with these strings : TUNING PROBLEMS ! something is totally wrong with the material of these strings. they require more than a week to get into tune. Expect to spend the first week frustrated - the sound is beautiful, but u cant play anything cos it keeps slipping out of tune...aaargh ! even after 2-3 weeks of constant retuning, I still need to retune nearly every day(even if its a bit). This is where the daddarios always score- they maintain their tuning within 2 days & rarely need re-tuning.<br />My warning : go for these strings if u have a good recording in 7-10 days or if u only play at home.DO NOT use them if u have a critical gig or recording in the next 2 days. U will likely spend half your gig retuning them & come back frustrated.
