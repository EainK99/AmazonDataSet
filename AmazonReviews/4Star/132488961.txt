This is a no-frills pedal board. I gig very frequently and it has been very useful so far.  I was a little disappointed at the quality of the floor and the velcro provided. It didn't last long and I had to add a layer of velcro to the bottom of the board and my pedals to compensate.  All-in-all, a good product.
