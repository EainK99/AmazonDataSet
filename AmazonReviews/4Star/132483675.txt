I've played harmonica for over 50 years. I started playing golden melodies in the early 1990's. It's still my favorite harmonica. I've had several sydel 1847, suzuki manji, suzuki fabulous, lee oscar, hohner marine band, etc. I keep coming back to the golden melody. They're kind of a pain, if you drop one you'll likely have to reset the covers. If the cover gets knocked a little, the screw will be loose and fall out. But, I put up with it because I just like the feel of it, with the curved shape. They're a little stiff to bend, but they can be made to overblow nicely. Some people won't like them because they're tuned to equal temperment, of course you can retune them. I don't really recommend these for beginners, because they're stiff to bend, but for advanced players, you should try one.
