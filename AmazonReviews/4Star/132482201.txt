This is a great keyboard because it's my entire studio in one. I have faders, knob controls, trigger pads, etc. 49 keys is a perfect size for the producer who knows how to play the piano. If you just sample and mix, the 25 key or 31 key keyboard is a better option. A lot of people have had problems using the keyboard in Logic Pro X and Garageband. Update the drivers which you will find on the M-Audio website. There are also some great videos on YouTube that walk you through programming the keyboard. There is one by Sonic Lab that is about 12 minutes long that shows you how to program the keyboard. Once I watched those I fell in love with the keyboard even more.<br /><br />DRUM/TRIGGER PADS: The drum pads took some getting used to because I like the feel of the AKAI pads. The pads on the AIR are touch sensitive. Some times it's hard getting sound to come out of them in real-time. There is a delay. Updating the drivers will help as well as programming the keyboard. This is not an out of the box workable keyboard. It takes some setting up.  There are 12 pads in total with 3 banks to program sounds. Each bank has a different color that highlights around the keys so you know switch between the banks easily and know where you are.<br /><br />KEYBOARD: One of the reasons I like the axioms is because the keys resemble tradition piano keys. They are fully weighted keys. The keys are strong and can take strong playing especially if you're using it to play drums or you like to play into the keys. Some people complain that the keys are too springy. I did not find this to be the case at all. I have an electric baby grand style piano in my home and while the keys on the AIR are not as not as good as a grand the AIR feels the closest to my baby grand.<br /><br />THE BODY: The body is a nice design and it is a really solid body. It's heavier than I expected it to be, but it's strong and sturdy. The buttons and knobs are also pretty solid. I have had cheaper m-audio keyboards beforeand the knobs would just pop off. I've been pushing and pulling on the axiom air to see if they are solid and yes they are. There is a lot going on with this keyboard and this is my first all in one MIDI keyboard. I always had the components separate. I still have a lot to learn about programming it properly.<br />The back has a MIDI in and out, a sustain and express pedal, plus the USB port. The USB cable is long which I like.<br /><br />THE SOFTWARE: I was disappointed by Ignite. I'm not sure why it's useful, at least to me. I don't have a problem going into my DAW and recording quick ideas. I use Logic and I'm getting into Abelton Live and it's pretty simple to use. Plus I can sample tracks and I have a lot more instruments to play around with. I played around with Ignite for a while. I had a hard time getting any sound out of it. The volume was low even when I had everything turned up. Once I have the ideas down then what? Ignite also takes longer to load than Logic Pro X. I'm used to working in my DAW and never thought there was a problem recording ideas so I won't be using Ignite.<br />Pro Tools express is a nice touch but I can't get it to open. I don't know why. I'll keep trying. My iLok lights up when I put it in the USB but Pro Tools won't recognize it. It would be nice to try it. I have heard other buyers of the keyboard state that Express pales in comparison to the full ProTools and there is no need to have Express.<br /><br />Logic Pro X users: The entire keyboard will not work in Logic just yet, especially if your OSX is about 10.8.5. If you're on 10.8.4. you should be okay. If you are on Maverick forget about it. M-Audio has not released any updated and it almost seems like they won't for a while. The HyperControl function does not work at all and you cannot use the faders, knobs, and the play/stop buttons. The trigger pads and keyboards work fine.<br /><br />Ableton Live 9 users: The keyboard works great. Everything functions as it should.<br /><br/>If you're buying for the additional software, don't. That is no reason to buy this Keyboard. The software sucked. Just buy Pro Tools or Logic or whatever you use, even if it's Garageband. So that means you can buy these used at a lower price. But the keyboard alone is enough for any musician and producer. It is solid and professional.<br />Just a note: If you buy this in a store, carry the box carefully. I have never seen a more flimsy box in my life. It would never stay together and your keyboard will fall out of it.
