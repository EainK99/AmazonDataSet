This flight case arrived quickly and I've got no complaints.  My Terminal Mix 4 fits in snugly and is protected on all sides.  There is space for my Macbook Air under the controller as well as few spare cables.  The locking mechanism seems snug, although I do wonder how I'll get a TSA padlock on there for international travel.<br />Altogether, a well put together case.
