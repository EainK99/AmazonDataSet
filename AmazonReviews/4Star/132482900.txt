Going to the 'x' from the mrv m500 I don't know if it was worth it. Has variable subsonic filter that v does not. Has 50 more watts per impedance and stable to one ohm. But depending on your set up may not be necessary. Installer told me there is built in/ crossover to not worry about the sub 30 Hz frequency w/ the 'v' but it doesn't say that in the owners manual. If it does then the mrx was really not worth the extra money. Still good amp but overkill for me...
