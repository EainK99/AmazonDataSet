This is a pretty solid mic stand for the price! I decided to try this stand out before spending more money on a more expensive one and I am sure glad I did! I use a Samson C03U with a shock mount and it fully supports all of the weight without dropping at all. The clamp and knobs seem to do it's job and I can move and adjust it without any problems. I don't use the cable that it comes with since my mic uses a USB so I'll probably just end up cutting it off.
