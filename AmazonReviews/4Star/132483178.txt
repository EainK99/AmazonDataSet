i have the 5 guitar stand and this handles most of my instruments.  However, this 7 guitar is good and much better for slim solid body guitars as the slots for each instrument is smaller than the 5 unit models as far as the spacing is concerned.  it good, but don't expect to use this with hollow body instruments.
