Works well! Not overly powerful fan but just right for personal desktop use. I'm not sure how it keeps running after my computer goes to sleep. I've left it running overnight several times because I forgot to turn it off. Doesn't seem to be an issue as I've had it for a few weeks and still works fine. For the price seems to be a pretty good value.
