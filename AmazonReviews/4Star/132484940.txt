I use this to clip mics onto a drum kit for recording. It works great with Sennheiser e604s on toms/snare, and Oktava MK-012s on toms. Not so hot for an SM57 or an i5 on the snare top because it puts the mic too close to the center of the head and it gets in the way of the drummer's sticks, but it works fine for snare bottom. It's easy to lose the wingnut, so be careful with it. be gentle with the nylon threads or you'll strip it. Treat it right and it will treat you right
