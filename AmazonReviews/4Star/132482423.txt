I read reviews on several djembe stands, and decided on this one, the [[ASIN:B00BKWQ9AW Meinl Percussion Djembe Travel Stand]].<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B00BKWQ9AW Meinl Stand]] is a bit more flimsy than the [[ASIN:B000FIP3G8 REMO Lightweight Djembe Floor Stand]] would have been, but is quite a bit lighter and more portable.<br /><br />Disassembled, the Meinl Stand packs flat in its original, 2\\"-thick carton. If you have ever packed a van with a bandful of instruments and amps, you know how important that can be.<br /><br />Although you need to fiddle with the stand a little to assemble it (the last bracket is hard to line up), it is still easy to assemble. Once assembled, it is reasonably sturdy, and quite stable.<br /><br />The stand keeps the djembe sufficiently off the floor for a good sound. The tilt of the drum is limited to about ten degrees, but a stand that supports extreme tilt is quite expensive.<br /><br />I like the idea that the stand has a round base  (I am not a fan of tripod stands because they tend to have a wide footprint, get in the way of other stands, and are easy to trip over and knock over).<br /><br />The stand's six small pieces of rubber tubing around its rim protect the drum and prevent the drum and the stand from vibrating against each other.<br /><br />All in all, I think that I made the right choice of stand for my needs, preferences, and budget.
