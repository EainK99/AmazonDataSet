I've read the rave reviews regarding this bass for over 1-year.  I decided to take the plunge because I wanted a bass that is very light, (my Jazz bass is more than 10 lbs), one I could bang around, and one that was easy on my aging hands and fingers --what a pleasant surprise.  The craftsmanship for a bass at this price point is spot-on.  Initially it was tough getting the intonation to stabilize, but after playing it a couple of days it settled down.  The P pickup is better than the Jazz pickup, but I'm using it for that Jamerson Motown sound and to practice, practice, practice.  I went a step further and installed my favorite strings -- D'darrio Nickels (short scale version); it was an instant moment of bass sounding bliss.  Listen, it's incredibly tough to beat this instrument at this price-point; I bought the black one and thinking about a red one too so I will have one to &#34;hot rod&#34;!  Recommendation:  buy it; immediately change the strings and get a set up ; wax the body to preserve the paint job and enjoy, enjoy.  Be safe--be well.
