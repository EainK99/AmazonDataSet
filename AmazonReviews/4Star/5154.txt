I really like these Blues DeVille harmonicas. Most of the time, they sell for under $30. They sound fantastic.. loud gritty tone. They are airtight. I had no problems playing any of the notes, including the #2 and #3 draw notes, which are tough to play on some harps.<br /><br />These are heavier than some harmonicas, which some folks might mind, but I like the feel. These seem extra durable.<br /><br />These have cover plates with a matte finish, which will definitely feel different from the cover plates on most harmonicas. The finish is a little rougher on the lips than the usual cover plates you will find on most harps. The matte finish cover plates are less smooth. This is not a deal breaker for me, just bugs me a bit sometimes.<br /><br />These have a great resonance to them.. hard to explain what I mean by that.. while playing, they resonate, or vibrate more in my hand. This feels cool. Good sustain too. When I play a note and take my hand away, it's almost like I can still hear the note a bit, and can definitely feel the harmonica resonating more than most.<br /><br />The Blues DeVille has phosphor bronze reeds, which supposedly last longer than brass reeds found in harmonicas made by Hohner and Lee Oskar. Phosphor bronze provides a different tone than brass, which you may or may not like.<br /><br />I am not aware of any replacement reed plates being available for this harmonica. Some other brands, such as Lee Oskar and Bushman, sell replacement reed plates for their harps. Hopefully, the phosphor bronze reeds in this harmonica will last a long time.<br /><br />This harp is a little wider than the Hohners and lots wider than the Lee Oskars (which are too narrow, in my opinion), but not so wide that switching back and forth between the BD and other brands will be difficult.<br /><br />The plastic comb is fairly comfortable while tongue-blocking, though not quite as comfortable as the comb on the Hohner Special 20.<br /><br />You might be wondering how the Blues DeVille compares to the Hohner Blues Harp..<br /><br />BH has a thick wooden comb that is really really rough on the tongue when tongue blocking. Also, Blues Harps tend to require more air. They are not air tight. The BD is airtight. Blues Harps, unlike the Blues DeVille, do not have side vents, and are therefore quieter. Blues Harps have brass reeds.<br /><br />Both the BD and BH have reed plates that stick out past the comb. Both have reed plates that are sharp at the edges, so you'll have to be careful playing the lowest and highest notes.<br /><br />I've found the reed plates of the BD to be more comfortable and easier on the lips than the reed plates on the Blues Harps. However, the Blues Harp cover plates are more comfortable than the BD cover plates.<br /><br />I find the Blues DeVille to be far superior to the Blues Harp.<br /><br />But.. I've owned four Blues DeVilles, and three of them arrived with cases that were almost impossible to open, and therefore useless. Not cool, Fender!<br /><br />Also, I bought a Blues DeVille in the key of C. The first one I got shipped was defective. The #10 draw note was quite noticeably flat. I sent that one back. The second one in C was great. Key of A, and key of G both great, but only the one in the key of A came with a functional case.<br /><br />If it weren't for the case, I'd give this harmonica 5 stars. This one and the Hohner Special 20 (which is quite different from the Blues DeVille) are my two favorites.<br /><br />How are this one and the SP20 different?<br /><br />SP20 has smooth, comfortable reed plates. That harmonica also has a comb that sticks out further than the reed plates for extra comfort and no sharp edges on the ends of the harmonica. The SP20 comb feels a bit better (but only a bit) when tongue-blocking. It is a tiny bit easier to play single notes on the SP20. It is a lot lighter, but probably less durable. The SP20 has no side vents, and is therefore quieter. That harmonica also has a cleaner tone than the Fender Blues DeVille. I've found the SP20's to be a bit less airtight than the Blues DeVille. SP20's have brass reeds, which might wear out quicker than the BD's reeds. The SP20's I've bought all came with cases that work as they should, in other words, the cases open and close properly.<br /><br />So why do I play a BD as much as an SP20? I love the tone and feel (with the exception of the matte finish) of the Blues DeVille. Actually, most of the time, the matte finish doesn't bother me at all, and is an interesting change. I like having some variety. Since these harps look, feel, and most importantly sound different from each other, variety is what I get, by owning both.ne than the Fender Blues DeVille.
