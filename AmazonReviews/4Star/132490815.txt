Got this for my brother, a genius drummer, 9 years old. After changing the heads and tuning it right.. it is a steal for this price. After you mic this thing up...you would never believe you only payed this much for this piece. The cymbals are not good at all. It wont tear or bend, but sounds soo much like aluminum metal sheets. The throne is very poor quality. it broke by the second week.. remember a skinny 9 year old sit on it. :)
