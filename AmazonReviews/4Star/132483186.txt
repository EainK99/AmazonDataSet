I have ordered about 4 of these and returned 2.  The first one I ordered seemed to work great.  Very fast strobe and danced to the music.  However, when I ordered a second a few months later I noticed it did not strobe nearly as fast as the first and the stand was different.  Figured it was a different seller so different manufacturer and sent it back for a refund.<br /><br />When I ordered a 3rd from the same seller as the first, the laser again did not strobe as fast, but did have the same stand.  I was going to return since one of the knobs was touchy, but waited for a 4th to compare the two side-by-side.  I realized how much shorter the 4th's cord was and how it was a lot less bright and covered less area.  When I compared the 3rd product to the 1st I owned I then realized that the 3rd was much brighter and definitely covered more surface, but the 1st still strobbed way faster.  So I kept the 3rd (mega bright and large surface) and the 1st (mega fast strobe) and sent 2nd and 4th back for refunds.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with the 2 lasers I kept and they def. satisfy my needs.  For the price it is a good deal if you are willing to put up with some returning and comparing to get the best quality product available.<br /><br />Lessons Learned:<br />1) This product has MANY different manufacturers in China regardless of Seller<br />2) Pay attention to the length of the power cords as they may differ<br />3) Order many and compare the brightness / surface area as some are better<br />4) Compare the strobe speed at max strobe b/c some are much faster<br />5) Compare the speed know that controls the lasers movement as they may differ<br /><br />Suggestion:  Just buy like 4 or 5 and send the defective ones that you don't want back so you are completely satisfied.<br /><br />Hope this review helps!
