Bought this mic to record directly to the iphone and with the other mics I've used you always had to use some sort if interface or preamp to connect it to the iphone and after an Hour of fiddling around with the mic and it not working I was just about to give up and then decided not to use my pre amp with the mic, just an adapter to go from the standard tips leave to TSS and it worked great.<br /><br />So after a little reasearch I found out that it does this because it's an electret condenser, not a regular condenser. Worked out well though because you don't need any batteries to use it with an iphone and the audio quality is up there with the $100-200 mics I've bought for senheiser packs.  But the quality of construction is fairly low, that's why I gave it only 4/5 Stars. If your careful it should be ok though<br /><br />Overall absolutely amazing mic for the price, and for the price you could just order a few to keep around as backups!
