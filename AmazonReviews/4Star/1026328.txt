It's a bit tight, but I can get my Epiphone Les Paul in there okay.  Decent padding, but I wouldn't count on it saving a solid mahogony electric guitar if you dropped it from a few feet off the ground while unloading it from your car.  It will keep your electric in good shape if you aren't a klutz, though.  Hard to beat it for the price.
