All in all not a bad unit for the money. When i plug my phone in it has alot of interference. The fan is really noisy, and has a smell like burning electeonics. But it pushes my Nady 15s pretty good. My only problem is you should tell people they will need a phantom converter box to run a condenser mic because it doesnt have phantom power.
