After years of trying different sticks i have landed on the Vater 5B as my drumstick of choice.<br /><br />They are normally very dense and have enough weight to play off of. Occasionally there will be a matched pair that is a little on the light side for me in terms of density and weight, but for the most part, Vater has made me a very happy customer.
