What I enjoyed about this jack was that it had the tooth-like connections for the sleeve. I gave this a 4/5 stars only because the end piece (with the teeth connectors) is a bit flimsy. I highly recommend supporting it from underneath when making any connections. I used this jack for connecting an EMG-81 (solderless). The tiny connectors fit right over the teeth with a pair of needle nose pliers and a bit of jiggling/minute pressure. If you need a long type stereo jack, the 152B from Switchcraft is the one!
