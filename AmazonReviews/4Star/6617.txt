Nice high quality, some machining marks still buy I don't mind, doesn't match the rest of the black hardware on my bass (cheap Chinese stuff) but it blends in with the headstock. I'm using it on a 4 string that had trouble with the A string not having enough pressure over the nut, works wonderfully for that purpose although finding a place for it was difficult.
