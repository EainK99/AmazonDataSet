If you even play casually you will go through a lot of Saxophone Reeds. I believe these will last longer than most sax reeds, unless you move your mouth a lot, having a biting habit when you play, or are just really hard on reeds. I admit I tend to grip with my teeth sometimes with tough notes. These are less likely to splinter or crack in my humble opinion. These are well made. A great gift idea for the musician in the family, and the box is the perfect size for slipping into a stocking this Christmas. They also help with a strong, balanced sound to my ear. I'm not a professional musician, but I like how these hold up to casual playing. They will help retain a strong sound and not hurt your mouth in any way.
