I like the board, it is a good size, is thick enough that you know you won't damage anything under it.<br />My beef with it is that it needs a really fine sanding, the surface is a little rough, not as smooth as I would like. It will also take a lot of oiling to help smooth it.<br />As for cutting, I have no problem chopping away on it, but it does scar a bit with heavy chopping. Normal chopping and slicing etc. are just fine, no difference from my more expensive cutting boards.<br />I would have given it 5 stars if the finish had just been smoother. (I think I'm going to take the ultra-fine sander to it.)
