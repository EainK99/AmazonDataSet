I've had this particular Neotech strap for at least 10 yrs - yea, can't believe it myself sometimes. Would've given 5 stars, but falls short on the end pin hole. Martin has a bigger instrument jack, and it didn't fit due to strap hole being too small. But I improvised with a drill bit, and it's been good. It does make my full size dreadnought comfortable even after playing for over an hour non stop. But now I think I'll try the Slim lock style by Neotech - so either way you still have my business.
