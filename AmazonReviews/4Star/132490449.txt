I really like the sound I get when I use this rosin, but the other reviews weren't kidding about the packaging.  There is no box, just the thick cloth it's attached to with an elastic band and button to secure it.  The rosin wasn't smooth. - it looked like it had been melted and was disfigured, making it slightly harder to apply - which is why I took off a star.  Otherwise, it works great!
