The sound on these is pretty good for the price. Actually they're pretty good in general. It's naturally a little heavy on the bass, but depending on what you hook these up to you can correct for that. I find that they push a tiny bit hard on my ears so I can't just walk around with these for hours on end, but that's alright. A solid buy.
