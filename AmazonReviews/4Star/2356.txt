well....i got mine for a a whole lot less than this price so that is one reason i love mine....it was a demo model....in original box for almost 1/2 this price.....i would not pay the current  price for one.....the reverb on this amp is not good, at all, trust me, it is awful....if you dont use reverb, then you will not care.......i use my Boss Fender REverb pedal, which sounds really great ....i use a MArshall Compressor and whatever kind of overdrive pedal.....this amp will get super loud with a lot of bottom....i use a Telecaster with duncan stack pickups....i can dial in a huge fat bottom heavy jazz tone.....really it is amazing...for solo playing..you could do any solo jazz gig with this amp and those pedals.......any rock or country gig......the amp is very light..no buzz or vibrations, so far. easy to pickup and carry, that's why i bought it....i can't lift an AC-15 or AC-30 and the AC-4 is too under-powered for my needs....the 10&#34; speaker in this amp needs a good breaking in...it sounds like ass for a while then it loosens up good....it is physically impossible to install any other 10&#34; speaker due to the amp's weird design....trust me...i tried...nothing else any good will fit....i did replace the 2 12ax7 tubes with some new EH models....improved the sound....so far i just left the original EL84's alone, but may someday spring for a good pair....mostly this amp needs to be played hard for a good week or two to deliver a good sound....i guess you could gig with it with just a guitar and a chord , if you just sorta strum and sing..it might be just fine for that, its got the volume for it....good for a Beatle act...you can make it overdrive just by adjusting the gain and volume  knobs., but it wont sound anywhere as good as a good quality overdrive pedal.....it has the Vox high end sound but you can also make it sound sorta like a Fender, by turning the knobs....its versatile, good sounding , loud and light...to me, it just needs  a good front end boost from a pedal or two to start a happening sound.......the price seems to have gone way up since it was first released, i dont know why that is...... you might still find it worth the price but if you start trying to change tubes you will be adding maybe 75 more dollars , making it a 500 dollar amp..it sounds way way better than ANY OF THE VOX MODELING AMPS..it sound real.....i would not recommend wasting any money on those  modeling amps if you are going to gig..but for home use , they are your own business.....from a pedal or two to start a happening sound.......the price seems to have gone way up since it was first released, i dont know why that is...... you might still find it worth the price but if you start trying to change tubes you will be adding maybe 75 more dollars , making it a 500 dollar amp..it sounds way way better than ANY OF THE VOX MODELING AMPS..it sound real.....i would not recommend wasting any money on those  modeling amps if you are going to gig..but for home use , they are your own business.....
