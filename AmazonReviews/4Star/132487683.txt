The good:<br />- It connects and works great with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 10.1.<br />  (Just FYI: I am using a very handy app called MobileSheets.)<br />- It's pretty light-weight and easy to carry around.<br />  (Doesn't add weight to my gig bag.)<br /><br />The not-as-good: (But not too bad)<br />- The device's 10-minute auto power-off feature could be longer for my preference.<br />  (I have to occasionally tap the switch to make sure it's still on.)<br />- It is pretty light weight. Although I don't think I could say it's cheap and poorly constructed. You might have to stomp on it pretty good to break it.<br />  (Tap on it, don't stomp on it.)<br />- I might like a bit more feedback with the switch, and feel a good \\"click\\" under my feet. Although I understand it may be a nuisance for other's to hear constant \\"clicking\\" while they're performing or reading in a quiet environment.<br />  (of course a simple solution is to plug other switches into the device.)
