It's very lightweight compared to the school trumpet my daughter borrowed until we got this one.  I played trumpet in high school, and when the trumpet arrived, I played a couple songs on it.  The sound was just as good as on my daughter's school trumpet, but the keys were a little stiff.  I assumed they probably needed oiled, and I gave it to my daughter to do that.  She said they were better after she oiled them.
