first off the tone difference from &#34;normal patch cables&#34; to the lava was nice. things sound a little more full. almost like standing next to your amp vs across the room. yes its louder but its still fuller as u haven't lost some freq due to the bouncing around the room by the time it gets to u. is it huge yes and no worth the money yes and no up to up lol.  i will say putting them together was kind of a pain and the butt. some went in easy others bent the cable and i had to straight it back out and try again and again.... id still get them again if i had to do it all over again tho. the cleaner look on my board is great. i give it a 4 just because it was sorta a pain in the butt and the price is a bit high for what u get. yes its nice but always hard to justify a price if u low on money lol u defiantly want to double check your measurements  before u cut. a few mistakes and your out another 50 bucks for another set to finish what u started if u ran out of cable.
