My background: Bassist 46 years, gigging musician for a Classic Rock Tribute band North Jersey.<br /><br />I recently purchased the Silent Bass and I wasn't expecting a great player just really loved the design.<br />It came in a flat box wrapped in foam paper material and foam cut outs for the horns to protect during shipping.<br />The strings were also cover with a brown packing paper and the box was tape well at every corner. I cut off the tape and unwrapped the bass.<br />The craftsmanship was better than I expected no large gaps or misaligned parts. The bass uses a 9 volt battery to power the pickup which it included with the bass as well as the other items mentioned in the sellers description.<br />I put the 9 volt in and plug in the headphones and was pleasantly surprised at the volume it produced so as you can guess I couldn't wait to plug it into an amp.<br /> I plugged into my 100 watt Fender Rumble 1*15\\" speaker and it sound great clean and punchy. The fretwork is good and no dead spots on the neck. The setup was good the bass tuned and stay in tune and the harmonics were accurate.<br />The string action was a little higher than I am used to but in no way did it hinder the playability, the pots were smooth and no humming so electronics are well grounded.<br />The next test was a live show which I used it on recently and it passed the test with flying colors everyone loved the sound and the look of my new bass so I am very happy with this purchase. Only negative I have to add is a case was not available at purchase time and I use a double gig bag and the wide acoustic type body was a snug fit to say the least. But overall I was satisfied with my purchase and I would buy from this seller again.
