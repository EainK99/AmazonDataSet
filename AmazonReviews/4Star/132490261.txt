I paid about $25 with prime shipping. Holds my mac safe and secure with more room on my desk than ever. It looked like it doubled the space on my desk but it honestly freed up only about a third of it. The main concern I have to voice to consumers is this isn't the  high rise of computer stands like it looks to be and some of the images are misleading. It says to place minimum of 2 empty spaces in between the crossbars to properly support your computer. This makes the stand shorter than the stock image amazon uses which shows only one space in between. With that in mind at the proper 2 spaces it still raises my mac higher than 75% of the competition and at 50% of the price with a much sturdier lip and base to keep my valuables valuable. Would have put 5 stars for the product itself but took off 1 star for the misleading images that amazon and others have posted.
