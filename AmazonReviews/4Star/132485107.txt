This is a really nice step up from the a900x!  This can is quite a looker as well.  It will definitely turn head, but most importantly it sounds very good.  I purchased my pair used for $350 and it was really a great deal.  I'm not sure they are worth $550+, but they are a very good can.  I feel it beats out most mid-fi cans, but it is priced higher than most, so that should be a given.  For a closed headphone it actually has a very large soundstage.<br /><br />I own the W5000x and although that is my favorite headphone for Classical, these are by far a more well rounded headphones.  They can do a lot of genres extremely well.  They have good separation and I find them to be closer to neutral than the 900x's but they still have that Audio-technical sound.  So these are very fun and forgiving headphones  The wing system on these actually work well.  They are not as cumbersome as the w5000x's, but they still might not be the best portable solution.<br /><br />They have a fairly low impedance and are very easy to drive. They have nice tight bass.  The mids may be a tad recessed, but the highs are very clear but don't become sibilant or harsh.  They are not the best isolating cans I have, but should be quiet enough for the work place.  If you can snag a pair of these on the cheap, you won't regret it!
