These were my first over ear headphones and I do really, really like them. The sound quality was like I'd never experienced, and they are extremely comfortable on the ears. I'm not an experienced audiophile so I will defer to the others on the technical aspects of the product, but I want to add one point. I wear glasses. These will definitely shift your frames which will give you a headache if you're reading or listening for an extended period of time, and sometimes squeeze them against your temples, which can be uncomfortable. I think it's just the nature of the beast, but I wanted to point it out to any other bespectacled folks out there. When I run into these issues, it usually takes about 3 or 4 readjustments before I'm comfortable again. Other than that, overall a fantastic product that I really enjoy using.
