On a music stand, these are bright enough so that they are comfortable - if they were any brighter they'd be sort of a pain for me to use - but they do the job very well and I like the ability to position a light over each page.  The batteries last a long time (I'm estimating 6-7 months with about two hours of daily use).  They are compact and rugged enough to throw into a bag.<br /><br />The one nitpick I have is that the light has a bit of wiggle once in position and would be better with a felt or rubber pad in the clip. I glued a 1x1 inch piece of rubbery shelf liner to the inside of the clip and it improved it immensely. Other than that, I like the light very much.
