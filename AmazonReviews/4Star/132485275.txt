When it comes to grandchildren it's &#34;nothing but the best&#34;!  I knew he loved practicing playing his guitar, but had no idea why this strap was so important.  All I knew was he wanted one, so of course, I ordered it.  When I gave it to him, he told me it was perfect...It adjusted down enough to fit him and he liked the strong feel. He was able to attach it to the neck with the string tie.  He loves to perform even more now that he has his new strap.  He's happy and I'm a hero!  Doesn't get any better.
