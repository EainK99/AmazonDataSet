I initially purchased these to hold my home server. Right now it is in a traditional mid-tower instead of a rack mountable case. Ended up doing the rack a bit differently and did not need them for that. Instead I am using them as cable management channels .<br /><br />My only complaint is that they work on a short rack, but not really the best. My rack is of the Lack Rack variety so they are not extended at all, only 19&#34; depth. Each rail is two pieces. The outer piece of the rails flex out when mounted at this shallow of a depth. This is more of a nitpick than anything though. They are cheap and much more wasn't expected out of them. The point is about moot since I am using them for cable management and have zip ties on it. Just a heads up for anyone going the Lack Rack route like I did.
