The amp works great, and was lasting long until it just recently stopped holding a charge as long as it used to. So I took the battery out and looked it up online and found this.<br />[[ASIN:B0009GIKNE B0009GIKNE]]<br />This might work, I just ordered it and will try and replace it soon and see if that helps.
