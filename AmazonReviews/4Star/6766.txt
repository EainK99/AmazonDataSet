Would have given it 5 stars, because it works fine, but I had to replace the hose between the pump and the reservoir right out of the box. As soon as it started trying to pump fluid the hose would pinch itself off and fold over. Hose was way longer than needed putting the pick-up body right next to the cap instead of at the bottom of the tank and the hose was just way too long outside of the housing. I removed the hose, replaced with some Tygon fuel hose and a small zip-tie and it pumped through great. Decent amount of fog for a 400 Watt machine and heat up times between puffs isn't too bad at all.
