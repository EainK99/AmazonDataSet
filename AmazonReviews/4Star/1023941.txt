I was cruising around about interfaces and came here and seen some bad reviews . Look there's good and bad in any mass produced product .<br /><br />Lexicon has a name that is respected and well earned but I know when accountants are involved all bets are off . But let me tell you my story .<br /><br />First is I bought I-onyx u42s off eBay . Everything about met my needs . I had some issues that were miner like balance and noise . I called repair not CS or CS gave me the repair number it's been awhile so I don't remember .<br /><br />What I can tell you is that I was treated as an A1 customer and yeah they charge a 80.00 bench fee and that's fantastic I don't about you but take any electronic gear to a repair and there's a fee .<br /><br />I had no warranty and the fee is for checking it out to see what's what that's only fair . The 80 bucks goes to repair cost as well so win !<br /><br />They took my unit cleaned , repaired and upgrade the software for 80 dollars and I had back with in two weeks . Thank you Lexicon well done .<br /><br />I've been using the unit powered on for something like 3 yrs  and she's running fine . My only peeve and one that I can't prove is better then any other units except m-audio pro and that served its purpose.<br /><br />So I'm thinking upgrading to the newer unit without regret . Everything I record has been strictly using the I-onyx u 42s . Here's a link to my music on sound cloud using direct plug via TRS and microphones with XLR's  I'm not great I'm not selling that I'm selling the io 42s .<br /><br />If you have an issue with them email me and help you  get It resolved fairly and I ain't know one special that's how much I believe in lexicon get a hold of me through SC here's my link . Only four stars because of pre-amp noise ... Tis a minor thing if you know how to work it .<br />Thanks<br />Ags<br />https://soundcloud.com/agradeleous234
