This product did the job I expected it to.  I mainly use it for setting up rhthym tracks to practice lead guitar with.  I wish I would have had something like this 20 years ago when I began playing guitar.  Some say it is a &#34;one trick pony&#34; and I would agree with that.  On the other hand one of the fancy loopers with 10 buttons/switches would have driven me nuts and I wouldn't have used it as effectively.  It takes some getting used to so you can learn how to start and stop a loop without unwanted noise at the beginning or end of the loop.  I would also like to begin using it with my band as a way to add an additional guitar rhthym part but so far I've only tried that during practice session.
