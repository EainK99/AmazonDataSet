The kit FINALLY arrived after several weeks, but then again, it did ship from China.  The kit was poorly packaged.  The wood parts appear like they just came off the CNC machine - covered in sawdust; the drill holes were not sanded so there were raised chips on all of them.  The machined pockets were pretty rough looking too, like they had been put in by hand.  The twelve string neck head stock has a small knothole defect on its face so that will definitely get filled and painted.  All the hardware, strings and electronics were coated with an oily preservative, and they were not separated by item - they were all mixed up in various bags.  The electronics and strings are very cheap.  Throw them away and buy replacements from a reputable source.  I did keep the humbucker pick-ups but will replace these at some point when I have the funds  Also, I received two neck nuts of cheap plastic and they were both cut for six strings - threw them away too, along with the pot knobs which were very cheap and flimsy.  Sounds like I'm disappointed but actually I expected all of this.  The point is: this kit is a starter.  What you really want is a decent guitar body and necks made of decent wood and have them cut as close to reliable specifications as possible.  This kit gives you this.  The necks are maple, straight and decently made.  The body is basswood and in good shape.  In the end you want quality instrument and the necks and body in this kit give you a solid foundation.  It’s all in the finishing.<br />The string tuners were surprisingly decent as were the bridges, various covers, and pick guards so I kept these.  I did buy new CTS pots, Switch-Craft 3-way toggle switches, CTS jack, .022uf capacitors, Graph Tech nuts, new wire, new strings and Gibson Speed Knobs.  When finished, this guitar should sound great.  So would I recommend this kit?  Absolutely.
