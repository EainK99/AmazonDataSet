My main complaint was that the box it was shipped in was open on one end, and then Amazon put it inside a big long box with very little packing material, so when the package arrived the bow was rattling around in the box unprotected.  Thankfully, I was using the bow to demonstrate how to rehair a bow, so it didn't really matter if it would actually play a violin or if it had some nicks on it.  What little I have used it to play a violin has not been with the original hair, but it seems to do the job adequately.
