I purchased a used Peavey amp without the two-button footswitch. This worked perfect. It's been a couple of months and it is still working great. You will need to purchase a cord to go with it and since it is two button, you will need a 1/4 inch stereo cable (TRS) to operate both functions, in my amp's case, reverb and channel.
